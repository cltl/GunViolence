A 25-year-old previously convicted felon has been charged with murdering a man outside of a Brooklyn strip club
Tony Hampton, 25, of St. Louis, was charged with one count of first-degree murder and one count of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon, according to St. Clair County Stateâ€™s Attorney Brendan Kelly.
Hampton is alleged to have shot 29-year-old Berkely, Mo., resident Salahudin Malik Robbins outside the Bottoms Up strip club at just before 3 a.m. Dec. 13.
The club is located at 307 Jefferson St.
Robbins died of multiple gun shot wounds. At least three other people were wounded in the shooting.
Neither police nor prosecutors have revealed what they believe was the motive for the shooting.
Illinois State Police Sgt. Chris Hoffstot said at the time of the shooting that investigators hoped to use surveillance camera footage to identify the suspect. Police also sought the input of witnesses through anonymous tip lines.
Hampton was also charged with unlawful possession of a weapon by a previously convicted felon for carrying the .380-caliber handgun used in the shooting, according to Kelly.
He has been jailed on $1 million bail.
It was the second shooting at the club in a year. On Dec. 14, 2014, a pair of men got into an argument behind the club and shots rang out. The victim was shot several times in the torso but survived.
In April, a man was shot to death inside another Brooklyn strip club, the Pink Slip. In March, two men were shot outside the Pink Slip.
