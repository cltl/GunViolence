An inspector general found in 2014 that some veterans had faced delays in receiving as much as $25,000. One employee carted papers from her home in a suitcase, inspectors said, and one had some 8,000 documents stashed in his office.\\n\\nThe VA has replaced the office's leadership in an effort to address the problems.\\n\\nFrink served 11 years in the Army before a medical discharge in 2004. He said he was injured during a training exercise in hand-to-hand combat.\\n\\nHis problems began when he was hired by the VA in February 2013, investigators for the special counsel wrote in a 19-page report on his case.\\n\\nFrink had filed a benefits claim seeking years of back payments. Now the claim had to be transferred to another office so it would be handled impartially. But officials could not find the paperwork.\\n\\n\\\"This caused Frink serious concern since the VA could not begin work on his claim until his folder was transferred to another facility,\\\" investigators wrote. \\\"And even after it was finally transferred, he might still face a long wait for the retroactive payments to be processed and distributed.\\\"\\n\\nFrink sought help from his supervisor, whose name is redacted in the report, and from the independent organization Disabled American Veterans.\\n\\nIn June 2013, Frink sent Mikulski a letter asking for her help. The Baltimore Sun had reported that the Baltimore office was the worst-performing in the country, with high error rates and long wait times for decisions, and Mikulski was demanding improvement.\\n\\nFrink was fired in July. Officials said in a letter that he had misused his identity badge, failed to follow instructions from his bosses, taken time off improperly, and threatened a colleague.\\n\\nFrink, who enlisted in the Army 1993 and played piano in its jazz band, said he had documented his conversations with his supervisors, which gave him confidence when he took his case to the Office of Special Counsel.\\n\\n\\\"Everything was trailed in black and white,\\\" he said. \\\"I know when I looked at the termination there was no credibility to it.\\\"\\n\\nThe special counsel's office concluded that the VA fired him because he had sought Mikulski's help and that managers who were interviewed by investigators provided testimony that was \\\"inconsistent and lacked candor.\\\"\\n\\nThe investigators recommended disciplinary action against two supervisors in the VA office, but did not name them or describe the proposed sanctions.\\n\\nThe report was only the second of its kind released by the Office of Special Counsel, which hopes it will shine a light on retaliation faced by federal employees who expose problems in government.\\n\\nTypically, federal agencies reach an agreement with the special counsel before a formal report is drafted, spokesman Nick Schwellenbach said.\\n\\nVA officials say the Baltimore office has cut the backlog of cases and sped the time in which decisions are made.\\n\\nAfter his first day back, Frink said the change was clear. Now a financial accounts technician, he said new systems are working well and morale seems greatly buoyed.\\n\\nAnd as for his paperwork? The missing file was eventually found under a desk in the Baltimore office, Frink said, and his claim was sorted out this year.\",\"dct\":\"2015-09-08\",\"source\":\"http://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-md-ci-va-whistleblower-20150908-story.html\"},{\"title\":\"VA employee fired for seeking help from Congress gets job back\",\"content\":\" Veterans Affairs Department employee who was fired for contacting his senator to report problems at the department is back on the job this week after a two-year legal fight that ended with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel chastising VA officials.\\n\\nThe news comes amid continued criticism from lawmakers about VA's treatment of whistleblowers and commitment to fixing internal problems instead of covering them up.\\n\\nOSC officials said they hope the case will serve as a warning to VA leaders and staffers to take such reports more seriously, and to follow the law.\\n\\n\\\"The constitutional right to petition Congress must be guaranteed for all Americans,\\\" Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said in a statement. \\\"Federal agencies cannot deny their employees this right even if it leads to scrutiny of their operations.\\\"\\n\\nIn February 2013, disabled Army veteran Bradie Frink was hired as a clerk at the VA's Baltimore Regional Office.

The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle, alleges that the clinic fired Stephanie Binschus from her position as a blood collection specialist in February of 2014 using the specious justification that she had falsified documentation in the clinic\u2019s donor database by stating that she is female. She had worked at the clinic since October of 2013.\\n\\nAccording to her complaint, Ms. Binschus had been a long-time blood donor at the Center. She completed her transition before her employment there, and her supervisors were aware that she had been issued a Washington State birth certificate that recognised her as female. Ms. Binschus\u2019 job duties as a blood collection specialist included making entries on the donor database and she was permitted to change inaccurate entries to the database. She noticed her own clinic donor record still designated her as male. After the clinic changed its policy to permit donors to self-identify at the first stage of the donor process, she updated her own record to correct the inaccuracy, and to accurately reflect her female status. Other employees had also made changes to their own database information without being terminated. But immediately after she made the change, Binschus was singled out, subjected to a superficial investigation, in which she was not interviewed by her supervisors or human resources to find out her side of the story, and subsequently fired for \u201cfalsification of documentation.\u201d\\n\\nThe lawsuit alleges that less than two months prior to her termination, Binschus\u2019s supervisors had suggested that her transgender identity was too \u201ccontroversial\u201d to be welcome at the clinic. One supervisor advised that she was not allowed to have a transgender-focused college library book with her at work or pamphlets with \u201ctransgender information\u201d because the supervisor considered them \u201ccontroversial materials.\u201d That same supervisor criticised Ms. Binschus for allowing her advocacy for transgender issues to interfere with her work or the workplace environment. Yet another supervisor referred to Ms. Binschus as \u201chis/her\u201d in an email at the time of her termination.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that Bloodworks Northwest did not truly understand that Ms. Binschus is a woman,\u201d said Jillian T. Weiss, Ms. Binschus\u2019s attorney, who represents her along with J. Denise Diskin of Seattle\u2019s Teller & Associates PLLC. \u201cThe anti-transgender office climate engendered by supervisors reveals that the clinic believed that Ms. Binschus\u2019s statement that she is female was false. The clinic terminated her on the basis of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits unlawful sex discrimination. Sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of gender and gender identity.\u201d Gender identity refers to characteristics related to a person\u2019s internal sense of gender, being male, female, or other. It is generally accepted in the medical field that gender identity is intractably rooted in the psyche at a very young age, and cannot be changed. The State of Washington permits people to submit documentation from a physician to request recognition of their sex on a state birth certificate.\\n\\nThe lawsuit asks the court to rule that Bloodworks Northwest be directed to stop subjecting employees to sex discrimination (including on the basis of gender, gender identity, gender expression, gender transition, and sex stereotypes), institute new policies and train its employees, and compensate Ms. Binschus for the monetary damages she suffered, such as lost income.\\n\\n\u201cThis case sends a very strong message: transgender employees should never face discrimination for being who they are.\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBloodworks Northwest is a very important community organisation with a very important mission \u2014 saving lives through blood donation. It is with great regret that we feel constrained to bring a lawsuit against a life-saving non-profit organisation. Nonetheless, no one is above the law. Bloodworks Northwest violated Ms. Binschus\u2019s federal civil rights by failing to respect her gender and firing her for saying she is female. It is time for the company to right this wrong and ensure this never happens to other transgender employees.\u201d\",\"dct\":\"2015-09-01\",\"source\":\"http://mysocalledgaylife.co.uk/2015/09/transgender-woman-files-federal-lawsuit-against-seattle-blood-clinic-for-sex-discrimination/\"}]", "str:filip:txt:FR105119": "[{\"title\":\"Galleria-area complex fire tamed\",\"content\":\"As the evening rush hour approached, Houston firefighters were watching hot spots after fighting a raging four-alarm fire today in an unoccupied Galleria-area apartment complex all afternoon.\\nOfficials were asking Houston drivers to avoid the area.\\nThe fire at the Regency Arms Apartments in the 6400 block of San Felipe near the Galleria had been contained to one building a couple of hours after the fire was reported about 1 p.m. this afternoon, fire officials said.\\nBy 4:30 p.m., firefighters were standing by to contain hot spots.\\nHFD was dispatched at 1:08 p.m. to the complex at San Felipe at Winrock.

Melendez is named in a pending lawsuit by Inkster resident Dashawn Acklin, who contends that officers entered a home he was visiting and, though he was compliant, choked and beat him until he lost consciousness.

The show, which Clarkson hosted with Richard Hammond and James May, has an estimated 350 million viewers around the world, and the premiere episode of its 22nd season was simulcast in more than 50 countries.\\n\\nBut there\u2019s another reason so much attention was paid to Clarkson\u2019s fate: his history of being, well \u2026 Jeremy Clarkson. That is to say, controversial.\\n\\nHere is a guide to what led to Clarkson\u2019s firing and some background on the now-former \u201cTop Gear\u201d host\u2019s previous tussles with management.\\n\\nWhy was Jeremy Clarkson fired? \\n\\nOn Wednesday, the BBC released quite a few details about what led to the dismissal.\\n\\nIt began on March 4, when Clarkson was in a North Yorkshire hotel with, among other people, show producer Oisin Tymon. Clarkson and Tymon had a \u201cfracas.\u201d Per BBC\u2019s news division: \u201cThe row \u2026 was said to have occurred because no hot food was provided following a day\u2019s filming.\u201d\\n\\nThe BBC investigation found that the attack lasted about 30 seconds, during which Tymon did not retaliate. Clarkson continued directing \u201cverbal abuse\u201d at Tymon after a witness intervened in the physical assault. Clarkson\u2019s verbal abuse included \u201cthe strongest expletives and threats to sack him,\u201d and was \u201cat such volume as to be heard in the dining room.\u201d Clarkson continued using \u201cderogatory and abusive language\u201d towards Tymon and other members of the production team for a \u201csustained period of time.\u201d\\n\\nTymon believed he had lost his job following the altercation. He went to the hospital for examination.\\n\\nHowever, the report says, Tymon did not file a complaint against Clarkson. Instead, after \u201cClarkson made a number of attempts to apologise to Oisin Tymon by way of text, email and in person\u201d over the next several days, the star presenter reported himself to BBC management.\\n\\nAs a result, he was suspended on March 10.\\n\\nIn announcing the decision not to renew Clarkson\u2019s contract, which expired this month, BBC Director General Tony Hall said that \u201ca line has been crossed. There cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another dictated by either rank, or public relations and commercial considerations.\u201d\\n\\nOkay, but you said Clarkson was  already controversial. Why?\\n\\nClarkson has a habit of saying things, often intended as a joke, that prompt outrage. There are enough examples for entire listicles, but let\u2019s take a look at a few:\\n\\n\u2022 In 2008, while driving a truck on \u201cTop Gear,\u201d Clarkson made a joke implying that \u201cmurder[ing] a prostitute\u201d is a common pastime for professional truck drivers. The joke prompted at least one elected official to call for his firing.\\n\\n\u2022 In 2009, Clarkson apologized after calling then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown a \u201cone-eyed Scottish idiot.\u201d Brown is blind in his left eye.\\n\\n\u2022 In 2011, the BBC received more than 20,000 complaints from viewers after Clarkson responded to a question on \u201cThe One Show\u201d by making a joke about \u201cexecuting\u201d striking workers in front of their families.\\n\\n\\n\u2022 In May 2014, Clarkson announced that he was on \u201cfinal warning\u201d from the BBC, saying he would lose his job if he makes \u201cone more offensive remark, anywhere, at any time.\u201d That was shortly after British media accused Clarkson of saying the N-word in an unaired clip from a 2012 \u201cTop Gear\u201d episode. Clarkson also apologized for that controversy: \\n\\n\\n\u2022 Oh, and one time he punched Piers Morgan, who was, until recently, his public nemesis.\\n\\nBut Clarkson is popular? \\n\\nYes! In fact, his history of cracking offensive jokes is, for some fans around the world, part of his enormous appeal. A change.org petition asking the BBC to reinstate Clarkson took in more than 1 million signatures. That petition was delivered to the BBC in a tank:\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough Clarkson\u2019s suspension and eventual termination stemmed from a physical altercation off air, many of his supporters saw it as a culmination of the BBC\u2019s past handling of the host\u2019s many controversies. \u201cI\u2019m signing because the far bigger evil is censorship via political correctness which the BBC have been indulging in for far too long,\u201d petition-signer Edward Prince wrote.\\n\\nDaniel Harter wrote: \u201cJeremy Clarkson represents the view of the majority of the licence paying public. We are sick of paying our license fee to be spoon fed your political correct left wing crap. Let people speak their mind and exercise their right to offend. At the end of the day, if you are offended by something on TV/radio, turn it off?\u201d\\n\\nDavid Chandler simply wrote:\u201dI hate the BBC lefties.\u201d\\n\\nClarkson is generally considered to be conservative, and he\u2019s friends with current Prime Minister David Cameron, who has called Clarkson \u201ca huge talent.\u201d But as the BBC explains, the personality \u201crarely\u201d weighs in on \u201cparty-political issues.\u201d Instead, the BBC notes, \u201chis role is seen by some as more of a tribune of disgruntled middle England.\u201d But, as The Post\u2019s Adam Taylor explained , Clarkson\u2019s popularity doesn\u2019t stop in the United Kingdom. \u201cTop Gear\u201d has a broad international appeal in some pretty improbable places:\\n\\nYet for all of Clarkson and company\u2019s old-school entitlement, it\u2019s largely their personalities that drive the show\u2019s international popularity. \u201cHis humor is so inappropriate and not at all what you hear on state TV \u2014 that must account for some of its appeal,\u201d the BBC\u2019s Darius Bazargan said of Clarkson\u2019s popularity in Iran in 2013, adding that Clarkson was  \u201cabout as opposite to [now former] President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as you can get.\u201d\\n\\nSo what happens to \u201cTop Gear\u201d now? \\n\\nThe BBC is going to try to keep the show on the air. But it will be difficult, as the broadcaster\u2019s own statement on Clarkson\u2019s firing makes clear:\\n\\n\u201cThe BBC must now look to renew Top Gear for 2016. This will be a big challenge and there is no point in pretending otherwise,\u201d the statement reads, noting that the company still has to decide what to do with the rest of the current season.\\n\\nIt is difficult to overstate the role that Clarkson, Hammond and May have played in making \u201cTop Gear\u201d successful. Sure, gearheads might watch the show for the cars. But a lot of its audience stays for the team\u2019s antics. And it looks like neither Hammond nor May is completely on board in continuing to do \u201cTop Gear\u201d without Clarkson.\",\"dct\":\"2015-03-25\",\"source\":\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/03/25/how-jeremy-clarkson-lost-his-job-as-top-gear-host/\"},{\"title\":\"Jeremy Clarkson sacked by the BBC: official\",\"content\":\"Jeremy Clarkson has been told that his BBC career is over and Top Gear will continue without him next year, the BBC director-general said\\nBy Anita Singh, Arts and Entertainment Editor2:16PM GMT 25 Mar 2015\\nJeremy Clarkson has been sacked for his \u201cunprovoked physical and verbal attack\u201d on a Top Gear producer, the BBC has confirmed.\\nThe presenter had failed to maintain \u201cstandards of decency and respect\u201d at work, Lord Hall said.\\nJeremy Clarkson's Twitter bio has been updated: \\\"I used to be a presenter on the BBC2 motoring show,Top Gear.\\\"\\n\u2022 Live: Jeremy Clarkson sacked by the BBC - follow the latest news\\nClarkson was found guilty of \u201ca physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature\u201d that left his victim, Oisin Tymon, in need of hospital treatment at an A&E department.\\nAnnouncing the news, previously reported in the Telegraph, Lord Hall said: \u201cIt is with great regret that I have told Jeremy Clarkson today that the BBC will not be renewing his contract.

The inspector general would have reported directly to the governor and would have been responsible for investigating \u201cthe operations, management and affairs of state agencies,\u201d including employee performance.\\n\\nThe legislation died in part because of the provision that the records be kept secret, and critics argued such a position was redundant because several agencies have similar positions and the Attorney General can already investigate potential corruption or fraud.\\n\\nThis AHCCCS case almost certainly will be held up as a reason an inspector general is necessary, even though critics of a Ducey-formed inspector general say this case illustrates why such a position is not necessary.\\n\\n\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear from day one that I take extremely seriously this administration\u2019s duty and commitment to following the law and protecting Arizona taxpayers,\u201d Ducey said in Wednesday\u2019s statement. \u201cThe fraudulent activities that led to this arrest are unacceptable, appalling, infuriating and have absolutely no place in state government.\\\"\\n\\nAgents began serving four search warrants at about 7 a.m. Wednesday at three Phoenix locations and one in Surprise. At least two of the locations were homes in north Phoenix, including one near Seventh Street and Thunderbird Road, which records show Veit owns, and another near Central Avenue and Desert Hills Drive.\\n\\nThe probe launched after a state employee alerted ACHHHS officials, according to Monica Coury, the agency's assistant director. The allegations immediately prompted an internal investigation by the agency\u2019s inspector general, in conjunction with the AG\u2019s office.
