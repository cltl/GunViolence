A Florida police union has beef with Arby\u2019s after an employee allegedly denied service to a police officer. Dade County Police Benevolent Association is calling for a national boycott of the fast food chain after Pembroke Pines Police Sgt. Jennifer Martin was told that an employee didn\u2019t want to serve her for being a police officer. Arby's Apologizes After Employee Denies Service to Uniformed Police Officer The police report said that a manager told Martin that employee Kenny Davenport didn\u2019t want to serve her because she\u2019s a police officer. The manager also reportedly laughed and said that Davenport was allowed to refuse service. Martin said she was worried about the condition of her food and got a refund. Davenport claims that this was all a joke, but the PBA wants the employees involved to be fired. \u201cIt is beyond comprehension and deeply troubling that a business would deny service to a law enforcement officer just for being a law enforcement officer [\u2026] This is yet another example of the hostile treatment of our brave men and women simply because they wear a badge. It is unacceptable and warrants much more than an apology. We support our brothers and sisters who wear the badge in Broward County and across the United States. Until corrective action is taken and the employees involved in this incident are terminated, we are calling for a national boycott of Arby\u2019s,\u201d Florida and Dade County PBA president John Rivera said in a statement. What do you think of the proposed boycott? Sound off in the comments.

Drive Auto. Indus. of Am , which made the joint employment doctrine the law of the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit adopted a \u201chybrid\u201d test that embraced both the common law of agency and the economic realities of employment. In setting out a nine-factor test, the Court emphasized that the element of \u201ccontrol\u201d remained the principal guidepost for determining whether multiple entities could be considered a plaintiff\u2019s joint employers. \n \n\r\n\tWith that emphasis on control in mind, the Court highlighted three factors as the most important: \n \n\r\n\t(1) which entity or entities have the power to hire and fire the putative employee is important to determine ultimate control; \n \n\r\n\t(2) to what extent the employee is supervised is useful to determine the day-to-day, practical control of the employee; and \n \n\r\n\t(3) where and how the work takes place is valuable to determine how similar the work functions of the plaintiff are compared to those of an ordinary employee. \n \n\r\n\tNow the National Labor Relations Board has weighed in on the joint employer doctrine in its August 27th decision, Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. d/b/a BFI Newby Island Recyclery, 362 NLRB No. 186 (August 27, 2015). While the Butler case addressed whether Drive Automotive and a staffing company were joint employers of worker supplied by the staffing company for the purposes of Title VII employment discrimination, the NLRB addressed whether BFI and a staffing company were joint employers of the staffing company workers whom a Teamsters union sought to represent. \n \n\r\n\tJust like the Fourth Circuit, the NLRB emphasized the element of control. The NLRB rejected any notion that control must be active, \u201cdirect and immediate.\u201d Instead, the NLRB ruled that a reserved authority to control may be enough: \u201cthe right to control is probative of an employment relationship \u2013 whether or not that right is exercised.\u201d The NLRB also stated that control exercised indirectly\u2014such as through an intermediary staffing agency\u2014would be sufficient to establish joint employer status. \n \n\r\n\tCertainly you may never be confronted with a union-related, collective bargaining situation, but this recent NLRB decision together with the recent Fourth Circuit opinion demonstrate a determined judicial and governmental reaction to the rapid expansion of staffing and subcontracting arrangements, contingent employment, and temporary employment through employment placement agencies and temporary help services. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the courts and governmental agencies are confronting and will continue to confront what they perceive as an improper misclassification effort to skirt the laws governing the employer-employee relationship."}]}, "BU2bcb54c48978473fa972afe7e7b6c209": {"time": "", "location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "participants": "", "numparticipants": "0", "articles": [{"title": "Ex-US State worker pleads not guilty in cyberstalking case", "dct": "2015-09-09T16:24:09Z", "source": "BU2bcb54c48978473fa972afe7e7b6c209_1", "content": "Wednesday, September 9, 2015 Ex-US State worker pleads not guilty in cyberstalking case 9:24 AM | Posted by Josie | Edit Post ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A former U.S. State Department employee accused of sending threatening emails to young women from his computer at the U.S. Embassy in London pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges.

Follow the fast food company\u2019s lead. \n \nFirst, be careful what you tweet . People will demand engagement, statements, and explanations. Do apologize but do not say anything certain until you have a plan for finding out what happened. Make sure the company\u2019s response is unified, consistent, and coming from an appropriate person. \n \nTry not to get caught up in the urgency of the moment. Even an emergency PR situation benefits from a little planning \u2014 you may not have much time to mull it over, but do carefully consider your words before speaking as you may risk more blunders.

The National Council for Human Rights in November 2012 said that 70 percent of women are harassed in the streets, public spaces and transportation. \n\nAlthough officials at the Ministry of Manpower say they have not received complaints of sexual harassment, a study by the Egyptian Labor Union\u00a0in 2014 shows that 30 percent of women in Egypt are subjected to verbal harassment in the workplace. \n\nThe study was conducted on 20,000 women whose ages ranged from 20 to 55. The highest harassment rates were reported in Cairo, where 70 percent of those surveyed said they were harassed at work, while Upper Egypt saw the lowest rate at 0.5 percent. \n\nThe study also indicates that 50 percent of women workers who face harassment in Cairo also face discrimination at work for speaking out against sexual harassment by their superiors. \n\nCairo Post office employee Noha Ahmed said that she was sexually harassed by a manager at the organisation who blackmails his victims and touches them inappropriately. \n\nAhmed said that she and her colleagues filed several complaints against him, which only led to a temporary transfer from his post to which her returned only to continue harassing them with impunity. \n\n\u201cLast February,\u201d she says, \u201cmy colleague filed a complaint against him at the administrative prosecutor\u2019s office but until this moment there has been no investigation.\u201d \n\nSamar Sami, who is part of the women\u2019s committee in the Alexandria chapter of Egypt\u2019s Democratic Workers\u2019 Union, receives tens of complaints from women workers every month but says none of them speak out. \n\n\u201cI never imagined the extent of sexual harassment women are subjected to in the workplace,\u201d she says. \n\nShe explained that such crimes are mostly committed by either superiors at work or clients. Women refuse to take any action because of the social stigma associated with this kind of crime, she says. They remain silent to protect their reputation or because the administration failed to take action in previous cases. \n\nSahar Osman, deputy head of the Egyptian Labor Union, believes that harassment is one of many acts of violence that women are subjected to in the public space, recommending innovative office designs that would minimize the opportunity for harassment. \n\nA culture of silence manifests itself in the almost non-existent number of complaints registered officially. \n\nThe press officer of the ministry of manpower Haitham Saeed says that the ministry has never received any sexual harassment complaints in the workplace. \n\nThe National Council for Women (NCW), however, received two such complaints between December 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015.

According to the ministry, the dermatology clinic, run by Dr. Isamu Yasuraoka, dismissed a full-time employee working as a nursing assistant after the woman became pregnant earlier this year. The Ibaraki Labor Bureau received her complaint and urged the clinic to rescind the action, first verbally in March, then twice in writing later in March and in May. When that failed to elicit a response, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry itself issued a formal letter in July urging the clinic to rectify the situation.

While initial review indicates the allegedly improper work was limited to one employee and did not present a significant and immediate public health risk, it raises questions about the reliability of some water testing data used by MDH\u2019s Environmental Health Division and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for projects going back to at least May 2013. In response, MDH removed the employee from lab duties and is bringing in external reviewers to conduct a thorough investigation. The initial focus is on 2,200 analyses conducted by the employee between May 2013 and May 2015. That is approximately 0.7 percent of the 325,000 total analyses performed during that time by the employee\u2019s section of the lab. The department is reprocessing the employee\u2019s sample analyses to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable. According to MDH Commissioner Ed Ehlinger, top priority will be given to reprocessing analyses associated with public water systems. The department has grouped projects and sites with suspect results into tiers based on the potential impact of flawed results. Those results considered most sensitive will be reanalyzed first. The top-priority group includes five public water supply systems (Edina, St. Louis Park, Spring Park, Kasota, and Brooklyn Center), several private drinking wells in Baytown Township and adjacent areas of Washington County, and private wells near the Lindala Sanitary Landfill site in Wright County. \u201cWe are concerned about this situation and we are making every effort \u2013 including contracting for outside laboratory assistance \u2013 to reanalyze the work as quickly as possible,\u201d Commissioner Ehlinger said. \u201cWe have an obligation to provide sound, science-based information to our partners and the public.\u201d The alleged misconduct involved analysis of drinking water and untreated groundwater and surface water. The samples were run to look for volatile organic compounds, and gasoline and diesel products. The evidence indicates the employee did not follow proper procedures to verify instrument calibration, and avoided quality control steps that may have generated weaker, less defensible results. No motive has been identified. MDH is taking multiple steps to prevent future misconduct. This includes external audits, closer supervision of analysts, and more robust internal review processes. The department will also be reviewing training, practices and procedures to determine what other changes may be warranted.

Haggen has been forced to close stores and lay off workers as it struggles with its expansion. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\nIt's yet another lawsuit in Haggen's troubled expansion. Haggen, a Pacific Northwest chain, bought 146 grocery stores from Albertsons and Safeway after the Federal Trade Commission forced them to be sold as part of a merger. The stores, which include 83 in California, were converted earlier this year.\nThis week, Haggen filed suit against Albertsons for allegedly sabotaging its store takeovers (Albertsons said the suit was \"completely without merit\"). Albertsons filed suit against Haggen earlier this summer claiming that Haggen failed to pay millions of dollars for inventory it took over. In the latest lawsuit, Sukiasian said her problems started in June, when the Vons store where she was originally employed was converted to the Haggen brand.\nOnce the Carpinteria store was changed to Haggen, Sukiasian said many items that were tagged with one price on the shelves ended up scanned as higher prices at the register, the lawsuit said.\nSukiasian brought up the problem with a Haggen employee responsible for pricing at several Haggen stores, the lawsuit said. She believed that kind of overcharging violated both state and federal laws banning false advertising as well as regulations governing weights and measures, according to the suit. cComments Got something to say? Start the conversation and be the first to comment. Add a comment 0 After several weeks passed with no response, Sukiasian emailed Bill Shaner, the Haggen executive responsible for California, Nevada and Arizona operations, and told him about the problem, according to the complaint.\nShortly afterward, Sukiasian said she was \"upbraided\" by a district manager and a Haggen executive for emailing Shaner, the lawsuit alleges. That executive also told a manager at the Carpinteria store to find a way to fire her, the suit said.\nSakiasian, who was eligible for retirement but wanted to work for another few years, ultimately retired in September instead of risking a termination, the lawsuit said.\n\"She was constructively discharged when she was made to choose between retiring and being terminated,\" the lawsuit said. Haggen \"acted with oppression, fraud, malice.\"\nThe lawsuit accuses Haggen of violating California laws banning retaliation against employees who report and seek to correct statutes designed to protect the public from deceptive business practices. Sukiasian is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\nHaggen said it \"has not been made\u00a0 aware of this lawsuit and, as such, cannot comment.\"\nThe Bellingham, Wash., company has had a tough time breaking into its new markets.\nShoppers have complained that Haggen's stores charge higher prices for the same products than the supermarkets they replaced.\nWhen its first California stores opened in March, about 1,000 items -- or about 2.5% of a store's products -- were erroneously overpriced at 10 supermarkets in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties.

Regular promotions meant he eventually became the general manager. Allen's job involved a variety of tasks, from clerical work to unloading and moving appliances. He was often referred to as a \"floater\" who regularly took on tasks in many different store departments when needed. \n \nAllen also apparently had a temper, disliked the store owner and often yelled at other workers. Then, one day while moving refrigerators at the warehouse, he felt a pain in his shoulder. It turned out to be a heart attack, and he underwent heart surgery. Allen spent a week in the hospital, and continued his recovery at home for several months without returning to work. \n \nThe store's owner stayed in frequent contact with Allen throughout his recuperation. However, Allen never provided a firm return date despite being asked for one. He did say that he eventually planned to return. At one point, the owner went to Allen's house, offered him a sedentary office position and breaks as needed if he would return to work. Allen never responded to the offer. \n \nThe owner then sent Allen a letter informing him that he was being terminated. The letter explained that Allen hadn't provided a return date, mentioned that the company had continued to provide health insurance and stated that Allen had complained about the stress of the job. It was clearly a letter drafted by a small business owner, not lawyers. \n \nAllen sued, alleging he had been fired because of a disability. He argued that the letter--by mentioning stress and medical bills--was proof that the store owner regarded Allen as disabled and fired him because of his disability. \n \nThe case went to a jury trial. The owner testified that he never treated Allen as disabled, but terminated him only when it was clear he wasn't going to provide a return date. He explained that he mentioned health insurance in the letter only to remind Allen how much the company had tried to help him during his illness. \n \nThe owner also explained to the jury that Allen hadn't been a perfect employee and that he had been terminated for poor behavior toward subordinates and co-workers. \n \nThe jury sided with the store's owner. Allen appealed, but the 5th Circuit refused to overturn the jury's verdict. (Thomas v. Hill, No. 14-31186, 5th Cir., 2015) \n \nAdvice: When dealing with disabled employees, never discuss how much their medical problems may be costing you. \n \nAlthough the employer prevailed in this case, dealing with the sideshow created by mentioning health benefits added extra time and legal expenses to the litigation process. \n \nCopyright 2015 Business Management Daily, a division of Capitol Information Group, Inc.

The first felony charge carries a five-year maximum sentence, and the second has a 10-year maximum.\n\n\u201cWe cannot turn our heads when the law enforcer becomes the law breaker,\u201d Worthy said at a morning press conference.\n\nDent, 57, was pulled over in Inkster, a suburb of Detroit, on Jan. 28. Dashcam video shows that within seconds of Melendez approaching Dent\u2019s car, the officer began beating him, hitting him in the head more than a dozen times. Other officers kicked Dent and used a Taser on him. He had to be hospitalized for several days because of the injuries he received.\n\nMelendez, 46, later testified that Dent had said he was going to kill him, appeared to be under the influence of drugs and bit him. But Dent has said he didn\u2019t fight back.\n\nDent was initially charged with possession of cocaine and resisting and obstructing police. The resisting charge was dismissed by a judge last month, and Worthy said Monday that the drug charge would also be dropped \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d\n\nDent claims that officers planted cocaine in his car, an allegation that Worthy declined to comment on at the press conference.\n\nThe traffic stop beating came to the prosecutor\u2019s attention only last month, she said, when the video was published by Click on Detroit. The Inkster Police Department asked for Michigan State Police to begin the independent investigation that would lead to Melendez being charged not when the traffic stop occurred, but on the day that it received media attention, Worthy said.\n\nMelendez was fired from the Inkster Police Department last week, though he still works as a part-time officer for nearby Highland Park, according to the Detroit News.\n\nThe man has a history of misconduct allegations. Melendez is named in a pending lawsuit by Inkster resident Dashawn Acklin, who contends that officers entered a home he was visiting and, though he was compliant, choked and beat him until he lost consciousness. In 2004, while then a Detroit police officer, Melendez was acquitted on federal charges of stealing from suspected drug dealers and planting evidence. He was also involved in two fatal shootings of citizens while on the Detroit force.\n\n\u201cPublic confidence in the law enforcement is eroded \u200ewhen police officers abuse citizens,\u201d Worthy said Monday. \u201cThis devalues greatly the work that the majority of police officers in this country perform daily.\u201d\n\nThe video of Dent\u2019s arrest has sparked local protests and national scrutiny. He and his lawyer have said they believe race was a factor. Dent, who has no criminal record, is black, while most of the officers involved are white.\n\nRecent incidents such as Dent\u2019s beating have led to calls nationwide for cops to wear body cameras; many police departments, including Detroit\u2019s, are experimenting with the technology. Yet one lawyer said that what he found notable about Dent\u2019s arrest is that officers knew it was being recorded, but that fact seemingly had no impact on their actions.\n\nAt the press conference Monday, one reporter asked how Worthy\u2019s decision to charge Melendez was affected by the existence of a video documenting the beating.\n\n\u201cWe probably wouldn\u2019t know about it [without the video],\u201d she said.", "dct": "2015-04-20", "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/20/william-melendez-charged-floyd-dent_n_7100764.html"}]}, "BUdcf18a78f7814bb2a1d87c66120d6c9f": {"time": "", "location": "", "participants": "", "numparticipants": "0", "articles": [{"title": "Man Masquerading As Walmart Employee Walks Out The Door With Four Big Screen TVs", "dct": "2015-09-03T19:40:48Z", "source": "BUdcf18a78f7814bb2a1d87c66120d6c9f_1", "content": "Surveillance video shows a man posing as a Walmart employee stealing four large Samsung TVs.

In late July, Stephanie Barnett, the former director of the county\u2019s internal services division, won an award of $306,400, mostly in back pay damages. Jurors during a weeklong trial determined Montrose County violated the law in firing her when she requested to work part time in May 2013. Barnett was fired seven days after meeting with her former boss, Montrose\u2019s former county manager, Roy \u201cRick\u201d Eckert. Barnett\u2019s total award now is $771,411 and she and her attorneys plan to seek attorney costs and litigation costs that could reach a total of $1 million, said one of her attorneys, Nick Mayle with the law firm Killian, Davis, Richter & Mayle in Grand Junction. \u201cI think it\u2019s a significant award and I think it reflects that the jury and judge found that Ms. Barnett was subject to a lot of discrimination,\u201d he said. Mayle said the most recent ruling on Aug. 28 by U.S. District Court Judge James Parker was an award for Barnett\u2019s front pay, or an estimated amount of income she lost from the end of her trial into the future. Barnett\u2019s prior award by a jury of 12 residents was for back pay, or the amount of money she lost from the time of getting fired to the date of trial. According to the complaint, Eckert told Barnett her division would be dissolved because of \u201cbudgetary restraints\u201d at the county. However, she was the only employee to lose her job and Barnett\u2019s duties were taken over by another person. Montrose County has said in a statement that they \u201cconsider this case to be completely without merit.\u201d Montrose County has the option to file an appeal of both monetary awards. A media representative said Tuesday the county is awaiting judgment in the case and would not comment for a story. Barnett, who had worked for the county since November 2007, had an \u201cexemplary employment record and continuously received positive employment evaluations. Just a few months before her termination, Barnett was given an award by her peers for her work excellence,\u201d the complaint states.

Silva, who worked at the company from October 2014 to July 2015, names the Italian designer himself; Armani\u2019s New York-based retail subsidiary, Presidio International Inc.; chief operating officer Giorgio Fornari; and senior vice president of organizational development and human resources Lucinda Rosso, as defendants in the lawsuit.\n\nAccording to Silva\u2019s complaint, Armani and the company\u2019s execs retaliated against him after he reported to HR that a colleague made discriminatory comments to him based on his Mexican heritage in December 2014. Silva alleges that instead of taking action to remedy the discrimination he was subjected to, Giorgio Armani execs retaliated against him. Silva specifically notes that COO Giorgio Fornari denied his request for a salary adjustment (on the heels of his meeting with HR) and alleges that it was denied because he complained of discrimination. In a subsequent meeting with Lucinda Rosso, who heads up HR for the brand, Silva alleges that Rosso told him that if he was unhappy, he should leave the company.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all.

First, she was out with shingles. \n \nThen she had surgery for breast cancer, followed by chemotherapy and regular monitoring. During that time, her supervisor commented several times about Mary's possible retirement. \n \nMary eventually did retire\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\"and then sued, alleging that she could have continued working if she had been reasonably accommodated. \n \nMary explained that the continued cancer treatment made her very tired and that her physical condition made it hard to take the bus to and from work every day. \n \nShe had approached her supervisor and specifically asked for a reasonable accommodation: being allowed to work from home. \n \nThe supervisor turned down her request without further discussion, informing her that only those with fully satisfactory performance reviews were allowed to telecommute. He never asked how she thought working from home would improve her performance. \n \nThat's when, out of leave, Mary retired\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\"and sought out a lawyer who agreed to take her case. \n \nMary's resulting lawsuit alleged that she was constructively discharged when her accommodation request was rejected. Her prime contention was that OPM should at least have discussed whether working at home would have enabled her to continue doing her job. \n \nThe court agreed and ordered a trial. \n \nIt acknowledged that while Mary may have had performance problems, it was possible that her disability-related fatigue was the underlying cause. If that were the case, allowing her to work from home might have also improved her performance. \n \nThe court reasoned that, had OPM engaged in an interactive accommodations process, it might have found an accommodation that would have improved her performance and helped her cope with her disability while performing her job's essential functions. Simply dismissing her request based on presumptions about work and existing work rules could violate the Rehabilitation Act and a jury should decide if that's what happened here. (McIntyre v. Archuleta, No. 2:14-CV-00327, WD PA, 2015) \n \nFinal note: Imagine how this may play before a jury. An octogenarian with breast cancer and other disabilities wanted to keep working despite chemotherapy and other treatments but was forced to retire before she felt ready. She made a request to work from home, but her request was turned down without so much as a discussion despite almost three decades of service. \n \nBottom line: Always discuss possible accommodations, even if you think it's impossible to accommodate a disability. Document the entire process. \n \nAnd remember that the request doesn't have to be formal.

(DCI) violated federal law by firing and refusing to re-hire a long-time nurse who needed more medical leave to complete her cancer treatment, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged in a lawsuit it filed today.\n\nAccording to the EEOC's lawsuit, Francisca Lee had worked as a nurse at DCI's Sacramento Southgate location for 14 years when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Lee took medical leave in order to have mastectomy surgery and chemotherapy treatments. Four months later, DCI notified Lee by mail that she was being terminated for exceeding the time limit dictated by its medical leave policy, the EEOC said. This was done despite Lee being on approved medical leave and cleared by her doctor to return to work without restrictions in less than two months. Lee was told that she would have to reapply for open positions. However, when Lee did apply over two months later, she was rejected, and not long after, DCI hired a newly licensed nurse.\n\nTerminating a qualified employee because of a disability violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The law also requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee or job applicant with a disability, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship for the employer. After attempting to resolve the case through pre-litigation conciliation efforts, the EEOC filed the lawsuit (EEOC v. Dialysis Clinic, Inc.) in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California.\n\n\"Given the ADA's mandate, I would urge employers to be flexible concerning leave extensions if it causes no undue hardship,\" said EEOC San Francisco Regional Attorney William R. Tamayo. \"Ms. Lee had over 30 years' experience in dialysis treatment and really wanted to work. Our investigation showed that she only needed two more months to return to work. Why sacrifice a valuable employee with a good record over an arbitrary time limit?\"\n\nEEOC San Francisco District Director Michael Baldonado added, \"The purpose of the ADA is to ensure that people who are qualified and able to do the job can work without prejudice against disability to hold them back. After her doctor cleared her for work, Ms. Lee was passed over in favor of a far less qualified candidate. DCI's failure to re-hire Ms. Lee because of her disability, or record of disability, violated federal law and was just plain wrong. A healing facility such as DCI should especially understand that.\"\n\nAccording to its website (www.dciinc.org), DCI is a Nashville, Tenn.-based nonprofit corporation serving patients with advanced kidney disease.

You\u2019re likely one of the millions of Americans living in one of 25 Right to Work states. \n\nYou might not know it from Right to Work opponents\u2019 heated rhetoric, but Right to Work laws aren\u2019t hard to understand. They simply ensure that no employee can be forced to join or pay dues to a union. Not only does this enshrine workplace choice and protect employee freedom, it also brings a number of economic benefits to your home state. \n\nAccording to data compiled by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, Right to Work states have enjoyed higher private-sector job growth and larger wage increases over the past decade than their forced-unionism counterparts. No only that, but after adjusting for states\u2019 differing costs of living, residents in Right to Work states enjoy more disposable income than their non-Right to Work neighbors. \n\nThe connection between Right to Work laws and better economic performance shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. Business experts consistently rank the presence of Right to Work laws as one of the most important factors companies consider when deciding where to expand or relocate their facilities where they will create new jobs. \n\nRight to Work laws also encourage unions to be more flexible and responsive in the workplace. Where workers can\u2019t be forced to join or pay dues, union officials have to work harder to retain employee support. This encourages union officials to put workers\u2019 interests first, instead of simply looking out for their own privileges or pushing for policies that are out of step with the rank-and-file. \n\nRight to Work laws make plenty of economic sense, but protecting employee freedom has always been their most important feature. No worker should be forced to join or pay money to an organization he or she has no interest in supporting. Right to Work laws do nothing to impede employees from voluntarily joining or paying dues to a union; they simply ensure that no worker can be forced to contribute just to keep a job. \n \nIf you\u2019re still unsure where you stand on the Right to Work issue, ask yourself a simple question: Why shouldn\u2019t union officials play by the same rules as any other private organization? A labor union that enjoys genuine employee support will continue to thrive with funding from members\u2019 voluntary contributions. A union that has alienated the rank-and-file or outlived its usefulness will adapt quickly or whither on the vine. \n\nAcross the country, churches, civic associations, and thousands of other private organizations thrive on voluntarism. Many unions have followed their example and continue to prosper in Right to Work states across the country. Meanwhile, all Right to Work residents \u2013 non-union and union alike \u2013 benefit from more jobs and higher wages. \n\nWorkplace choice, employee freedom, and better economic performance are part and parcel of the Right to Work package. So what\u2019s not to like? This Labor Day, citizens of Right to Work states have much more to celebrate than a three-day weekend."}]}, "BU98fa407e0e584248b54469706e276788": {"time": "", "location": "", "participants": "", "numparticipants": "0", "articles": [{"title": "Employee Sickness is Putting Small Business Growth at Risk", "dct": "2015-09-14T13:21:07Z", "source": "BU98fa407e0e584248b54469706e276788_1", "content": "Staff sickness is potentially harming the growth of UK small and medium-sized businesses with 32% of firms having lost money due to employee sickness, according to new research by Bupa. \n \nThe study, which interviewed 500 small business owners, found that 46% of business leaders believed an employee taking an early short-term absence would be damaging for growth while 47% admitted their growth would be hampered if a worker took a significant period of absence. \n \nDespite the impact of staff sickness, the research found that small businesses are continuing to \u201cunderestimate the importance\u201d of factoring employee health in their future growth strategy. \n \nOnly 46% of business owners said that employee health and wellbeing is a key factor in their business plan and 43% of leaders admitted they have never considered introducing health and wellbeing benefits in their small businesses. \n \nRichard Norris, small and medium business director at Bupa, commented: \n \n\u201cEven one person on short-term sick leave can have a big effect on business growth and fellow colleagues in a small team.

Patty Murray (D-WA) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA). The WAGE Act is a positive step forward, addressing the shortcomings of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in the areas of workers protections and penalties for employers that violate workers' rights. \n\nThe legislation would amend the NLRA to further strengthen protections for both union and non-union workers by increasing remedies for workers and imposing new penalties for employers who act illegally. Implementation of the WAGE Act would go a long way toward fixing a broken system that favors employers, emboldening them to commit unfair labor practices with the full knowledge that even if they are caught, the penalties will be relatively minor. \n   \n\"For too long employers have manipulated and abused the system under the NLRA,\" said Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa . \"The WAGE Act offers real reform to our current laws and provides worker protections through significant penalties that will discourage employers from acting illegally. It is long past time to bring our labor laws into the 21 st century.\" \n\nHighlights of the proposed changes to the NLRA through the WAGE Act include: \nTripling backpay for workers who are illegally fired or retaliated against; Establishing civil penalties up to $50,000 for employers who commit unfair labor practices; Providing for federal court injunctions to immediately return fired workers to their jobs; Establishing NLRB authority to impose penalties on officers & directors of employer violators; Establishing NLRB authority to issue a bargaining order when it finds an employer prevented a free and fair election. \nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.4 million hardworking men and women throughout the United States , Canada and Puerto Rico .

The will of the highest court in the country seemingly meant nothing to her, and though it was an aggressive, and downright mean, act to perpetrate against a couple that simply wanted to get married (at its heart, Ms. Davis, that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, under the guise of religion), I still decided to let her nonsense play out. Let\u2019s be reasonable, something that people in support of Ms. Davis and \u201creligious freedom\u201d seem incapable of being. Kim Davis has been married four times. She\u2019s been divorced three times. If we\u2019re going to go by \u2018God\u2019s law\u2019 then Ms. Davis is already in for a hellaciously hot future. Targeting innocent gay and lesbian couples who want only to celebrate their love (as she got to do four times already) is not endearing her to anyone\u2019s God. I thought for sure the loonies would see that much, but they and Ms. Davis herself have proven capable of stupidity beyond my wildest imagination. Even then I joked a bit, saying that I didn\u2019t understand how someone so badly in need of a makeover could alienate so many gay men. But today, after her umpteenth appeal was denied, and after she still refused to do her damn job and issue marriage licenses, I\u2019m just pissed. I work for the government too, but if I behaved the way she did I\u2019d be disciplined big time. Her job is to issue marriage licenses, not administer a religious sacrament. There is a distinct separation of church and state written into the constitution, and it\u2019s there for precisely this reason. Let\u2019s say, for example, that my religion is fashion. Not a far-fetched example, quite frankly. And let\u2019s say that I\u2019m vociferously against Crocs and cargo shorts, that I think anyone who wears them is going to hell, and that I don\u2019t want to be affiliated with them in any way. As much as I\u2019d like to not help them, if my job calls upon me to provide information that they need to do their job, if I have to help them or support them in the course of the day, as a state worker I have to do so. I can\u2019t refuse because I don\u2019t believe in Crocs or cargo shorts. Or better yet, let\u2019s say that I don\u2019t believe in working a full day. My beliefs are that I need a siesta from noon to five, and after that I need a period to relax and meditate. It goes directly against the hours that I\u2019m supposed to work, but hey, those are my beliefs and everyone who knows me will most definitely attest to this. Can I just leave my job at noon based on these staunchly-held beliefs? That\u2019s exactly what Ms. Davis is doing right now. If it were anyone else, they\u2019d be disciplined, if not fired. How many times does she need to be instructed to uphold the law of the country and do her job as a government employee? I think she\u2019s had her chance. Either do your job, or resign.

The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle, alleges that the clinic fired Stephanie Binschus from her position as a blood collection specialist in February of 2014 using the specious justification that she had falsified documentation in the clinic\u2019s donor database by stating that she is female. She had worked at the clinic since October of 2013.\n\nAccording to her complaint, Ms. Binschus had been a long-time blood donor at the Center. She completed her transition before her employment there, and her supervisors were aware that she had been issued a Washington State birth certificate that recognised her as female. Ms. Binschus\u2019 job duties as a blood collection specialist included making entries on the donor database and she was permitted to change inaccurate entries to the database. She noticed her own clinic donor record still designated her as male. After the clinic changed its policy to permit donors to self-identify at the first stage of the donor process, she updated her own record to correct the inaccuracy, and to accurately reflect her female status. Other employees had also made changes to their own database information without being terminated. But immediately after she made the change, Binschus was singled out, subjected to a superficial investigation, in which she was not interviewed by her supervisors or human resources to find out her side of the story, and subsequently fired for \u201cfalsification of documentation.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that less than two months prior to her termination, Binschus\u2019s supervisors had suggested that her transgender identity was too \u201ccontroversial\u201d to be welcome at the clinic. One supervisor advised that she was not allowed to have a transgender-focused college library book with her at work or pamphlets with \u201ctransgender information\u201d because the supervisor considered them \u201ccontroversial materials.\u201d That same supervisor criticised Ms. Binschus for allowing her advocacy for transgender issues to interfere with her work or the workplace environment. Yet another supervisor referred to Ms. Binschus as \u201chis/her\u201d in an email at the time of her termination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that Bloodworks Northwest did not truly understand that Ms. Binschus is a woman,\u201d said Jillian T. Weiss, Ms. Binschus\u2019s attorney, who represents her along with J. Denise Diskin of Seattle\u2019s Teller & Associates PLLC. \u201cThe anti-transgender office climate engendered by supervisors reveals that the clinic believed that Ms. Binschus\u2019s statement that she is female was false. The clinic terminated her on the basis of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits unlawful sex discrimination. Sex discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of gender and gender identity.\u201d Gender identity refers to characteristics related to a person\u2019s internal sense of gender, being male, female, or other. It is generally accepted in the medical field that gender identity is intractably rooted in the psyche at a very young age, and cannot be changed. The State of Washington permits people to submit documentation from a physician to request recognition of their sex on a state birth certificate.\n\nThe lawsuit asks the court to rule that Bloodworks Northwest be directed to stop subjecting employees to sex discrimination (including on the basis of gender, gender identity, gender expression, gender transition, and sex stereotypes), institute new policies and train its employees, and compensate Ms. Binschus for the monetary damages she suffered, such as lost income.\n\n\u201cThis case sends a very strong message: transgender employees should never face discrimination for being who they are.\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBloodworks Northwest is a very important community organisation with a very important mission \u2014 saving lives through blood donation. It is with great regret that we feel constrained to bring a lawsuit against a life-saving non-profit organisation. Nonetheless, no one is above the law. Bloodworks Northwest violated Ms. Binschus\u2019s federal civil rights by failing to respect her gender and firing her for saying she is female.

He said it makes \u201clittle sense\u201d to link criminal charges filed against an employee to the adverse action process for employees because the attorney general\u2019s decision about whether to bring charges is made with \u201cvery different concerns in mind.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe attorney general might well intend to bring a criminal action within the three-year statute of limitations, but the Civil Service Commission would have to act as if the exception was inapplicable, simply because the criminal action hadn\u2019t yet been filed,\u201d Barcinas stated. \n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.guampdn.com/story/news/2015/09/03/fired-port-worker-loses-reemployment-case/71627696/"}]}, "BU4a85ebd4c74545f9a4408e8ff83189c1": {"time": "", "location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "participants": "", "numparticipants": "1", "articles": [{"title": "FIRED: Patron questions dismissal", "dct": "2015-09-04T07:00:00Z", "source": "BU4a85ebd4c74545f9a4408e8ff83189c1_1", "content": "Recently a dedicated and hardworking employee from Habitat ReStore was fired.

Doug Ducey\u200b's office.\n\nVeit had been a state employee for 35 years, state officials said. He began working at AHCCCS -- the state's Medicaid agency -- in May 1988 after working at the state Department of Corrections for eight years.\n\nAnother man, Michael Cameron, was arrested in connection with the investigation, but Garcia said he was not a state employee.\n\nDucey issued a statement Wednesday morning saying AHCCCS is launching an independently run audit and review of its internal protocols.\n\n\u201cDirector (Tom) Betlach took prompt action and immediately brought this to the attention of law- enforcement authorities,\u201d Ducey said in the statement. \u201cHe\u2019s assured me he will provide any and all necessary support to Attorney General (Mark) Brnovich and his office during its criminal investigation into this matter, which is underway.\u201d\n\nRyan Anderson, a spokesman for Brnovich, said employees have been working \u201caround the clock\u201d on the investigation since the allegations came to light about two weeks ago.\n\nThe arrest comes months after a bill that would have formed a new Office of State Inspector General died during the last legislative session.\n\nDucey had trumpeted the legislation as a way to root out fraud, corruption and waste.\n\nThe Inspector General's Office would have subpoena power and, as the bill was written, would have been permitted to keep investigative records secret. The inspector general would have reported directly to the governor and would have been responsible for investigating \u201cthe operations, management and affairs of state agencies,\u201d including employee performance.\n\nThe legislation died in part because of the provision that the records be kept secret, and critics argued such a position was redundant because several agencies have similar positions and the Attorney General can already investigate potential corruption or fraud.\n\nThis AHCCCS case almost certainly will be held up as a reason an inspector general is necessary, even though critics of a Ducey-formed inspector general say this case illustrates why such a position is not necessary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear from day one that I take extremely seriously this administration\u2019s duty and commitment to following the law and protecting Arizona taxpayers,\u201d Ducey said in Wednesday\u2019s statement. \u201cThe fraudulent activities that led to this arrest are unacceptable, appalling, infuriating and have absolutely no place in state government.\"\n\nAgents began serving four search warrants at about 7 a.m. Wednesday at three Phoenix locations and one in Surprise. At least two of the locations were homes in north Phoenix, including one near Seventh Street and Thunderbird Road, which records show Veit owns, and another near Central Avenue and Desert Hills Drive.\n\nThe probe launched after a state employee alerted ACHHHS officials, according to Monica Coury, the agency's assistant director. The allegations immediately prompted an internal investigation by the agency\u2019s inspector general, in conjunction with the AG\u2019s office. When it mushroomed into a full-blown criminal probe, the Attorney General\u2019s Office took over the investigation.\n\nVeit worked at ACHHHS for 27 years, where he most recently oversaw some administrative functions, Coury said. He was responsible for overseeing contracts related to administrative functions, such as facility and office-supply contracts. His annual salary was $99,892.\n\nIn a statement, Brnovich said he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of the special agents and prosecutors in the Healthcare Fraud and Abuse section.\n\n\u201cAllegations of this type of fraud are especially alarming, and the Attorney General\u2019s Office will move swiftly in the prosecution of individuals who violate the public\u2019s trust,\u201d he said.", "dct": "2015-09-02", "source": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/breaking/2015/09/02/ahcccs-employee-arrested-linked-criminal-probe/71574508/"}]}, "BU3550c86f34c64e798ff84758ccbb7f85": {"time": "", "location": "", "participants": "", "numparticipants": "0", "articles": [{"title": "TV channel employee \u2018contacted and helped publicise Muslim Brotherhood\u2019", "dct": "2015-09-07T16:38:19Z", "source": "BU3550c86f34c64e798ff84758ccbb7f85_1", "content": "ABU DHABI // A Kuwaiti media worker made contact with Muslim Brotherhood members to give them TV coverage, the Federal Supreme Court heard. \n\nK\u2009F\u2009A, 46, an Al Bedaya TV channel employee, is accused of helping to publicise the Brotherhood\u2019s UAE arm, a banned organisation. \n\nIt was alleged he received 250,000 Qatari riyals (Dh252,169) from a Qatar charity to finance another TV channel called Hayatona.

Deputy Commissioner Manasi Sahay Thakur said the operation won\u2019t stop until the third labourer Hirday Ram was found. \n\nOperation delayed \n\nIntermittent rainfall and a snag in the heavy boring machine delayed the operation for quite some time, said the DM. The three workers were trapped inside the tunnel after a big rock collapsed on September 12 and massive debris blocked the entrance.

The rescuers flashed the victory sign and screamed in jubilation after the two were brought out. Ram and Tomar too waved to the people as they were taken to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by doctors. They wore goggles to protect their eyes from sudden exposure to light after nine days in darkness. \n\nNDRF Director-General O.P. Singh, who is monitoring the operations from New Delhi, said the biggest challenge for his team was the loose rocks and seepage in the narrow approach to the main part of the tunnel. \n\n\u201cIt was a very risky and long operation. We later used casing pipes to overcome this problem, but it could only be done for a small length. The boys did a great job under challenging circumstances.\u201d \n\nThree NDRF team members, including a sub-inspector, entered the main tunnel, but could not reach the workers as the tunnel was not wide enough and zigzagged. It had to be widened. Further, the water level in the tunnel was rising and pumps were brought in to drain out the water. \n\nMani Ram was first to be taken out after 211 hours and 47 minutes of operations. Satish Tomar emerged eight minutes later. \n\nKeywords: Bilaspur tunnel collapse, two workers rescued \n\nRELATED NEWS \n\nBilaspur tunnel collapse: Two workers rescued after nine daysSeptember 21, 2015 \n\nHC seeks report on trapped workersSeptember 19, 2015 \n\nWorkers trapped in under-construction tunnel in HimachalSeptember 14, 2"}]}, "BU3c5e452697514edb9803c8c50efe1dab": {"time": "2015-09-19", "location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "participants": "", "numparticipants": "1", "articles": [{"title": "St. Tammany Parish jailer fired after misdemeanor DWI arrest Featured", "dct": "2015-09-19T20:29:28Z", "source": "BU3c5e452697514edb9803c8c50efe1dab_1", "content": "A St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office jail employee was fired Saturday (Sept. 19) after he was arrested overnight in Slidell and accused of misdemeanor DWI, the Sheriff's Office said. \n \nKendall Terrell Twillie, of 62354 Willie Mearis Road in Slidell, was booked into Slidell City Jail early Saturday morning, the Sheriff Office said in a press release. \n   Twillie, 23, was off duty when he was arrested in Old Towne Slidell at approximately 2 a.m. \nThe news release said Twillie had not yet finished his academy's training to be a Level I certified law enforcement officer."}, {"title": "St. Tammany Parish jailer fired after misdemeanor DWI arrest", "dct": "2015-09-19T20:23:06Z", "source": "BU3c5e452697514edb9803c8c50efe1dab_2", "content": "A St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office jail employee was fired Saturday (Sept. 19) after he was arrested overnight in Slidell and\u00a0accused of misdemeanor DWI, the Sheriff's Office said.

See Also      One of the most powerful women on Wall Street leads a team that has generated $1 billion in fees this year \u2014 here's her story       Disclosing CEO-worker pay gaps makes no sense for Wall Street banks       Jamie Dimon took a shot at the 'lazy' shareholders that voted against his pay package \u2014 and he was right      \n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says it's OK that CEOs get paid way more than their average employees, and that cutting down on executive compensation wouldn't help eliminate income inequality. \n \nThat's according to Bloomberg's Claire Boston and Hugh Son , who wrote up comments from Dimon at a Detroit event Thursday. \n \n\"It is true that income inequality has kind of gotten worse,\" Dimon said, but \"you can take the compensation of every CEO in America and make it zero and it wouldn't put a dent into it. What really matters is growth.\" \n \nIn August, the US Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule requiring public companies to disclose how much money CEOs earn in comparison to typical employees. \n \nThe idea is to help shareholders make decisions on company performance based on things like employee morale and turnover. \n \nBut as Business Insider reported in August , JPMorgan's CEO-worker pay gap is likely to be one of the most stark of all the major Wall Street firms. The gap is even wider in some other industries . \n \nThe new disclosure will include median worker pay, so we don't yet know what the exact number will be for JPMorgan. \n \nBut we calculated average employee pay at the bank and a handful of others, and compared it to their CEOs' compensations. \n \nBy that measure, Dimon's $27.7 million pay package last year was about 221.7 times that of his average employee, who earned about $124,959 for the year. \n \nDimon officially became a billionaire in June . \n \nAs for the middle class, Dimon reportedly said Thursday:\u00a0\"It's not right to say we're worse off ...

Right? \nLaurent Delhourme \nSome companies prefer to wait and hope discontented workers leave of their volition rather than initiate an action. \n\nNot necessarily. \n\nIt turns out that many workplaces put up with toxic behavior for a variety of reasons. Sometimes the negative employee has talents that no one else in the workplace has and is essential to operations, at least for the time being. \n\nOther times, management is more concerned about the potential legal hassle and expense associated with a firing. Could the negative employee make a claim of age, sex, race or other protected class discrimination? \n\nSome companies prefer to wait and hope discontented workers leave of their volition rather than initiate an action. \n\nYou might be surprised at survey results reported this month by Fierce Inc., a leadership training and development company. The company surveyed 500 employees through its social media and email channels and asked them to identify toxic behaviors in their organizations, \n\nThe largest share, 41 percent, of respondents, ranked negativity as the most detrimental workplace behavior. And 99 percent of the workers surveyed said a negative employee was extremely or somewhat debilitating to morale. \n\nBut for the most part, negativity is allowed. A majority of the respondents said they were unsure if the \u201coverly negative\u201d person should be fired, or they needed more information to decide. \n\nOnly 4 in 10 thought excessive negativity was cause for firing. And three-fourths of them said their organizations were extremely or somewhat tolerant of toxic employees. In fact, some managers believe contrary expression helps promote innovation. \n\nBut, according to Fierce founder Susan Scott, keeping the overly negative employee on board is unhealthy, both to co-workers and the organization. \n\n\u201cThere are always going to be individuals who can\u2019t move past their issues for one reason or another, or can\u2019t get out of the victim mindset,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWhen this occurs, set your organization free and terminate the relationship. It may seem hard at first if their work is solid; however, the havoc they are having on the organization as a whole isn\u2019t worth an individual\u2019s contribution in most cases.\u201d \n\nScott says workplaces should carefully analyze if they\u2019re doing enough to recognize and reward employees.

But there comes a time when even the most efficient entrepreneur must call in help. For most startups and small businesses, hiring workers is the only path to growth.\n\nMany early-stage entrepreneurs outsource work or find contract employees among friends and family. Even if a first employee is a friend of the owner, the business is subject to the laws governing employee-employer relationships as soon as the first paycheck is written. If the business thrives, the first employee will be one of many workers hired in the life of the business.\n\nThat's why it pays to learn the rules and set up the appropriate systems when the first employee is hired. A systematic approach makes it easier to hire future employees and allows the owner to focus on the candidate rather than the rules.\n\nEIN and W-4 \n\nBusiness owners need an employer identification number, or EIN, from the Internal Revenue Service before hiring employees. The EIN is free and can be obtained online at www.irs.gov.\n\nEach employee must fill out a W-4 form detailing how much should be withheld from her paycheck to cover her income taxes. The form can be found on the IRS website.Advertisement Form I-9 and E-Verify \n\nEmployers and employees are required to complete a Form I-9 for each individual \u2014 including citizens and noncitizens \u2014 hired for employment in the United States. The form helps the employer verify the worker's identity and authorization to work by requiring the employee to present government-issued identification such as a social security card or passport. Employers are required to attest to having examined the documents by signing the Form I-9.\n\nEmployers do not file the form with the government, but they are required to retain it for three years after the date of hire or for one year after the employee is terminated.\n\nThe form is also used to verify the worker's immigration or citizenship status with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) at www.uscis.gov/e-verify. While the use of the online E-Verify system isn't mandatory, it's the best way employers can ensure their workforce is legal.\n\nEmployers must use the version of Form I-9 that's in effect at the time of hiring. The current form was revised in 2013. The version date can be found in the lower left-hand corner of the form.\n\nIn New Mexico, employers must also report new employees to a state directory at http://newhire-reporting.com/NM-Newhire/Default.aspx. \n\nWorkers' compensation insurance \n\nUnless the employee is a private domestic worker, a ranch or farm hand or a real estate salesman, employers must secure workers' compensation insurance. Premiums depend on many things, including the type of work and dangers involved, the number of employees and the company's total payroll expense. Low-cost premiums can sometimes be obtained through an industry association. Though not recommended, an employer can opt to self-insure by setting aside money to cover losses.\n\nBusiness owners can learn more by attending WESST's \"Hiring Your First Employee\" workshop on September 23 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the WESST Enterprise Center, 609 Broadway Blvd. NE in Albuquerque.

Law - \"Government\u2019s extension of protections for long-term unemployed, people with criminal records and transgendered people\" Jeff Swiatek of the Indianapolis Star had a long story on Labor Day, reporting:The Second Chance law, passed in 2013, is part of what Indianapolis employment lawyer Michael Blickman refers to as \u201ca new frontier of employee rights\u201d in America. For at least three major categories of employees \u2014 those with criminal records, the long-term unemployed and the transgendered \u2014 new workplace protections have affected the way they are hired, fired and treated on the job.\nHundreds of thousands of Hoosier workers stand to benefit from the new protections, which are coming mostly out of the federal agencies and the Obama administration. Some states are weighing in with protective statutes as well. But the protections also add red tape and legal hurdles for employers as they try to find the best fit for their job openings. Job applications from the long-term unemployed can\u2019t be routinely tossed into the circular file. People with criminal records have greater access to jobs. And the transgendered must have equal bathroom and other work accommodations and can\u2019t be fired over their gender switch. Many employers are feeling angst, wondering what they need to do to adapt. \u201cEmployers have to remain aware of how employee rights are expanding,\u201d said Blickman, an attorney with the large law firm of Ice Miller. \u201cThe law is changing. Courts are more accepting of these cases. Federal agencies such as the EEOC are pursuing actions across the country. And you have an administration very accepting of broadened employee rights.\u201dThe lengthy story then goes into much detail about eact category. Definitely worth reading.

It's the same with people who are working for the government. Not all students who graduated in the Business of Law become lawyers this is the same as not all students who graduated in Medicine become doctors. There's that movie of Tom Hanks who was voted and awarded as a great worker best employee in the workplace. However two College graduates from that place of work contested his job qualification and he was terminated or fired from work. Is that bad? Why an employee is voted for such awards? The answer is because he is a competitive worker and because he's doing his job properly and correctly and he is the best employee in that workplace.\u00a0 Then the company finds out the worker\u00a0 is not a College graduate. What's the verdict? >>\u00a0If that person is working to the \"standard\" required by the workplace do you have to terminate that worker? Of course not! The point of standard is based on MENTALITY of that worker whether he is a College graduate or not. If he is not a College graduate and his mentality is HIGHER than most graduates then that's exception to the rule. Maybe that person is a genius or no diploma or certification required to do the \"required job.\"\nWould you be envious if a 14 year old teacher arrived at your Physics room and announced that he is your High School teacher? What will you do?"}]}, "BU5584fee947af47c6982e56f47843a9d5": {"time": "2015-09", "location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "participants": "", "numparticipants": "1", "articles": [{"title": "Prentiss teacher fired after cameras found in bathroom", "dct": "2015-09-24T18:24:00Z", "source": "BU5584fee947af47c6982e56f47843a9d5_1", "content": "PRENTISS, MS (WDAM) - \n\nA Prentiss teacher has been fired after cameras were found in a restroom at J.E.
