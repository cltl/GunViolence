First, she was out with shingles. \\n \\nThen she had surgery for breast cancer, followed by chemotherapy and regular monitoring. During that time, her supervisor commented several times about Mary's possible retirement. \\n \\nMary eventually did retire\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u201a\\u00ac\\\"and then sued, alleging that she could have continued working if she had been reasonably accommodated. \\n \\nMary explained that the continued cancer treatment made her very tired and that her physical condition made it hard to take the bus to and from work every day. \\n \\nShe had approached her supervisor and specifically asked for a reasonable accommodation: being allowed to work from home. \\n \\nThe supervisor turned down her request without further discussion, informing her that only those with fully satisfactory performance reviews were allowed to telecommute. He never asked how she thought working from home would improve her performance. \\n \\nThat's when, out of leave, Mary retired\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00e2\\u201a\\u00ac\\\"and sought out a lawyer who agreed to take her case. \\n \\nMary's resulting lawsuit alleged that she was constructively discharged when her accommodation request was rejected. Her prime contention was that OPM should at least have discussed whether working at home would have enabled her to continue doing her job. \\n \\nThe court agreed and ordered a trial. \\n \\nIt acknowledged that while Mary may have had performance problems, it was possible that her disability-related fatigue was the underlying cause. If that were the case, allowing her to work from home might have also improved her performance. \\n \\nThe court reasoned that, had OPM engaged in an interactive accommodations process, it might have found an accommodation that would have improved her performance and helped her cope with her disability while performing her job's essential functions. Simply dismissing her request based on presumptions about work and existing work rules could violate the Rehabilitation Act and a jury should decide if that's what happened here. (McIntyre v. Archuleta, No. 2:14-CV-00327, WD PA, 2015) \\n \\nFinal note: Imagine how this may play before a jury. An octogenarian with breast cancer and other disabilities wanted to keep working despite chemotherapy and other treatments but was forced to retire before she felt ready. She made a request to work from home, but her request was turned down without so much as a discussion despite almost three decades of service. \\n \\nBottom line: Always discuss possible accommodations, even if you think it's impossible to accommodate a disability. Document the entire process. \\n \\nAnd remember that the request doesn't have to be formal. A simple \\\"I need help to do my job because of my disability\\\" will do.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BU802dd56ea25f449c9213e36e4744876f": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Alexandria man, woman facing charges in drive-by shooting 16 minutes ago\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-09T21:08:40Z\", \"body\": \"Wilderrious Millage (left) and Jasmine Johnson (Photo: Courtesy/Alexandria Police Department) \\n\\nAn Alexandria man and woman are facing charges after their respective groups exchanged words on Tuesday afternoon, and then allegedly shot at each other from their cars, according to police. \\n\\nThe Alexandria Police Department received a shots fired complaint Tuesday at 12:42 p.m. in the area of Sugar House and Willow Glenn roads.

The resolution will recognize the benefits that worker cooperatives bring to local economies, especially to Oakland, which is a national hub for such enterprises. \\n  \\nOakland will be one of the first cities in the country to integrate tailored support for worker cooperatives into its business assistance center. \\n  \\nThis resolution is a first step toward a broader worker cooperative development strategy. Following this event, the Sustainable Economies Law Center and partner organizations will work with Councilwoman Annie Campbell Washington and others in the city to pass an ordinance that creates meaningful incentives and investment in worker cooperatives. \\n  \\nOakland needs a new kind of economic development that puts people before profits and builds local, sustainable wealth that stays in the community. Too often, cities give tax breaks and other incentives to corporations that are structured to extract wealth from communities and concentrate it in a few hands. \\n \\n\\r\\r \\n  \\nThis problem deeply affects Oakland communities: Income inequality in Oakland ranks as the seventh worst in the country among large cities, according to the Brookings Institution. Economic development as usual is not working. \\n  \\nIn contrast, paving the way for worker-owned businesses promotes shared entrepreneurship and shared, local wealth creation. It fosters democratic workplaces, where all workers have a voice in governance and people predominate over money, not the other way around. \\n  \\nCooperative members typically report higher job satisfaction, receive more leadership and business skills training, and enjoy better wages and benefits than industry standards. \\n  \\nThere are also benefits for business owners who sell their companies to employees, as they can earn a substantial tax benefit and ensure their businesses stay open and rooted in the community. \\n  \\nOakland already provides evidence of the benefits of worker cooperatives. For example, Oakland-based Arizmendi Association bakers make more than double the national median wage for bakers and receive health insurance, paid vacation, and a share of the profits. \\n  \\nA local cooperative development nonprofit, Prospera, reported in 2013 that worker-owners of their green cleaning businesses saw their incomes increase by 158 percent since they joined a coop, and their average initial investments multiplied by 22 times. \\n  \\nCities have begun to take the lead on increasing the visibility of worker cooperatives as more and more municipal governments recognize the benefits of employee-owned businesses and have launched initiatives to support their development. \\n  \\nNew York City led the way, investing $1.2 million and $2.1 million in its fiscal year 2015 and 2016 budgets, respectively, toward local cooperative developers. The city is also considering policy changes to bring down barriers to worker cooperatives and increase their participation in city contracting and procurement. \\n  \\nIn California, the city of Richmond invested $50,000 in worker cooperative development, which led to the creation of a worker cooperative loan fund. \\n  \\nThis resolution will make Oakland the first city in California to codify its support for worker-owned and democratic businesses. \\n  \\nOakland residents can demonstrate their support for a people-centered approach to economic development by coming out in force at 5:30 p.m. next Tuesday at Oakland City Hall, in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, to celebrate the city's recognition of worker cooperatives, and by encouraging the city to take the next steps in its support for the development of equitable, democratic workplaces. \\n  \\nSara Stephens is a staff attorney for Sustainable Economies Law Center in Oakland.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BU3edb944b16b44785a323acef19f48652": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Several dead as severe floods hit Sierra Leone capital\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-17T12:09:27Z\", \"body\": \"by AFP \\nSeptember 17, 2015     Sierra Leone  \\nAt least seven people have died with hundreds made homeless as swathes of Sierra Leone\\u2019s capital were submerged by massive flooding after hours of torrential rain, emergency management officials said Thursday. \\n \\nResidents described how waters destroyed their homes, swept away household goods and damaged vehicles as Freetown, an overcrowded city of 1.2 million, was pounded overnight. \\n \\n\\u201cThe seven corpses were brought in intermittently overnight but we know that more will come,\\u201d Amara Kamara, a mortuary attendant at the city\\u2019s main Connaught Hospital, told AFP. \\n \\n\\u201cThe corpses include two kids aged three-and-a-half and four, as well as a 10-year-old girl.\\u201d \\n \\nIt rains six months of the year in Freetown, one of the world\\u2019s wettest cities, and putrid water from its populated slopes inundate its coastal slums every summer bringing cholera, dysentery and respiratory infections. \\n \\nAt least 20 neighbourhoods were flooded by the five-hour storm, according to a statement from the presidency, which said torrential monsoon rain was expected to continue for at least six days. \\n \\nPolice and soldiers were deployed to the worst-hit areas to maintain law and order, it said, while residents were being urged to stay at home. \\n \\nA doctor told AFP rainwater had inundated six wards in the Connaught, the country\\u2019s largest hospital, forcing patients to be moved to makeshift treatment areas. \\n \\n\\u201cWe were able to contain the situation as we admitted over 100 people for abrasions, shock and hypothermia, while about 40 were treated and discharged,\\u201d a separate medical source told AFP. \\n \\nMohamed Sillah, a worker at the Brookfields National Stadium, said over 600 people had sought refuge by 7:30 am (0730 GMT). \\n \\nThe 45,000-capacity Brookfields, home to the national football team, is\\u00a0one of two Freetown sports grounds where emergency services were telling people to seek refuge. \\n \\nSillah said emergency workers were distributing drinks, bread and foam mattresses with women and children being prioritised.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BUe575ec87ec7f4cdfbf51a418ab6860da": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"MP shocker: Man buried alive after accidentally slipping into pothole\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-21T08:53:21Z\", \"body\": \"in BOLYWOOD / \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tby national / \\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton September 21, 2015 at 8:53 am /  \\nKatni, (Madhya Pradesh):\\u00a0 In an appalling incident, a 45-year-old man was accidentally buried alive while he slipped into a pothole in Madhya Pradesh's Katni District on Sunday. \\n \\nAccording to reports, driver of the dumper and a labourer who had filled the pothole without noticing the man has been arrested. \\n \\n\\n \\nAccording to the police, they received an information on the deceased on Monday morning.

He was often referred to as a \\\"floater\\\" who regularly took on tasks in many different store departments when needed. \\n \\nAllen also apparently had a temper, disliked the store owner and often yelled at other workers.

However, Allen never provided a firm return date despite being asked for one. He did say that he eventually planned to return. At one point, the owner went to Allen's house, offered him a sedentary office position and breaks as needed if he would return to work. Allen never responded to the offer. \\n \\nThe owner then sent Allen a letter informing him that he was being terminated. The letter explained that Allen hadn't provided a return date, mentioned that the company had continued to provide health insurance and stated that Allen had complained about the stress of the job.

He argued that the letter--by mentioning stress and medical bills--was proof that the store owner regarded Allen as disabled and fired him because of his disability. \\n \\nThe case went to a jury trial. The owner testified that he never treated Allen as disabled, but terminated him only when it was clear he wasn't going to provide a return date. He explained that he mentioned health insurance in the letter only to remind Allen how much the company had tried to help him during his illness. \\n \\nThe owner also explained to the jury that Allen hadn't been a perfect employee and that he had been terminated for poor behavior toward subordinates and co-workers. \\n \\nThe jury sided with the store's owner.

Drive Auto. Indus. of Am , which made the joint employment doctrine the law of the Fourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit adopted a \\u201chybrid\\u201d test that embraced both the common law of agency and the economic realities of employment. In setting out a nine-factor test, the Court emphasized that the element of \\u201ccontrol\\u201d remained the principal guidepost for determining whether multiple entities could be considered a plaintiff\\u2019s joint employers. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tWith that emphasis on control in mind, the Court highlighted three factors as the most important: \\n \\n\\r\\n\\t(1) which entity or entities have the power to hire and fire the putative employee is important to determine ultimate control; \\n \\n\\r\\n\\t(2) to what extent the employee is supervised is useful to determine the day-to-day, practical control of the employee; and \\n \\n\\r\\n\\t(3) where and how the work takes place is valuable to determine how similar the work functions of the plaintiff are compared to those of an ordinary employee. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tNow the National Labor Relations Board has weighed in on the joint employer doctrine in its August 27th decision, Browning-Ferris Industries of California, Inc. d/b/a BFI Newby Island Recyclery, 362 NLRB No. 186 (August 27, 2015). While the Butler case addressed whether Drive Automotive and a staffing company were joint employers of worker supplied by the staffing company for the purposes of Title VII employment discrimination, the NLRB addressed whether BFI and a staffing company were joint employers of the staffing company workers whom a Teamsters union sought to represent. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tJust like the Fourth Circuit, the NLRB emphasized the element of control. The NLRB rejected any notion that control must be active, \\u201cdirect and immediate.\\u201d Instead, the NLRB ruled that a reserved authority to control may be enough: \\u201cthe right to control is probative of an employment relationship \\u2013 whether or not that right is exercised.\\u201d The NLRB also stated that control exercised indirectly\\u2014such as through an intermediary staffing agency\\u2014would be sufficient to establish joint employer status. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tCertainly you may never be confronted with a union-related, collective bargaining situation, but this recent NLRB decision together with the recent Fourth Circuit opinion demonstrate a determined judicial and governmental reaction to the rapid expansion of staffing and subcontracting arrangements, contingent employment, and temporary employment through employment placement agencies and temporary help services. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the courts and governmental agencies are confronting and will continue to confront what they perceive as an improper misclassification effort to skirt the laws governing the employer-employee relationship.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BU3f71c8c9191d4dae916d9b567c1ca105": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Finance NM: Hire right the first time\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-03T17:48:03Z\", \"body\": \"ALBUQUERQUE  Entrepreneurs and owners of small businesses are accustomed to doing everything it takes to move their business forward. But there comes a time when even the most efficient entrepreneur must call in help. For most startups and small businesses, hiring workers is the only path to growth.\\n\\nMany early-stage entrepreneurs outsource work or find contract employees among friends and family. Even if a first employee is a friend of the owner, the business is subject to the laws governing employee-employer relationships as soon as the first paycheck is written. If the business thrives, the first employee will be one of many workers hired in the life of the business.\\n\\nThat's why it pays to learn the rules and set up the appropriate systems when the first employee is hired. A systematic approach makes it easier to hire future employees and allows the owner to focus on the candidate rather than the rules.\\n\\nEIN and W-4 \\n\\nBusiness owners need an employer identification number, or EIN, from the Internal Revenue Service before hiring employees. The EIN is free and can be obtained online at www.irs.gov.\\n\\nEach employee must fill out a W-4 form detailing how much should be withheld from her paycheck to cover her income taxes. The form can be found on the IRS website.Advertisement Form I-9 and E-Verify \\n\\nEmployers and employees are required to complete a Form I-9 for each individual \\u2014 including citizens and noncitizens \\u2014 hired for employment in the United States. The form helps the employer verify the worker's identity and authorization to work by requiring the employee to present government-issued identification such as a social security card or passport. Employers are required to attest to having examined the documents by signing the Form I-9.\\n\\nEmployers do not file the form with the government, but they are required to retain it for three years after the date of hire or for one year after the employee is terminated.\\n\\nThe form is also used to verify the worker's immigration or citizenship status with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) at www.uscis.gov/e-verify. While the use of the online E-Verify system isn't mandatory, it's the best way employers can ensure their workforce is legal.\\n\\nEmployers must use the version of Form I-9 that's in effect at the time of hiring. The current form was revised in 2013. The version date can be found in the lower left-hand corner of the form.\\n\\nIn New Mexico, employers must also report new employees to a state directory at http://newhire-reporting.com/NM-Newhire/Default.aspx. \\n\\nWorkers' compensation insurance \\n\\nUnless the employee is a private domestic worker, a ranch or farm hand or a real estate salesman, employers must secure workers' compensation insurance. Premiums depend on many things, including the type of work and dangers involved, the number of employees and the company's total payroll expense. Low-cost premiums can sometimes be obtained through an industry association. Though not recommended, an employer can opt to self-insure by setting aside money to cover losses.\\n\\nBusiness owners can learn more by attending WESST's \\\"Hiring Your First Employee\\\" workshop on September 23 from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the WESST Enterprise Center, 609 Broadway Blvd. NE in Albuquerque.

The estimate of exposure to the worker's body also was lowered significantly.\\nLaflin said the company chose to be especially cautious with its initial response by estimating a high amount of radiation received by the employee. But after examining video and considering results from a medical test, he said, the company revised the amount. He said he expected the federal agency to confirm those results.\\n\\\"This is an instance where an individual had a cognitive error \\u2014 just lost awareness of what they were doing,\\\" Laflin said.\\nThe worker, described by Laflin as a senior technician with more than a decade of experience, was using an instrument to remove cobalt from a container when it became stuck and then unstuck.\\n\\\"It fell to the floor between his legs,\\\" said Victor Dricks, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman, noting the item weighed about 40 pounds. \\\"He maintained control of it, but it came out of the container, and it shouldn't have.

A Florida police union has beef with Arby\\u2019s after an employee allegedly denied service to a police officer. Dade County Police Benevolent Association is calling for a national boycott of the fast food chain after Pembroke Pines Police Sgt. Jennifer Martin was told that an employee didn\\u2019t want to serve her for being a police officer. Arby's Apologizes After Employee Denies Service to Uniformed Police Officer The police report said that a manager told Martin that employee Kenny Davenport didn\\u2019t want to serve her because she\\u2019s a police officer. The manager also reportedly laughed and said that Davenport was allowed to refuse service. Martin said she was worried about the condition of her food and got a refund. Davenport claims that this was all a joke, but the PBA wants the employees involved to be fired. \\u201cIt is beyond comprehension and deeply troubling that a business would deny service to a law enforcement officer just for being a law enforcement officer [\\u2026] This is yet another example of the hostile treatment of our brave men and women simply because they wear a badge. It is unacceptable and warrants much more than an apology. We support our brothers and sisters who wear the badge in Broward County and across the United States.

According to The Washington Times, around 35 of the violations were considered serious by the organization. The more serious violations included electrical equipment issues, damaged crane control boxes and lack of saw guards, according to The New Jersey Business Journal. \\n\\nThe investigation happened because the company notified OSHA that an employee had broken his leg at the plant in March, according to NBC10 Philadelphia. The employee was involved in an accident with crane equipment. It was not reported whether or not the damaged crane control boxes found were directly responsible for the employee's injury, but OSHA officials stated that the violations contributed to the worker's injury.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\\"The number of safety violations found at Aluminum Shapes' plant is completely unacceptable,\\\" Robert Kulick, OSHA's regional administrator in New York, said in a prepared statement reported by The New Jersey Business Journal. \\\"This employer blatantly ignored known safety requirements, causing a preventable worker injury. This company is now paying a hefty price for its negligence. The hazards identified in the investigation should be immediately addressed to prevent future incidents and ensure worker safety.\\\" \\n\\nFor the 44 violations, OSHA proposed a $308,000 fine. The company has a few options now that the inspection is complete and OSHA has reached a verdict. It can pay the fines, contest the citations or set up a meeting with OSHA officials to discuss the issues. \\n\\nSafety compliance isn't a choice \\nMeeting ever-changing safety regulations isn't an easy task, but it is a necessity. Noncompliance will result in hefty fines and injured workers, which can cost a company money, employee loyalty and its public reputation. If a business is perceived poorly by the community and caught up in OSHA inspections and violations, it will likely have a hard time finding companies and customers to work with. While ensuring the entire facility is compliant can be difficult, a company can make sure that its employees are safe and that its facilities are up-to-date with the help of EHS compliance software . By taking a proactive approach, companies can avoid any of the pitfalls that can come with noncompliance, and any inspections from OSHA should go smoothly.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BUe316d43d9aa54503a4116e18e2fffd08": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Former Haggen employee accuses grocer of misleading customers on prices\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-03T13:00:00Z\", \"body\": \"A former Haggen employee is suing the supermarket chain for allegedly retaliating against her for reporting in-store price discrepancies.\\nDebra Sukiasian, a pricing specialist, said she was discriminated against and forced to retire after she reported a mismatch between prices on the shelf and at the cash registers at the Haggen store where she worked in Carpinteria, Calif., according to the lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Santa Barbara County. 2423374_fi_adv_haggen_california_MAM Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times Haggen has been forced to close stores and lay off workers as it struggles with its expansion. Haggen has been forced to close stores and lay off workers as it struggles with its expansion. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)\\nIt's yet another lawsuit in Haggen's troubled expansion. Haggen, a Pacific Northwest chain, bought 146 grocery stores from Albertsons and Safeway after the Federal Trade Commission forced them to be sold as part of a merger. The stores, which include 83 in California, were converted earlier this year.\\nThis week, Haggen filed suit against Albertsons for allegedly sabotaging its store takeovers (Albertsons said the suit was \\\"completely without merit\\\"). Albertsons filed suit against Haggen earlier this summer claiming that Haggen failed to pay millions of dollars for inventory it took over. In the latest lawsuit, Sukiasian said her problems started in June, when the Vons store where she was originally employed was converted to the Haggen brand.\\nOnce the Carpinteria store was changed to Haggen, Sukiasian said many items that were tagged with one price on the shelves ended up scanned as higher prices at the register, the lawsuit said.\\nSukiasian brought up the problem with a Haggen employee responsible for pricing at several Haggen stores, the lawsuit said. She believed that kind of overcharging violated both state and federal laws banning false advertising as well as regulations governing weights and measures, according to the suit. cComments Got something to say?

Law - \\\"Government\\u2019s extension of protections for long-term unemployed, people with criminal records and transgendered people\\\" Jeff Swiatek of the Indianapolis Star had a long story on Labor Day, reporting:The Second Chance law, passed in 2013, is part of what Indianapolis employment lawyer Michael Blickman refers to as \\u201ca new frontier of employee rights\\u201d in America. For at least three major categories of employees \\u2014 those with criminal records, the long-term unemployed and the transgendered \\u2014 new workplace protections have affected the way they are hired, fired and treated on the job.\\nHundreds of thousands of Hoosier workers stand to benefit from the new protections, which are coming mostly out of the federal agencies and the Obama administration. Some states are weighing in with protective statutes as well. But the protections also add red tape and legal hurdles for employers as they try to find the best fit for their job openings. Job applications from the long-term unemployed can\\u2019t be routinely tossed into the circular file. People with criminal records have greater access to jobs. And the transgendered must have equal bathroom and other work accommodations and can\\u2019t be fired over their gender switch. Many employers are feeling angst, wondering what they need to do to adapt. \\u201cEmployers have to remain aware of how employee rights are expanding,\\u201d said Blickman, an attorney with the large law firm of Ice Miller. \\u201cThe law is changing. Courts are more accepting of these cases. Federal agencies such as the EEOC are pursuing actions across the country. And you have an administration very accepting of broadened employee rights.\\u201dThe lengthy story then goes into much detail about eact category. Definitely worth reading.

Even more pervasive and dangerous is cyber-bullying via social media, leading in some cases to its victims committing suicide after being publicly and incessantly humiliated. \\n\\nAt least in our schools, there\\u2019s some good news: The Clark County School District is being more aggressive than ever to try to nip campus bullying in the bud, thanks in part to tougher state laws approved by the 2015 Legislature and signed by the governor. \\n\\nAmong the most important \\u2014 and time-consuming but worth it \\u2014 is the requirement that when a bullying incident is seen by or brought to the attention of a school employee \\u2014 a teacher, a cafeteria worker, an administrator \\u2014 the school must notify the parents of both the alleged aggressor and the victim that same day. The law also requires the matter be investigated within 48 hours. \\n\\nIn other words, bullying won\\u2019t be tolerated, and schools are supposed to jump on it immediately. \\n\\nTo that end, the school district has a website for parents with access to computers \\u2014 ccsd.net/students/bully \\u2014 where bullying incidents can be reported. The person filing the report can remain anonymous. Parents without computer access can call the school. \\n\\nThe website also offers valuable links about bullying, including the growing use of social media in taunting children, that are worth examining. \\n\\nShort of a child telling a parent about a bullying incident, there are telltale signs that your student may be a bully\\u2019s target: the child is withdrawn, avoids groups, plays alone at recess or lunch, is sullen or depressed, has falling grades or simply doesn\\u2019t want to go to school. \\n\\nWith alert teachers and staff trained in how to spot campus bullying, and with the easy reporting system and the promise of a quick response and resolution, there is greater hope that bullying can be reduced. \\n\\nOur concern, though, is that the promise to notify parents promptly when bullying is claimed and quickly launch an investigation will take time away from school employees who already have full plates. As a result, incidents of students being even just subtly aggressive toward others may be dismissed simply as \\u201ckids being kids\\u201d and not be pursued. In a no-tolerance environment, that would be a bad choice, taking us back to square one. \\n\\nThe responsibility of thwarting bullies extends beyond educators.

Kunda had left Nirupa when latter was barely a few months old at Pandita Ramabai Mukti Mission's shelter-and-adoption home in Kedgaon near Pune where the little girl was born in 1973. Readying for a second marriage after an abrupt widowhood, Kunda and her family chose to keep Nirupa's birth a secret that had remained intact so far. This centre gave Nirupa in adoption to a Swedish couple in 1976.\\n\\nEmotions flowed when Nirupa touched the face of her mother, now in her late 60s, seated on a charpoy in the ramshackle room in a locality where mostly the poor from Buddhist community lived. While Nirupa was struggling to hold back tears, her biological mother Kunda was bore a cautious look unable to react at sudden appearance of a daughter whose existence she had never disclosed to her present family.\\n\\n\\\"Hi Mom!' said Nirupa in a hushed voice brushing Kunda's face. Though she is known as Nilakshi Elizabeth in back home, she now wants to switch to 'Nirupa' permanently which was the name her biological mother gave her. Nirupa was helped by activists Arun Dohle and Anjali Pawar of Brussels-based NGO, Against Child Trafficking, to help her trace her roots in Amravati and Murtizapur. After a prolonged period of ill-treatment at the hands of her adoptive mother, for whom taking her into adoption was just a fad after three children of her own, Nirupa seemed to be trying to find some genuine love from Kunda.\\n\\n\\\"My mother is the most beautiful and strong person I have ever met,\\\" said Nirupa, a store employee in Sweden. Kunda, till date, has remained clueless why her first husband, from whom Nirupa was born, had consumed poison while returning home from farmland. Her marriage was barely two-and-half years old then. She returned to her father's place near Murtizapur where she realized she was pregnant. Kunda's elder sister Anupama (name changed) had taken her to the Mukti Mission centre where she gave birth to Nirupa on September 16 in 1973. After a few months, Kunda left the centre and the child with a signature on a document whose content she was unaware of.\\n\\nKunda, after meeting her daughter, made a fleeting gesture of her hand to indicate Nirupa was a foot long when she had last seen her, evading notice of others in the room in the family of her second husband from whom she had another three children. \\\"I was shattered while leaving her but was helpless,\\\" she said. The mother-daughter tried to bond, with Pune-based activist Anjali playing the interpreter, while going to Murtizapur where Kunda's brother stayed. This brother was among the few who knew of Kunda's secret daughter.\\n\\nAnjali said Nirupa broke down while bidding mother adieu. \\\"It was heartening to see mother counselling daughter to face tough situations strongly. Though being more frail of the two, mother still provided Nirupa with emotional strength,\\\" said Anjali who has helped almost 40 adoptees meet their biological parents.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BUc0fd760c6f9d4a48be79f0fad7a6fdd3": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Liverpool John Lennon Airport employee hit by a buggy, hospitalized\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-16T22:01:45Z\", \"body\": \"LIVERPOOL, England - An airport worker was in hospital this evening after being hit by a buggy.\\r\\nThe accident happened in the early hours of this morning at Liverpool John Lennon Airport.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nread more\\r\\n\\u2026 \\r \\nLIVERPOOL, England - An airport worker was in hospital this evening after being hit by a buggy. \\n\\nThe accident happened in the early hours of this morning at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. \\n\\nThe worker, an employee of airport subcontractor OCS, was hit by a specialist vehicle used to transport injured and disabled people around the terminal. \\n\\nParamedics had to be called and the man was taken to hospital by the North West Ambulance Service. \\n\\nIt is not yet known how badly he was hurt, but the employee is still in hospital this evening being treated for his injuries. \\n\\nA spokesman for Liverpool John Lennon Airport said: \\u201cWe can confirm that there was an incident involving an employee of OCS, who provides assistance for passengers with reduced mobility here at Liverpool John Lennon Airport, and one of their vehicles in the early hours of this morning. \\n\\n\\u201cParamedics attended the incident and the individual was subsequently taken to hospital, however we are unaware of the extent of the individual\\u2019s injuries. \\n\\n\\u201cThe incident will be the subject of an internal investigation by OCS. \\n\\n\\u201d \\n\\nPassengers in the airport terminal were forced to wait over an hour and a half for their lugga\\u2026\"}]}", "incinitstr:BU2b0e170e88f945f3af8b2ac48c4f27cf": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"AZ official pleads not guilty in Medicaid theft\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-17T20:56:44Z\", \"body\": \"A former state employee who oversaw purchasing at Arizona's Medicaid program has pleaded not guilty to charges that he stole at least $1.5 million from the program. \\n Maricopa County Superior Court officials said 63-year-old Michael Veit of Phoenix entered his plea Thursday.  \\nA co-defendant, 67-year-old Michael Joseph Cameron, also pleaded not guilty on Thursday. \\n \\nVeit and Cameron face numerous counts of such crimes as conspiracy, money laundering, trafficking in stolen property, theft and fraudulent schemes. \\n \\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office launched a criminal investigation after an Inspector General investigation found what appeared to be improper business practices at the Medicaid program, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. \\n \\nVeit was fired on Aug. 18 and arrested Sept. 2.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BU88c0fde64d32479a948fe681f25b2d7e": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Taylor Swift sued for false groping accusation\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-12T16:59:58Z\", \"body\": \"Singer Taylor Swift has reportedly been sued by former radio host David Mueller after he was wrongly accused of inappropriately touching the popstar during a photo session at the Pepsi Center. \\n \\nAccording to The Denver Post newspaper the lawsuit was filed on Thursday.

While initial review indicates the allegedly improper work was limited to one employee and did not present a significant and immediate public health risk, it raises questions about the reliability of some water testing data used by MDH\\u2019s Environmental Health Division and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for projects going back to at least May 2013. In response, MDH removed the employee from lab duties and is bringing in external reviewers to conduct a thorough investigation. The initial focus is on 2,200 analyses conducted by the employee between May 2013 and May 2015. That is approximately 0.7 percent of the 325,000 total analyses performed during that time by the employee\\u2019s section of the lab. The department is reprocessing the employee\\u2019s sample analyses to ensure that the results are accurate and reliable. According to MDH Commissioner Ed Ehlinger, top priority will be given to reprocessing analyses associated with public water systems. The department has grouped projects and sites with suspect results into tiers based on the potential impact of flawed results. Those results considered most sensitive will be reanalyzed first. The top-priority group includes five public water supply systems (Edina, St. Louis Park, Spring Park, Kasota, and Brooklyn Center), several private drinking wells in Baytown Township and adjacent areas of Washington County, and private wells near the Lindala Sanitary Landfill site in Wright County. \\u201cWe are concerned about this situation and we are making every effort \\u2013 including contracting for outside laboratory assistance \\u2013 to reanalyze the work as quickly as possible,\\u201d Commissioner Ehlinger said. \\u201cWe have an obligation to provide sound, science-based information to our partners and the public.\\u201d The alleged misconduct involved analysis of drinking water and untreated groundwater and surface water. The samples were run to look for volatile organic compounds, and gasoline and diesel products. The evidence indicates the employee did not follow proper procedures to verify instrument calibration, and avoided quality control steps that may have generated weaker, less defensible results. No motive has been identified. MDH is taking multiple steps to prevent future misconduct. This includes external audits, closer supervision of analysts, and more robust internal review processes. The department will also be reviewing training, practices and procedures to determine what other changes may be warranted. More information is available on the MDH website at www.health.state.mn.us and updates will be provided as available. -MDH- Media inquiries: Michael Schommer, MDH Communications, 651-201-4998 - ------\"}]}", "incinitstr:BUb9487e3f87e14629a3ee3d81e1e0e475": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Grocery store worker slashed across face in beef about veggies\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-06T15:56:48Z\", \"body\": \"A Manhattan supermarket worker was slashed in the face Sunday morning by a drunken coworker during an argument over how the suspect was unpacking vegetables, cops and witnesses said.\\n\\nThe workers were in the basement of the Fine Fare grocery store in East Harlem when the bloody dispute erupted around 8:30 a.m., witnesses and officials said.\\n\\n\\u201cThey started to argue.

Nicholas A. Clark, 36, who listed an address in the 1000 block of Smith Road, pleaded guilty Tuesday before Judge Tom Difanis to unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. Clark was arrested April 30 in connection with shots that were fired three days earlier outside a home in the 800 block of North Prospect Avenue, Champaign. Police said at the time that someone had fired numerous shots at the house but no people were hit or injured. Police learned that Clark arrived in a car, got out and argued outside with a man who lived on that block. He then fired shots which hit a house, police said. Assistant State's Attorney Scott Larson said Clark was on federal parole for a weapons violation at the time of his arrest. Court records show he had other convictions for possession of cannabis, delivery of a controlled substance, obstructing justice, forgery, and domestic battery. In exchange for his plea to possessing the weapon, Larson dismissed more serious charges alleging Clark fired the gun. \\\"We felt this was the count we could prove,\\\" Larson said of the negotiated plea agreement. At the time of Clark's arrest, police said his alleged victim was not very helpful to their investigation. Clark was given credit for 146 days already served in the county jail.

The fast food joint came under fire on Twitter after news of the employee\\u2019s refusal to serve the officers circulated.  Whataburger immediately responded on social media. \\n \\n\\u201cWe would never condone this action and this is completely unacceptable. We are working hard to address this as soon as possible.\\u201d Indeed, by this morning at 9 AM the business tweeted that the employee was off the payroll and that the two officers who were refused service have been asked back so that Whataburger can \\u201cmake this right.\\u201d \\n \\nGood Cop, Bad Cop \\n \\nThe officers\\u2019 mixed responses, however, show how difficult it will be for the company to correct the perception \\u2014  created by a single employee acting independently \\u2014 that Whataburger is anti-police. \\n \\nOfficer Michael Magovern told Fox4 News that he still loves Whataburger and doesn\\u2019t want to throw the company \\u201cunder the bus\\u201d (although he gladly enjoyed a meal at Dairy Queen after the incident). He believes this is a problem with one location or one employee, and in his thirty years serving the public as a firefighter and police officer, \\u201cthis is the first time this has ever happened to me.\\u201d \\n \\nMagovern thought the man behind the Whataburger counter was joking when he said, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t serve police officers.\\u201d But Officer Cameron Beckham was less inclined to take the incident in stride, saying, \\u201cIt really strikes a nerve personally and professionally because maybe he\\u2019s joking or maybe he\\u2019s not, but how do we trust that individual or that company to cook anyone\\u2019s food now?\\u201d \\n \\nWe, the Tweeple \\n \\nPeople on twitter responded more positively, however, with many showing their support for the burger company and lauding its quick response on social media. ME Harpahl wrote, \\u201c@Whataburger Awesome job! Will take the family to my local Whataburger today to honor a great Texas company! Thank you Whataburger!\\u201d \\n \\nStill, not everyone was pleased and some tweeted that Whataburger was not doing enough. The company is sticking to its story, however, repeating the phrases \\u201capologize\\u201d and \\u201cmake it right\\u201d in most of its exchanges. \\n \\nHow to Handle Rogue Employees \\n \\nSo what should you do if you find yourself in Whataburger\\u2019s very awkward position, with your hard work and stellar reputation sullied by the carelessness of a single employee? Follow the fast food company\\u2019s lead. \\n \\nFirst, be careful what you tweet . People will demand engagement, statements, and explanations. Do apologize but do not say anything certain until you have a plan for finding out what happened. Make sure the company\\u2019s response is unified, consistent, and coming from an appropriate person. \\n \\nTry not to get caught up in the urgency of the moment. Even an emergency PR situation benefits from a little planning \\u2014 you may not have much time to mull it over, but do carefully consider your words before speaking as you may risk more blunders.

Parks, who was appointed in 2008 and fired five years later, sued the city and Mayor George Heartwell alleging that she was fired because of the city's \\\"pattern and practice of eliminating women and minorities from Defendant's workforce,\\\" the lawsuit said. Parks is the granddaughter of Grand Rapids' first African-American mayor, the late Rev. Lyman S. Parks. Her annual salary was around $95,000. The city contended that her work performance led to her firing. Her position is one of four that serves at the will of the City Commission, which makes the appointments. \\\"Ms. Parks' performance evaluations were negative beginning at least as early as the evaluation of 2011,\\\" attorney Laura Amtsbuechler, representing the city, said in her motion to dismiss the case. She said two city commissioners began working with her to improve her performance and suggested that she seek guidance from outside advisers and other appointed officials. She did not, the city said. In September 2013, after a third year of unsatisfactory evaluations, she was offered the opportunity to resign with six months of severance pay or take another job with the city, Amtsbuechler said.

For many companies the main objective for their leaders in developing health programs and strategies is the desire to be considered as a responsible employer while focusing on more precautionary actions to reduce healthcare and disability spending.      ?While it is certainly promising that more companies are developing health programs or are planning to do so in the future it is equally discouraging to notice that many of them do not recognize the intrinsic benefits of such strategies that can lead to increased employee productivity by managing absenteeism, stress and general performance. All of these beneficial aspects have been documented to have a positive impact on a business? results; therefore one can only wonder why companies are promoting health programs if they cannot make the connection between employee wellbeing and corporate development? stated Josef Neidhardt, Senior Development and Strategy Manager at Ephraim Global.   The research also shows that a significant part of employees (38%) have linked health issues to decreased productivity, with a higher occupational engagement rate amongst individuals that have described their health as being good compared to peers that have stated that they are regularly facing health related problems. On the other hand it would seem that managers place much more importance on occupational involvement (62%) rather than health (40%), even though health initiatives are becoming increasingly popular with business environments. ?Savvy business leaders are aware that the influence of health programs goes beyond basic medical and disability expenditures and recognize the negative impact brought forth by health related issues and reduced productivity. In order to extract more value from such programs and strategies employers should focus more on their intrinsic social aspects, supporting a culture of health within their respective office environments and facilitating employee reintegration, thus leading to a mutually beneficial relationship between both managers and their employees.? concluded Mr. Josef Neidhardt.

This case has implications for all employers conducting drug tests in a unionized setting.\\u00a0 \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tIn the case, a manager found that a route driver \\u201creeked of the smell of marijuana\\u201d and had glassy, bloodshot eyes. The manager ordered the employee to take a reasonable suspicion drug test, and the employee requested the presence of a union shop steward. The employee was able to reach a union shop steward by phone but was unable to find anyone immediately available to accompany him to the test. The employer required that the employee immediately submit to the test anyway. When the employee refused, the employer discharged him for \\u201crefusal to submit to substance abuse testing based on reasonable suspicion.\\u201d \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tThe NLRB has previously found that employees have the right to union representation during drug tests ( Ralphs Grocery Co. , 361 NLRB No. 9 (2014)) and that employers must provide employees with a reasonable time to obtain such representation ( Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware , 264 NLRB No. 76, 541, 542 (1982)). The Manhattan Beer Distributors case breaks new ground in that it makes clear that the physical presence of a union representative is required to actively assist the employee in a drug testing situation.\\u00a0 \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tThis case is important for employers seeking to ensure that the safety and efficacy of their workplaces are not compromised by alcohol and drug use. The NLRB\\u2019s decision\\u2014by allowing employees to delay drug and alcohol tests while waiting for a union representative\\u2014is all the more important because alcohol and drugs can dissipate quickly from the body and employees may be able to dilute their drug and alcohol testing samples to levels that are below laboratory cutoffs by consuming water. If an employer is forced to wait while an employee secures the physical presence of a union representative for the employee\\u2019s reasonable suspicion drug or alcohol test, the employer should ensure that the employee is kept under observation and that his or her water or adulterant consumption is monitored. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tIn the Manhattan Beer Distributors case,\\u00a0the employer allowed the employee to leave the office to contact his union representative and offered to allow the employee to drive himself to the drug testing lab. Both decisions allowed the potentially intoxicated employee an opportunity to drink water or defraud the drug test. Of course, allowing a potentially intoxicated employee to drive to a drug lab also creates a safety concern. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tNote that if an employer cannot secure a union representative or cannot reasonably and lawfully prevent the employee from access to water, the employer is free to take disciplinary action without a drug or alcohol test. As the NLRB stated, \\n \\n\\r\\n\\twhere an employee requests union representation before participating in a disciplinary investigation [such as a drug or alcohol test], the employer has three clearly established options:\\u00a0 (1) grant the employee\\u2019s request; (2) give the employee the option of proceeding without representation; or (3) discontinue the interview and make a disciplinary decision based on the information it has available. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tIn this case, the employer would have been better off either allowing the employee a reasonable time to secure union representation (while preventing him from diluting or adulterating his sample) or taking action against the employee for his signs of intoxication alone rather than requiring the employee submit to the drug test without union representation.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BU731868f1e9ab4b0fb12143eec32e65cb": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Billionaire JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon says there\\u2019s no point in slashing CEO pay (JPM)\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-17T20:47:04Z\", \"body\": \"Mario Tama/GettyJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\\tSee Also One of the most powerful women on Wall Street leads a team that has generated $1 billion in fees this year \\u2014 here's her story Disclosing CEO-worker pay gaps makes no sense for Wall Street banks Jamie Dimon took a shot at the 'lazy' shareholders that voted against his pay package \\u2014 and he was right JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says it's okay that CEOs get paid way more than their average employees, and that cutting down on executive compensation wouldn't help eliminate income inequality.

In late July, Stephanie Barnett, the former director of the county\\u2019s internal services division, won an award of $306,400, mostly in back pay damages. Jurors during a weeklong trial determined Montrose County violated the law in firing her when she requested to work part time in May 2013. Barnett was fired seven days after meeting with her former boss, Montrose\\u2019s former county manager, Roy \\u201cRick\\u201d Eckert. Barnett\\u2019s total award now is $771,411 and she and her attorneys plan to seek attorney costs and litigation costs that could reach a total of $1 million, said one of her attorneys, Nick Mayle with the law firm Killian, Davis, Richter & Mayle in Grand Junction. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a significant award and I think it reflects that the jury and judge found that Ms. Barnett was subject to a lot of discrimination,\\u201d he said. Mayle said the most recent ruling on Aug. 28 by U.S. District Court Judge James Parker was an award for Barnett\\u2019s front pay, or an estimated amount of income she lost from the end of her trial into the future. Barnett\\u2019s prior award by a jury of 12 residents was for back pay, or the amount of money she lost from the time of getting fired to the date of trial. According to the complaint, Eckert told Barnett her division would be dissolved because of \\u201cbudgetary restraints\\u201d at the county. However, she was the only employee to lose her job and Barnett\\u2019s duties were taken over by another person. Montrose County has said in a statement that they \\u201cconsider this case to be completely without merit.\\u201d Montrose County has the option to file an appeal of both monetary awards.

The FLSA is the federal law commonly known for minimum wage, overtime pay and related recordkeeping requirements. The FLSA's requirements and wage mandates apply only to employees, not to independent contractors. Because they do not, companies using independent contractors have much lower administrative and labor costs. In July 2015, claiming it continues to receive numerous complaints about employees misclassified as independent contractors, the DOL issued additional guidance regarding the standards for determining who is an employee under the FLSA. As the DOL plainly concluded in its guidance memo: \\\"[M]ost workers are employees under the FLSA's broad definitions.\\\" The guidance memo strongly favors classifying workers as employees, and it creates a huge hurdle for any business classifying its workers as independent contractors. You can read the full guidance memo here . \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tThe classification of workers is a complicated subject that often boils down to: (i) what records a company is required to keep for each worker; and (ii) whether each worker is overtime-eligible. If a worker is classified as an employee, the answers are: (i) all timekeeping, payroll and wage records; and (ii) yes, unless the employee is exempt. If a worker is classified as an independent contractor, the answers are (i) none; and (ii) no. Knowing this, it is easy to see why a company would prefer to classify its workers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tClassification issues have recently gone viral thanks to on-demand start-up companies such as Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, and until recently, Homejoy. These companies put access to local, on-demand services literally at your fingertips (as most are run on a smartphone app). To do this, they rely on an army of workers, almost all of whom are classified as independent contractors. The problem? The army of workers may be misclassified, and under the DOL's new guidance, they likely are. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tWhen workers believe they are misclassified, they typically file class action lawsuits. These lawsuits can include tens of thousands of workers. Uber, for example, is currently defending a misclassification lawsuit in California. Just this month, the judge expanded the lawsuit to include 160,000 other drivers. Not only are these lawsuits costly to defend, but if they are successful, they can easily put a company out of business. We recently say this with Homejoy. Homejoy was a global, on-demand house cleaning app. It was in 35 U.S. cities and five other countries. After it was hit with multiple misclassification lawsuits, between defense costs and potential liability, Homejoy shut down completely. \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tOn the heels of the DOL's guidance memo, we expect to see an uptick in misclassification lawsuits across all industries and markets. While the guidance did not change the law, it did provide a roadmap for any worker or attorney looking to file a lawsuit. If you employ independent contractors and have concerns about whether your employees are misclassified, asking these three questions is a good place to start: \\n \\r\\n\\t\\tIf you use both independent contractors and employees, are employees performing essentially the same duties as the independent contractors? \\r \\r\\n\\t\\tDo your independent contractors report to the office or a specific location at the start or end of each shift? \\r \\r\\n\\t\\tDo you have the ability to control how your independent contractors perform their duties? \\r \\n\\r\\n\\tIf you answered \\\"yes\\\" to any one of these questions, you may have misclassified workers.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BUfa8e50d8596a47cea627a955cfa2ecad": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"VA illegally fired clerk, whistleblower wa...\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-09T00:53:30Z\", \"body\": \"The VA illegally fired a disabled Army vet who\\u2019d complained to Congress about the department\\u2019s bungling treatment of his case, the government\\u2019s own whistleblower watchdog said in a new report Tuesday that highlights the department\\u2019s questionable treatment of those who seek to expose its problems. \\n\\nBradie Frink faced a series of retaliations, including eventually being fired from his job as a time clerk at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs office, after he complained to Sen.

The will of the highest court in the country seemingly meant nothing to her, and though it was an aggressive, and downright mean, act to perpetrate against a couple that simply wanted to get married (at its heart, Ms. Davis, that\\u2019s what you\\u2019re doing, under the guise of religion), I still decided to let her nonsense play out. Let\\u2019s be reasonable, something that people in support of Ms. Davis and \\u201creligious freedom\\u201d seem incapable of being. Kim Davis has been married four times. She\\u2019s been divorced three times. If we\\u2019re going to go by \\u2018God\\u2019s law\\u2019 then Ms. Davis is already in for a hellaciously hot future. Targeting innocent gay and lesbian couples who want only to celebrate their love (as she got to do four times already) is not endearing her to anyone\\u2019s God. I thought for sure the loonies would see that much, but they and Ms. Davis herself have proven capable of stupidity beyond my wildest imagination. Even then I joked a bit, saying that I didn\\u2019t understand how someone so badly in need of a makeover could alienate so many gay men. But today, after her umpteenth appeal was denied, and after she still refused to do her damn job and issue marriage licenses, I\\u2019m just pissed. I work for the government too, but if I behaved the way she did I\\u2019d be disciplined big time. Her job is to issue marriage licenses, not administer a religious sacrament. There is a distinct separation of church and state written into the constitution, and it\\u2019s there for precisely this reason. Let\\u2019s say, for example, that my religion is fashion. Not a far-fetched example, quite frankly. And let\\u2019s say that I\\u2019m vociferously against Crocs and cargo shorts, that I think anyone who wears them is going to hell, and that I don\\u2019t want to be affiliated with them in any way. As much as I\\u2019d like to not help them, if my job calls upon me to provide information that they need to do their job, if I have to help them or support them in the course of the day, as a state worker I have to do so. I can\\u2019t refuse because I don\\u2019t believe in Crocs or cargo shorts. Or better yet, let\\u2019s say that I don\\u2019t believe in working a full day. My beliefs are that I need a siesta from noon to five, and after that I need a period to relax and meditate. It goes directly against the hours that I\\u2019m supposed to work, but hey, those are my beliefs and everyone who knows me will most definitely attest to this. Can I just leave my job at noon based on these staunchly-held beliefs? That\\u2019s exactly what Ms. Davis is doing right now. If it were anyone else, they\\u2019d be disciplined, if not fired. How many times does she need to be instructed to uphold the law of the country and do her job as a government employee? I think she\\u2019s had her chance. Either do your job, or resign.

The WAGE Act is a positive step forward, addressing the shortcomings of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in the areas of workers protections and penalties for employers that violate workers' rights. \\n\\nThe legislation would amend the NLRA to further strengthen protections for both union and non-union workers by increasing remedies for workers and imposing new penalties for employers who act illegally.

Hoffa . \\\"The WAGE Act offers real reform to our current laws and provides worker protections through significant penalties that will discourage employers from acting illegally. It is long past time to bring our labor laws into the 21 st century.\\\" \\n\\nHighlights of the proposed changes to the NLRA through the WAGE Act include: \\nTripling backpay for workers who are illegally fired or retaliated against; Establishing civil penalties up to $50,000 for employers who commit unfair labor practices; Providing for federal court injunctions to immediately return fired workers to their jobs; Establishing NLRB authority to impose penalties on officers & directors of employer violators; Establishing NLRB authority to issue a bargaining order when it finds an employer prevented a free and fair election. \\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.4 million hardworking men and women throughout the United States , Canada and Puerto Rico .

You\\u2019re likely one of the millions of Americans living in one of 25 Right to Work states. \\n\\nYou might not know it from Right to Work opponents\\u2019 heated rhetoric, but Right to Work laws aren\\u2019t hard to understand. They simply ensure that no employee can be forced to join or pay dues to a union. Not only does this enshrine workplace choice and protect employee freedom, it also brings a number of economic benefits to your home state. \\n\\nAccording to data compiled by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research, Right to Work states have enjoyed higher private-sector job growth and larger wage increases over the past decade than their forced-unionism counterparts. No only that, but after adjusting for states\\u2019 differing costs of living, residents in Right to Work states enjoy more disposable income than their non-Right to Work neighbors. \\n\\nThe connection between Right to Work laws and better economic performance shouldn\\u2019t come as much of a surprise. Business experts consistently rank the presence of Right to Work laws as one of the most important factors companies consider when deciding where to expand or relocate their facilities where they will create new jobs. \\n\\nRight to Work laws also encourage unions to be more flexible and responsive in the workplace. Where workers can\\u2019t be forced to join or pay dues, union officials have to work harder to retain employee support. This encourages union officials to put workers\\u2019 interests first, instead of simply looking out for their own privileges or pushing for policies that are out of step with the rank-and-file. \\n\\nRight to Work laws make plenty of economic sense, but protecting employee freedom has always been their most important feature. No worker should be forced to join or pay money to an organization he or she has no interest in supporting. Right to Work laws do nothing to impede employees from voluntarily joining or paying dues to a union; they simply ensure that no worker can be forced to contribute just to keep a job. \\n \\nIf you\\u2019re still unsure where you stand on the Right to Work issue, ask yourself a simple question: Why shouldn\\u2019t union officials play by the same rules as any other private organization? A labor union that enjoys genuine employee support will continue to thrive with funding from members\\u2019 voluntary contributions. A union that has alienated the rank-and-file or outlived its usefulness will adapt quickly or whither on the vine. \\n\\nAcross the country, churches, civic associations, and thousands of other private organizations thrive on voluntarism. Many unions have followed their example and continue to prosper in Right to Work states across the country. Meanwhile, all Right to Work residents \\u2013 non-union and union alike \\u2013 benefit from more jobs and higher wages. \\n\\nWorkplace choice, employee freedom, and better economic performance are part and parcel of the Right to Work package. So what\\u2019s not to like?

American employers often do not realize that offer letters\\u2014 no matter how much \\u201cat-will\\u201d language is included in them\\u2014may constitute employment contracts, albeit without all the bells and whistles that should be included to protect the company.\\u00a0Moreover, once an offer letter is signed, it may be too late to make changes. \\u00a0 \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tIn fact, the inclusion of \\u201cat-will\\u201d or \\u201cthis-is-not-a-contract\\u201d language in non-U.S. employment contracts and policies has often been used to invalidate those terms that are unfavorable to employees. After all, if the employer does not recognize an instrument as a contract, why should the employee abide by his or her so-called obligations? And beware: \\u201cat-will\\u201d language is often perceived as evidence of a U.S. employer\\u2019s ignorance of and indifference to local law, which is never helpful in the event of a labor dispute. \\u00a0 \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tRather than shying away from full-blown local employment contracts and \\u201cmaking do\\u201d with U.S.-style documents, employers should embrace the opportunity to control risks and avoid common pitfalls. Below are just a few examples of international differences that can end up being costly or burdensome\\u2014or both\\u2014for employers. \\n \\n\\r Canada: Termination Entitlements \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tIn Canada, a well-drafted contract could mean the difference between paying a couple months\\u2019 severance or a couple years\\u2019 worth! If you have employees in Canada in any province other than in Quebec, you can control termination costs through some very simple language added to their employment contracts. But make sure the contract is signed before the employee starts working;\\u00a0if not, you will be at the mercy of the very generous common-law entitlements that have developed over the years, which may require you to provide up to 24 months of notice\\u2014or pay in lieu of notice\\u2014to dismissed employees. \\u00a0 \\n \\n\\r France: No ncompetition Agreements \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tHow would you like to pay your employee to compete with you?\\u00a0Noncompetition agreements must be very precisely drafted in order to be enforced in a French court. If you use a typical U.S.-style noncompetition agreement that does not compensate the employee in exchange for his or her agreement not to compete, French courts will likely release the employee from the noncompetition agreement and require you to continue paying the employee on a monthly basis after his or her employment is terminated. Minimum payments are usually 33 percent of an employee\\u2019s prior remuneration package per month for the duration of the noncompete term and may reach 60 percent depending on the applicable collective bargaining agreement.\\u00a0 \\n \\n\\r Germany and South Korea: Data Privacy \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tIn Germany and South Korea, employers can be hamstrung by data-privacy rules when managing employee information.\\u00a0The laws of each of these countries require employers to include very specific data privacy language in contracts. Failure to include such language may result in the company being unable to transfer and use its employees\\u2019 information in the ordinary course of business. The situation is similar throughout the countries of the European Union in varying degrees. \\n \\n\\r Conclusion \\n \\n\\r\\n\\tUnlike the United States where the \\u201cat-will\\u201d regime is standard, employers abroad do not need to be wary of providing employees in other countries with rights by providing them with a contract.\\u00a0These employees already have rights!\\u00a0Now it is time for you to protect yours.\"}]}", "incinitstr:BUb52e9866bc464098a2545c7097af23a3": "{\"estimated_location\": \"\", \"estimated_incident_date\": \"\", \"articles\": [{\"title\": \"Vanguard Group Fires Whistleblower Who Told TheStreet About Flaws in Customer Security\", \"dct\": \"2015-09-18T17:12:15Z\", \"body\": \"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The Vanguard Group, the world's largest mutual fund company, has fired a whistleblower who shared information with TheStreet about deficiencies in the company's customer account security. \\n \\nAccording to the public database of stockbroker records kept by The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Karen Brock, a Client Relationship Administrator in Vanguard's Scottsdale, Arizona office, is no longer employed by Vanguard or registered as a broker. \\n \\nFinra's public records said nothing about the reason for Brock's termination.

Friday's decision upheld that dismissal. \\n \\nSteven Rovner, a lawyer for Munroe, said his client may ask the entire 3rd Circuit to review the case. \\\"We believe the courts are not right on this issue, and we're still fighting for Natalie and her constitutional rights,\\\" he said in an interview. \\n \\nLawyers for the Central Bucks School District, located north of Philadelphia, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \\n \\nCircuit Judge Thomas Ambro dissented, finding \\\"more than enough evidence\\\" suggesting that Munroe was fired over the blog and her many interviews with the media. \\n \\n\\\"Too many signs suggest this was all a set-up that a jury needs to sort out,\\\" he wrote. \\n \\nThe case is Munroe v. Central Bucks School District et al, 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-3509. \\n \\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)\"}]}"}
