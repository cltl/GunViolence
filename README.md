# LongTailQATask

This repository contains the code for the pilot of the task **Counting Events and Participants within Highly Ambiguous Data covering a very long tail** proposed to SemEval 2018. The pilot is described in *Section 7* of our proposal.

Following the conceptual division in the proposal text, the task implementation is divided into two parts: 

1) Preparation of the data described in *Section 4.1*
2) Question creation as described in *Section 5.3*
