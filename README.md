# LongTailQATask

This repository contains the code for the pilot of the task **Counting Events and Participants within Highly Ambiguous Data covering a very long tail** proposed to SemEval 2018. The pilot is described in *Section 7* of our proposal.

Following the conceptual division in the proposal text, the task implementation is divided into two parts: 

1) **EventRegistries** contains the data preparation scripts and data (described in *Section 4.1* of the proposal)
2) **QuestionCreation** creates questions based on this data and generates question stats (as described in *Section 5.3*)

### 1) EventRegistries

### 2) QuestionCreation
