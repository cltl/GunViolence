The status of the gunman is unknown. (more)\nThe incident began at about 9:56 p.m. CT on Saturday when agents with the Fugitive Task Force of the U.S. Marshal Service attempted to contact a suspect who was believed to be located at the Country Club motel.\n\"Unknown person(s) and the Task Force exchanged gunfire outside the motel and a fire occurred during these events,\" said Lt. Colleen Stuart of the Topeka Police Department. Local journalists who responded to the scene reported hearing dozens of gunshots.\nAs the exchange of gunfire continued, a fire broke out at the motel that caused heavy smoke in the area before the fire intensified at around midnight, destroying large parts of the building before the blaze was brought under control.\nTopeka Police confirmed that a total of four federal law enforcement officers were shot and injured, including 2 U.S. Marshals and an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). They all suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to area hospitals.\nIt remained unclear on early Sunday whether the suspect had managed to escape or whether he was killed in the fire.
