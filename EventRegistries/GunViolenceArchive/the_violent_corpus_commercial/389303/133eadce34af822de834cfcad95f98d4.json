Theophilus Smith with the Birmingham Police Department said.\nThe 13-year-old victim, whose name has not been released, was transported to the hospital and underwent surgery. Police say his injuries may be life-threatening.\nInvestigators are interviewing witnesses and are questioning four people about the shooting.\nOne man, who owns a body shop just across the street, said his workers were some of the first to be alerted about what happened.\n\"We had a young child come to our shop and say that there had been an accident in their home of a shooting. So one of my workers called 911 and dispatched police over here at the home here. It's a family of 6. There all good children, all good children. I think it's a tragedy that happened here,\" David Ortiz said.\nThe police department released the following statement about the shooting on Thursday night:\n\"This accidental shooting incident involving the juvenile is unfortunate, but preventable. The BPD would like to ask that all of our citizens be in the mindset that firearms are inherently dangerous and must always be stored carefully and handled with care. Handlers are taught to treat firearms with respect for their destructive capabilities, and strongly discouraged from playing or toying with firearms which is a common cause of accidents. The rules of gun safety follow from this mindset.\"\nCopyright 2015 WAFB. All rights reserved."}
