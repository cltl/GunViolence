She was later taken by ambulance to a Phoenix hospital.\nLapointe, her live-in boyfriend, had brought Paladino to YRMC, and had returned to the home to care for three girls, age 14 and 10-year-old twins, who had been left unattended, the release added.\nWhen officers arrived at the home to check on the children, they reportedly saw drug paraphernalia, an illegally altered shotgun, and a hole in the bedroom wall that appeared to have pellet spray surrounding it. In addition, they reported detecting an odor of marijuana.\nLapointe reportedly told officers that he and Paladino had had an argument about two hours before the shooting, but was unwilling to provide further information. A subsequent review of his criminal history \u201crevealed that he is a convicted felon and therefore a prohibited possessor of a firearm,\u201d the news release stated.\nAfter obtaining a search warrant, officers found six additional firearms, $1,520 in cash, 8.6 grams of methamphetamine, 6 ounces of marijuana, 2.3 grams of heroin, and other miscellaneous drug paraphernalia.\nPaladino, who was released from the hospital later that day, was arrested on Tuesday, Oct. 11, and booked in the Yavapai County Jail in Camp Verde.\n\u201cPrescott Valley Police Department reminds everyone that firearms in the home require special care, especially when children reside in the home,\u201d the news release stated, adding, \u201cFortunately, no other injuries occurred during this incident.\u201d"}
