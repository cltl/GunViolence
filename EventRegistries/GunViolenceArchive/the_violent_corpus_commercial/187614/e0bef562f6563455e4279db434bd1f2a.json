Stephen Fore said.\n\u201cThey say they found the child shot,\u201d Fore told The Atlanta Journal Constitution. \u201cThe child may have shot himself.\u201d\nKamarri was killed in a house in the 700 block of 3rd Street in Stone Mountain on Monday morning. The aunt, who was supposed to be watching the child while the mother was at work, told police she was asleep. The uncle said he found the deceased child when he returned home, Fore said.\nFore identified the aunt as Alexia Thomas, 23, and the uncle as Detray Shivers, 25. They are both also charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and Shivers is also charged with tampering with evidence after police found the pistol in a storm drainage area, Fore said.\nBoth are in the DeKalb County jail.\nHomicide charges may be added if detectives determine through gun powder residue and bullet trajectory tests that the gunshot was not self-inflicted, Fore said. The larger police agency is handling the investigation at the request of Stone Mountain Police.\n\u2014 Staff writer Mike Morris contributed to this report."}
