Police said a car sped past the house when someone at the party either instructed them or told them to slow down. But the driver opened fire instead.\nIt's unclear what type of vehicle the gunman was driving. Some witnesses recalled seeing a dark Chevrolet of some sort, but that's not certain, police said.\nThere is no description of the suspect other than black male, police said. It is uncertain whether the shooter knew anyone at the party at this point. Police are still investigating.\nThe public is urged to call Crimestoppers at 1-800-SPEAKUP if they have information to help solve this crime.\n\u25ba Related: Gun accidents kill kids every other day\nThis was the third fatal shooting in Detroit over the weekend.\nAt 1:25 a.m. today, a 26-year-old male was shot and killed while sitting in a Chevy Trailblazer on the 16600 block of Tuller.
