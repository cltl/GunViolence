She was later flown to Mother Francis Hospital in Tyler. The 23-year-old Morris died Sunday in Tyler.\nCarmen is married to Josh Morris, who was cleaning his firearms; however, the child is not theirs, Taylor said. Child Protective Services was called to investigate because there were two other children inside the house at the time of the shooting. Deputies interviewed Morris, Taylor said.\nDeputies continue to investigate the incident but believe it's nothing more than a tragic accident at this time, Taylor said.\nThe sheriff is not releasing additional details about the child involved in the shooting; however, the boy was Morris' 8-year-old brother, according to his mother Tammie Johnson.\nJosh Morris kept guns locked away in a safe and taught his children about gun safety, Johnson said. The couple were very outgoing and loving to the community including the Morris' 2-year-old and 5-year-old boys.\nMorris was the \u201chappiest person to be around and always giggling and laughing about anything, said Johnson and a close high school friend, Aerial Rios.\nRios and Morris were on cheer team in middle school and their friendship bond grew through high school. The ladies continued their friendship through social media where Morris made posts and shared photos of her two boys, Rios said.\n\u201cIt appeared she was an amazing mother and loved her husband and children very much,\u201d Rios said.\nFriends are putting together a bake sale to help with funeral costs and benefit the family. Donations of money or baked goods can be dropped off between 10:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday to Harcat and Lou's Diner in Elkhart.
