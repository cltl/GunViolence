The semi-automatic weapon, which is used by armed forces in Israel but is not common in the U.S., can retail at up to $5,000 on the black market, Knight said. The gun\u2019s owner didn\u2019t initially realize his weapon was missing.\nInvestigators believe Batt, a five-time felon, somehow had contact with the weapon that day.\nBased on information learned through a months-long wiretap operation targeting suspected meth and weapons dealers Arias and Serna, Knight said his agents believe that Batt approached Arias with the rifle in hopes that Arias would sell it to an out-of-state contact.\nBy the next day, however, the teens were back in possession of the rifle. While handling the gun, it apparently went off and left the 14-year-old boy seriously injured. Another teen \u2014 it\u2019s unclear who \u2014 fled the address with the stolen gun, Knight said.\nWallbraun told investigators after her arrest that the unidentified teen showed up at her door with the Tavor rifle.\nShe is accused of then helping coordinate the gun\u2019s sale to Arias, who in turn sold it to his contact.\nArias\u2019 out-of-state contact, however, was a DEA informant. When Arias finally sold the rifle for $2,500 on Sept. 14 to the informant\u2019s \u201cbrother-in-law,\u201d he was actually selling the stolen gun to an undercover agent, Knight said.\nThe entire scenario appeared tangential to the original DEA investigation targeting Arias and Serna; the couple had been under surveillance since November 2015 and had sold meth and guns to undercover agents multiple times, said Knight, who described them as professional criminals.\n\u201cThey have no other legitimate form of employment,\u201d Knight said, adding the couple appeared to work \u201cin tandem.\u201d\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Pete Hautzinger asked Gallagher to keep all four in custody, citing the high volumes of meth involved in the case and describing them as a \u201cprofound public safety risk\u201d at a \u201cprofound risk of flight.\u201d\nArias and Serna, who face the most charges including multiple counts of drug possession with intent to distribute, remain in custody after Gallagher said he couldn\u2019t impose bond conditions that would ensure both community safety and their appearance in court.\nBatt, who is only charged with possession of a weapon by a previous offender, also remains in custody.\nWallbraun, who allegedly bought meth from Serna, faces a single count of drug possession with intent to distribute. She was released from custody Tuesday, but will forfeit $100,000 if she violates her bond conditions, Gallagher said.\nAll four defendants are due to return to federal court at 10 a.m. Dec. 29."}
