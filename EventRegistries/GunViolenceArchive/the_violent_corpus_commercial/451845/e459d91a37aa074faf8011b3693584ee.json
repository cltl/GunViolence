Kiefer was bow hunting and fell about 15 feet.\nOn Saturday an 85-year-old man died of an apparent heart attack while hunting on land in the town of Scott, according to the Crawford County sheriff. Paramedics arrived to find the man\u2019s son performing CPR. James Evers was taken to Boscobel Hospital where he was pronounced dead.\nA 39-year-old Alaska man was killed Sunday in Columbia County after being shot by a companion.\nDepartment of Natural Resources Warden Jon King said the man was deer hunting with a 35-year-old Wisconsin woman when the man apparently handed a loaded rifle up to the woman while she was in a tree stand. The woman had mittens on and grasped the gun around the trigger. The weapon discharged and the man took a bullet just below the armpit.\nThe Associated Press reported it was the state\u2019s first firearm-related deer hunting fatality in three years. The warden said no other fatalities involving weapons has been reported to the DNR since the nine-day deer gun season began Saturday.\nThe Green Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Department reported a hunter died of an apparent heart attack while dragging a deer to his vehicle Saturday.\nElsewhere in Crawford County, a stray bullet struck an occupied home Sunday morning just east of Prairie du Chien.\nAccording to the sheriff\u2019s department, Terry Tesar, 54, shot and killed a deer, and the bullet traveled another 140 yards before breaking a window in the home on Bluff Wilderness Lane.\nNo one inside the residence was hurt. The incident remains under investigation, according to the sheriff\u2019s department, which said Tesar faces a possible trespassing citation.\nAt least two other hunters were injured in firearms-related incidents.\nA 14-year-old hunter shot his 26-year-old hunting companion in Marathon County on Sunday. The teen tried to de-cock a rifle when it slipped and fired, hitting the victim in the arms and chest, King said.\nThe other incident took place in Rock County around midday Saturday when a 16-year-old boy fell asleep and apparently shot himself in the leg, King said.\nOverall, the opening weekend harvest was up considerably from 2014. Hunters killed 90,280 deer through the first three days of the gun season last year. As of late Sunday evening, 108,780 deer had been killed this weekend.\nIt\u2019s unclear how license sales compare to the same point last year. As of 9 a.m. Saturday, the DNR had sold 591,783 licenses. Agency officials didn\u2019t immediately have comparable numbers going into opening morning of 2014.\nThe DNR had sold 609,779 licenses by the end of the nine-day season last year, however."}
