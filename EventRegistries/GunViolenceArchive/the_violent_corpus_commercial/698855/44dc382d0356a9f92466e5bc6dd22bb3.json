Midland Road. The deputy, a school resource officer, was in a room by himself when he negligently discharged a gun, said Michigan State Police Special 1st Lt. David Kaiser.\nThe bullet went through at least one wall and struck a female teacher in an adjacent room, Kaiser said.\n\"The teacher was struck in the neck area, but she was not injured,\" Kaiser said. \"The round did not break the skin.\"\nThe teacher was instructing students at the time, the lieutenant added.\nState police troopers are investigating the matter. They have not disclosed what prompted the deputy to have his gun out or why he compressed its trigger.\nThe deputy is on administrative leave as the investigation continues. Once the investigation is complete, troopers will forward their findings to the Bay County Prosecutor's Office for a decision on whether or not charges are issued.\nKaiser said he had initially expected the finished reports to have been sent to the prosecutor's office by Monday morning, but a home invasion in Tawas City on Sunday night that saw a homeowner shoot the alleged intruders -- killing one -- caused a delay as resources were needed to tend to that incident.\nThe Times was unable to contact Western High School Principal Judy Cox for comment."}
