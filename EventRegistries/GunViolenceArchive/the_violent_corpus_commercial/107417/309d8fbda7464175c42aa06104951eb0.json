Multiple guns were involved. Neighbors told the Orlando Sentinel they heard dozens of gunshots before ambulance and law enforcement officers began arriving about 5 a.m.\nAlmost two years ago, a birthday party ended in gunfire about 2:30 a.m. at the same location.\nTwo people were wounded in that incident, one who was found on the lawn and another who drove himself to Health Central Hospital in Ocoee before deputies arrived about. That incident and the latest one are not related, Watrel said.\nInvestigators want anyone who witnessed the shootings or anyone who knows the identity of the woman to call Crimeline at 800-423-8477."}
