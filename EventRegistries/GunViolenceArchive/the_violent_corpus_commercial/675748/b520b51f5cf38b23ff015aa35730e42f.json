According to police, the incident happened at around 9:30 p.m. near the intersection of Second Avenue and Metropolitan Avenue, about a mile away from the fairgrounds.\nThe child was caught in the gunfire in front of the TMA grocery store. That 6-year-old girl was shot in the chest, according to a witness at the scene. She was quickly rushed to Children\u2019s Medical Center in Dallas. The child\u2019s injuries were not thought to be life threatening.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a little Hispanic girl,\u201d said witness Jamal Najm. \u201cShe kept screaming \u2018papi, papi, papi.\u2019 The bullet went inside her chest, so I pray to God that she\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\nPolice said that the girl and her father were inside of their Jeep Grand Cherokee, traveling westbound through the area. When they passed the grocery store, two male suspects inside of a red Chevrolet Tahoe opened fire. A witness said that the suspects appeared to be aiming for a nearby business.\nInvestigators spent quite a bit of time checking out bullet holes that were left in the victim\u2019s vehicle, and interviewing people who witnessed the shooting. One man said that he was driving in front of the car that was shot up. He narrowly missed being hit. The little girl was the only injury reported.\n\u201cI was very scared, afraid for my life,\u201d added Najm. \u201cCame out of the car to check myself and see if the bullet went in my body, but thank God it didn\u2019t. But somebody else, the bullet went through their body.\u201d\nAuthorities are still searching for the suspects, and trying to learn their motivation for the drive-by shooting. Anyone who may have information about this case is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 214-373-TIPS. There is a $5,000 reward being offered for tips that lead to an arrest and indictment."}
