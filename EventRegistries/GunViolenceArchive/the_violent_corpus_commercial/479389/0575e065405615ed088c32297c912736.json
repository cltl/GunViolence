Tom Hansen said.\nAccording to a report on KTVU-TV, a man in the car asked one of the boys why he was wearing Nike Cortez shoes, to which one of the teens, whose identities have not been released, replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d One of the suspects reportedly fired back, saying, \u201cGang members like to wear those.\u201d\nThe car pulled away, made a U-turn, then came back and fired approximately five shots at the boys, Hansen said.\nPolice described the victims\u2019 injuries as \u201cserious,\u201d and all four boys were taken to the hospital for treatment. Two of them have since been released, and one of the teens who remains in the hospital is undergoing surgery to remove a bullet in his knee.\nBoth the victims\u2019 families and the police insist that none of the teens is a gang member, and they were unaware of any significance between gang affiliations and the pair of sneakers.\n\u201cWe have absolutely no reason to believe they are affiliated with any type of gang,\u201d Hansen said.\nA detailed suspect description wasn\u2019t available, but the men in the vehicle were described as white and Hispanic men in their early to mid-20s. No arrests have been made in the incident.\nThe vehicle was described as a white or light-colored, late model, four-door sedan.\nAnyone with information should call Detective Aguirre at 925-809-7726 or Detective Folena at 925-809-7743."}
