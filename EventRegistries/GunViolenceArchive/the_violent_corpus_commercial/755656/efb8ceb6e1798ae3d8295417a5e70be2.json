Pittman then attempted to unload the gun but accidentally shot himself in the foot, according to Yarbrough.\nAfter leaving the hospital, deputies went to Pittman\u2019s home on 99 Wilson Circle to make sure the house was secure. Upon their arrival, they reported a heavy smell of marijuana coming from the home and saw drug paraphernalia in plain sight, Yarbrough said. The deputies then passed along the information to the narcotics division.\nA little over one week later, the narcotics unit served a search warrant on the home and uncovered over 3 ounces of marijuana, several oxycodone, hydrocodone, and alprazolam pills along over $2,000 in cash, according to Yarbrough.\nThe .40 caliber Glock handgun Pittman shot himself with was also located, according to Yarbrough.\nBoth Tamarcus Pittman and Shakure Pittman, 22, were arrested and charged with marijuana possession with intent to distribute and narcotics possession.\nShakure Pittman was also charged with possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, as the firearm was found in his room, according to Yarbrough.\n****\nClay Neely: clay@newnan.com, @clayneely"}
