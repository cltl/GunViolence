The teenagers were not involved in gang activity, but police believed they were caught in the crossfire of a gang retaliation shooting.\nThis is a story update. The previous story is below.\nOCEANSIDE (CNS) - A search was under way Thursday for the assailants who opened fire on four teenagers, killing two of them and leaving the others wounded, at a North County park with a history of deadly gang violence.\nPatrol officers responding to reports of gunfire at Libby Lake Park in northern Oceanside found the underage victims - three boys and a girl - shortly before 9 p.m. Wednesday, according to police.\nMedics pronounced two of them dead at the scene and took the others to hospitals for treatment of serious wounds, Lt. Aaron Doyle said. The names of the slain youths were withheld pending family notification.\nFollowing the gunshots, witnesses described seeing several men or teenage boys in dark clothing fleeing in a gray or silver 2005 or 2006 Toyota Tacoma or Toyota Tundra extended-cab pickup truck, according to Doyle.\nThe motive for the attack was under investigation, the lieutenant said.\nThe shooting occurred near a memorial for two youths gunned down in a gang assault nearly two years ago. Late on the night of May 3, 2011, Sandra Salgado, 14, and her boyfriend, 16-year-old Fernando Solano, were slain on a hillside at the park.\nThree documented gang members await trial on double-murder charges for the slayings. The 20-year-old alleged gunman faces a possible death sentence if convicted, and the others are in line for potential terms of life in prison.\nA fourth defendant pleaded guilty late last year to being an accessory after the fact in the case.\nThe accused shooter's girlfriend testified that the killings were an act of revenge for an attack on one of his gang cohorts days earlier."}
