The younger one, now at UK Hospital, who was shot multiple times Thursday night.\nAccording to court records, 22-year-old Robert Record showed up at a Shell gas station on South Broadway with a gunshot wound. He was accidentally shot once time in the back, according to documents.\nThe investigation led officers to Red Mile Road where a stand off lasted for about 3 hours, however, no one was found inside.\n19-year-old Saquan Freeman was shot multiple times in the chest at that home and was taken to Saint Joseph hospital by a private vehicle, according to court documents. The teen was then rushed to UK Hospital, where he is in serious condition.\nPaperwork states all of this stems from a drug-related robbery involving Demetrioun Boaz, who faces a first degree robbery charge and has already turned himself in to police.\nLexington police are still investigating but say charges are likely against 19-year-old Saquan Freeman.\nRecord is expected to make a full recovery."}
