Kevin Haynes told KATU.\nHaynes said the father planned to put the guns away in a safe place as soon as his family got home.\n\"Obviously there was a mistake made, but does that mistake reach to the level to something that was criminal? We won't know that until we ask the questions,\" Haynes said.\nThe incident happened around 2 p.m. in the 2000 block of Mistletoe Road just outside of town.\nDeputies say the boy's father had been cleaning several guns and left a loaded .40-caliber handgun on the coffee table. He left the room for a moment and when he came back his son had grabbed the gun and then pulled the trigger.\nThe bullet ripped through the boy's leg and flew into another room.\nThe boy's parents drove him to West Valley Hospital where he was then flown by medical helicopter to a hospital in Portland.\nThe boy is in stable condition but was seriously injured.\nDeputies are investigating and have not yet said if there will be charges filed in the incident.\nNo one else was injured."}
