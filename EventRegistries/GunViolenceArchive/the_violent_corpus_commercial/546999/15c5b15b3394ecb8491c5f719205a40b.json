Two county police officers, Georgetown Fire, an air ambulance and Yellow EMS all responded to the scene after word that the victim had been shot in the chest. The girl's first name in hospital records was spelled Alysa, according to Kosair officials.\nThe incident prompted Loop to issue three reminders about gun safety - always keep the weapon unloaded until ready to use, keep the finger off the trigger until ready to shoot and keep the gun pointed in a safe direction.\nReporter Grace Schneider can be reached at 502-582-4082 or by email, gschneider@courier-journal.com."}
