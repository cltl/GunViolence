However, they do not believe he was the first one in his group to fire shots.\nThe fight began after members of one group asked to borrow a couple of skateboards from the other group, said officer Tanner Tixier, a spokesman for the Albuquerque Police Department. The first two skateboards were returned, but when someone asked for the third back, a fist fight broke out.\nIt turned into a gunfight.\nTixier said there was no indication the shooting was race-related or gang-related.\nStills taken from a cellphone video depict many people fighting in a crowd before four muzzle flashes are seen, indicating shots were fired in the air. Two of the injured skateboarders \u2013 one wearing a yellow shirt and the other in red \u2013 can be seen in the video, and Tixier said one man in his 20s is now paralyzed and just gave his first statement to police at the beginning of the week.\n\u201cWe do believe that Jaquise Lewis was the one that fired those rounds against the other young man in yellow,\u201d Tixier said. \u201cWe can\u2019t see everything in the video, so we can\u2019t say 100 percent, but we\u2019re fairly confident that this is a picture of Jaquise Lewis shooting the individual in the yellow shirt.\u201d\nDetectives have identified the man who they believe shot Lewis but are not pressing charges. He was not injured in the shooting.\n\u201cWe have had four meetings with the district attorneys showing them what we know at this point and showing them the full video,\u201d Tixier said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all come to the conclusion at this point that Jaquise Lewis was shot in self-defense.\u201d\nTixier asked for additional witnesses to come forward with information and said detectives have mostly only been able to interview the skaters, not anyone who was part of Lewis\u2019 group of friends.\nNo guns were recovered from the scene, he said.\nIn an autopsy report obtained by the Journal, the Office of the Medical Investigator ruled Lewis was shot in the left back and left upper arm and \u201cthe range of fire for both injuries is best classified as distant.\u201d\nPolice said a person does not have to be facing another for a shooting to be considered self-defense.\n\u201cHe was walking back toward another group,\u201d Tixier said. \u201cHe had already showed propensity to not only fire rounds but also threatened numerous individuals with a gun, and he was rushing back in the direction where there was a group of people.\u201d\nLewis should not have been at the park that night, according to Larry Gallegos, a spokesman for the Bernalillo County Youth Services Center.\nLewis was under house arrest after being charged with negligent use of a deadly weapon and unlawful carrying of a handgun by a person under 19 in early March, according to his order of release.\n[photoshelter-gallery g_id=\u201dG0000Nf2hN9XTxHM\u201d g_name=\u201dLos-Altos-Skate-Park-shooting-03-22-2015\u2033 width=\u201d600\u2033 f_fullscreen=\u201dt\u201d bgtrans=\u201dt\u201d pho_credit=\u201diptc\u201d twoup=\u201df\u201d f_bbar=\u201dt\u201d f_bbarbig=\u201df\u201d fsvis=\u201df\u201d f_show_caption=\u201dt\u201d crop=\u201df\u201d f_enable_embed_btn=\u201dt\u201d f_htmllinks=\u201dt\u201d f_l=\u201dt\u201d f_send_to_friend_btn=\u201df\u201d f_show_slidenum=\u201dt\u201d f_topbar=\u201df\u201d f_show_watermark=\u201dt\u201d img_title=\u201dcasc\u201d linkdest=\u201dc\u201d trans=\u201dxfade\u201d target=\u201d_self\u201d tbs=\u201d5000\u2033 f_link=\u201dt\u201d f_smooth=\u201df\u201d f_mtrx=\u201dt\u201d f_ap=\u201dt\u201d f_up=\u201df\u201d height=\u201d400\u2033 btype=\u201dold\u201d bcolor=\u201d#CCCCCC\u201d ]\n\u201cBeing on house arrest means the CCP (community custody program) officer would have to give him permission to leave the house,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cThe night of the shooting, he did not call for permission to leave the house.\u201d\nIf Lewis had requested permission to leave the house, he would have had to be accompanied by a guardian. Lewis\u2019 grandparents were acting as his guardians. They refused requests for an interview.\nOn March 1, Lewis was at a friend\u2019s house learning how to disassemble a gun, according to a court document filed in the 2nd Judicial District Court. Witnesses told police the gun went off and Lewis\u2019 14-year-old friend was struck in the buttocks by the bullet.\nLewis took off but later returned to the scene and cooperated with police, according to the document.\nHe told police he would show them where he had thrown the gun, but they were unable to find it, according to the document.\nLewis\u2019 friend told police it was a black Ruger 9mm handgun.\nPolice have not found any of the guns fired in the Los Altos shooting, although they found casings. Tixier refused to say what kinds of guns police believe were fired.\nThe assistant district attorney who was prosecuting the charge against Lewis of negligent use of a deadly weapon wonders if there is a connection between the shootings.\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly wondering whether the gun used in the case I was prosecuting was the same as in the skate park shooting,\u201d Alma Rosa Delgado said.\nAn attorney for Lewis\u2019 grandparents said he does not believe the March 1 shooting is relevant to Lewis\u2019s death.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re taking the position today that suggests Jaquise Lewis died from someone acting in self-defense, give us the entirety of the evidence, let us, the community, judge this process,\u201d said Ahmad Assed, a defense attorney representing the family. \u201cDon\u2019t let APD call the shots in this conversation. The African-American community deserves better; the whole community deserves better.\u201d\nAssed said he requested all pertinent documents, including police reports, recordings and documentation of evidence from the Police Department, under the Inspection of Public Records Act. He said he was told his request was too burdensome and could not be completed at this time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been seven or eight weeks since this young man died, and we don\u2019t have anyone charged in this process,\u201d Assed said. \u201cThey presented an opinion based on certain photos, I want to be able to look at the entire video.\u201d\nTixier said police are not showing the full video at this time in the hopes that some of the people identified in the stills will come forward as witnesses.\n\u201cIf we show the video, there will be no way for us to corroborate if what they told us is accurate, or if they\u2019re just reciting back what they saw in the video,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to hold it so we can compare their statements to us with it.\u201d"}
