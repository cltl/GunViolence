Six others were injured in the shooting, ranging in age from 17-27 years of age. One of the men injured remains hospitalized in critical condition.\nThe park is located near Eubank and Lomas boulevards.\nOn Monday, police said the shooting was possibly gang-related. On Tuesday, however, they said though individuals who may associate themselves with gang activity were present, a fist fight over the skateboard appears to be the cause of the gunplay.\nThey said multiple shooters fired multiple rounds, though no arrests have been made. Witnesses recalled hearing as many as 20 shots fired around 10 p.m.\nOne woman, who was at the park with her children, said there were two groups on separate sides of the park. At one point, the groups got into an argument, and that\u2019s when the shooting started, she said.\nAccording to police, two separate groups were celebrating birthday parties at the park Sunday evening.\n\u201cOur hearts go out to all of the families involved in this tragedy,\u201d said Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden. \u201cWe are working tirelessly to thoroughly investigate this very complex crime scene. We are asking residents and those involved in the incident to please come forward and report even the smallest details.\u201d\nTwo vehicles were sealed and towed from the scene, pending the execution of search warrants.\nPolice are considering extra patrols in the area to prevent retaliation. They said they've been called out to the park less than 20 times in the past three years.\nPolice said the city's Parks Department has asked them to do a safety review of the park. They will see if a curfew or security cameras may prevent something like this from happening again.\n\"This was a tragic and senseless event,\u201d said Mayor Richard Berry. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the young man who lost his life and to those who were injured. (The Albuquerque Police Department) will work diligently to investigate the incident and bring those responsible to justice.\"\nLewis' friends and family placed flowers and lit candles there Monday -- many of whom were in a state of disbelief.\n\u201cHe was a very loving boy who was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d said Lewis\u2019 cousin, Wanda Green.\nWhen Lewis' mother, Munah Green, returned to the memorial Tuesday, she found charred remains of several items. She said it's senseless people are acting as though her son was nobody.\nShe believes the shooting and memorial vandalism are race-related. Action 7 News heard racial slurs coming from cars driving by the memorial service Monday.\n\"It's a racial issue that's going on right now,\" she said. \"They were here earlier. They were driving by screaming racial slurs out.\"\nKOAT Action 7 News is following this story and will update it as soon as more information is available."}
