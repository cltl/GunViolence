They remain in the Butler County Jail, according to jail records.\nGmoser called the double fatal shooting \u201ca horrific crime.\u201d\nThen he stressed that Hamilton and the entire Butler County region won\u2019t succumb to this \u201ccaliber of violence, caliber of lawlessness.\u201d\nHamilton Police Capt. Marc McManus, filling in for Police Chief Craig Bucheit, said the two victims were \u201ctargeted\u201d and he stressed Wednesday\u2019s drive-by shooting was not random.\nAt 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, he said the alleged shooters pulled up next to a black Ford Mustang on Central Avenue and opened fire, striking the driver and passenger.\nOne victim, Orlando Gilbert, 25, of Hamilton, was pronounced dead at the scene and Todd Berus, 25, of Hamilton, died Wednesday night at Fort Hamilton Hospital, police said.\nBoth died from gunshot wounds and their deaths were ruled homicides, according to the Butler County Coroner\u2019s Office.\nOn Wednesday, there was much speculation that the drive-by shooting was in retaliation to Sunday\u2019s shooting at Doubles Bar that claimed the life of Kalif Goens. His brother, Mondale Goens, 21, is charged with murder and he\u2019s accused of shooting Katrinia Price, 18, and Tavaris Gilbert, 20, both of Hamilton.\nMcManus said he couldn\u2019t discuss the case, but he said the department was \u201cexploring\u201d a \u201cprobable\u201d link between the two shootings.\nDuring the funeral service for Goens on Wednesday, residents were urged to not retaliate, according to a local pastor who attended.\n\u201cWe walked out of that service feeling good about the word that we heard and thought it resonated with the young men and people in the community, but evidently it did not,\u201d said Pastor Greg Andrews from House of Deliverance Ministry in Hamilton. \u201cThey\u2019re young and I do understand \u2026 they\u2019re angry, mad, they\u2019re upset and that\u2019s family,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all family. We are all family and we\u2019ve got to understand we\u2019re family and black lives do matter. Black lives matter when black lives take care of black lives.\u201d\nGmoser praised the efforts of the Hamilton police department, Butler County Sheriff\u2019s Office, other agencies and canine officers that assisted in the quick apprehension of the three suspects who drove into Ross Twp. following the shooting.\nHe also appreciated the number of witnesses who assisted police and called 911. That wasn\u2019t the case at Doubles Bar, where Gmoser said only a few of the 100 to 200 patrons inside came forward with information.\nHe knows there are people who don\u2019t want to be called \u201csnitches,\u201d though he prefers the term \u201ccooperative witnesses.\u201d\nMcManus said the cooperation from bar patrons was \u201climited at best.\u201d\nAll three charged with aggravated murder have prior criminal records, according to records obtained by the Journal-News.\nTwo years ago, Patete, 21, was sentenced to six months in jail and five years of community control after being found guilty of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, a fourth-degree felony, according to Licking County Court records. Between May 16-17, 2014, Patete engaged in sexual conduct with a 13-year-old, according to court records.\nRelated\nHe was ordered to pay all court costs and fees and have no contact with anyone under the age of 18. Patete was also classified as a Tier II sexual offender.\nGibby was indicted by the Fairfield County Grand Jury on one count of possession of crack cocaine in 2005, and two counts of possession of crack cocaine and three counts of trafficking cocaine later that year, according to court records. She was sentenced to a four-year jail sentence.\nIn 2009, Harris was charged with kidnapping, two counts of aggravated robbery and four counts of robbery in Franklin County, records show. He was released from prison earlier this year after serving six years and is currently on probation."}
