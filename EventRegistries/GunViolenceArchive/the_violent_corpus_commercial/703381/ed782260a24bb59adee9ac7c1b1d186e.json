Les Vaughan said in the release.\nWhen deputies arrived at the home, they made their way inside and found the mother and son\u2019s bodies in a bed. Both appeared to have died from single gunshot wounds, Vaughan said, and an initial investigation determined Dickerson shot her son before shooting herself. The motive was unknown, Vaughan said.\nThe Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation is assisting the Sheriff\u2019s Office with the case.\nKyle Hinchey\n918-581-8451\nkyle.hinchey@tulsaworld.com"}
