A 19-year-old woman, Amanda John of Asylum Street in New Haven, was also among the victims of the shooting.\nOther shooting victims include:\n\u2014 Jahad Brumsey, 29, of Garden Street in New Haven (critical)\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 Nijia Ward, 24, of Lilac Street in New Haven\n\u2014 Albert Dickerson, 34, of Sherman Parkway in New Haven\n\u2014 Ivette Sterling, 25, of Osborn Street in New Haven\nThe homicide is the fourth club-related of the year and 16th overall, according to police. Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said, in his 20 years as mayor, he has never seen such a high percentage of club-related homicides.\nHe called on the state legislature Saturday afternoon at a press conference to adopt wide reforms to target the violence seen in and around nightclubs across cities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s curious to me in this state we stand on our high horse and say \u2018jeez\u2019; after Sandy Hook we should be banning all these assault weapons and such, true enough,\u201d DeStefano said. \u201cBut it seems to me, after these kinds of incidents, you know look in the mirror in Connecticut and take action to save lives.\u201d\nGov. Dannel Malloy was also on hand for the press conference Saturday afternoon. He expressed his condolences to the victims\u2019 families and said he will work with DeStefano and the legislature on some of the proposals.\n\u201cAs a former mayor myself for 14 years, I absolutely agree with almost everything the mayor has said,\u201d Malloy said.\nDeStefano made a wide range of proposals that are likely to draw the ire of many liquor establishments across the state.\nHe proposed the following measures, many of which would have to be adopted by the state legislature:\n\u2014 Ability for cities to levy fees for nightclubs in a district where heavy police presence is required.\n\u2014 Mandate that private security at nightclubs be licensed and trained by the Police Department.\n\u2014 Ability for city to sign off on licenses for clubs.\n\u2014 Review \u201cmosaic\u201d of different liquor licenses and see whether or not state should simplify them.\nDeStefano\u2019s term as mayor will be up before the start of next year\u2019s state legislative session. He said it would be common sense for his successor to push for the same proposals, as well.\nA New Haven officer was outside of the club at the corner of Hamilton Street around 3:30 a.m. when he heard gunfire coming from inside.\nPolice spokesman Officer David Hartman said an officer rushed into the club this morning as more than a hundred patrons rushed out the main doorway. Several other officers within the block arrived on scene within seconds.\nSix gunshot victims were located within the club\u2019s after-hours area, and Hartman said all available officers, along with firefighters and EMTs from the New Haven Fire Department, were dispatched. Ambulances were summoned to take the victims to area hospitals.\nHartman said that detectives had begun their investigation and had been interviewing several witnesses. No suspects had been identified, and police were asking anyone with information about this crime to call the Detective Bureau at 203-946-6304. Hartman said calls may be made anonymously.\nPolice said that they were told the owners of the club, John Bertini and Peter Forchetti, were not on the property during the shootings. Hartman said that the Key Club is an adult entertainment venue, and the area of the club that was open to the public has a \u201cbring-your-own-alcohol\u201d policy. The interior was littered with drug paraphernalia and drug packaging, and smelled of marijuana, police said.\nThe Key Club Cabaret\u2019s website says it is Connecticut\u2019s largest after-hours club Friday and Saturday, and Connecticut\u2019s hottest club. The club\u2019s Twitter said it was offering happy hour all day Friday, and invited people to stop in.\nCall Rich Scinto at 203-789-5748.\nRegister Community Engagement Editor Shahid Abdul-Karim and Register staff member Charlotte Adinolfi contributed to this story.Have questions, feedback or ideas about our news coverage?
