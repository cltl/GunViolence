Amos Rudd, 57, died Sunday from his injuries suffered Saturday night.\nPortsmouth Police said the shooting occurred at 603 Adams St. and they were called to that location at about 7:45 p.m. after receiving word that a man had been shot there. Portsmouth Police Operations Captain Lynn Brewer told the Daily Times, upon officers arrival they found a man sitting on the couch clutching his chest. The man reportedly asked them to help him, stating that he had been shot. The man then became unable to speak further with officers.\nRudd was transported to Southern Ohio Medical Center and then flown to the trauma unit at Grant Medical Center in Columbus. Brewer said Rudd underwent emergency surgery but passed away from his injuries on Sunday afternoon.\nDaniel Morris, 62, of Portsmouth was also present in the house when the incident occurred. Brewer said Morris told police that he dropped a gun and when it struck the floor it discharged and the bullet struck Rudd.\nCharles Roe, who was also present in the residence when the incident occurred, helped officers recover the gun. Roe reportedly told officers that when the gun went off and he realized that Rudd had been shot, he kicked the gun out of the way and it slid under the refrigerator.\nThe incident remains under investigation and anyone with information that could be of any help at all is encouraged to contact the Portsmouth Police Department Detective Division at 740-354-1600 or the 911 Dispatch Center at 740-353-4101.\nThere are no known funeral arrangements for Rudd available at this time.\nReach Frank Lewis at 740-353-3101, ext. 1928, or on Twitter @franklewis."}
