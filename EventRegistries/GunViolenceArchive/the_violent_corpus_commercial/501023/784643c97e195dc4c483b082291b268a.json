Irondale Police Chief Ken Atkinson told CBS42 the 3-year-old brother of the girl discovered a gun on a nightstand in the room the two were playing in. He accidently pulled the trigger, shooting his sister in the head. The two were at the home of their great-grandparents.\n\u201cI came in and when I came in the door, my son came out and said she had been shot,\u201d said the victim\u2019s great grandfather, Joel Watson.\nAtkinson said the family members who were home at the time did not know the gun was in the room the kids were playing in. The gun had been placed there by another family member who was not home at the time, and did not know the kids would be there, according to Atkinson.\n\u201cHer grandma was laying the towel on her head and laid down there and started praying, she was praying, I was praying, my wife was screaming and praying. Nobody knows how that feel until you experience it,\u201d said Watson.\nThe girl was flown to Children\u2019s Hospital where she later died. Police call the shooting a \u201ctragic accident.\u201d\n\u201cMy understanding is the great grandfather had the pistol laying on the dresser. The uncle and grandmother didn\u2019t know it was laying there as well,\u201d said Irondale Police Chief Ken Atkinson.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
