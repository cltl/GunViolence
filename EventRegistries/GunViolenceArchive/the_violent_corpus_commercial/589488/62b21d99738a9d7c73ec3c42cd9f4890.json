(KOIN) \u2014 The 29-year-old accused of killing 3 people and critically wounding another in a shooting near Woodburn on Monday was in court Tuesday afternoon.\nBonifacio Oseguera-Gonzalez was arrested along I-84 east of Portland not long after the 4 were found at a berry farm in the 13000 block of Killiam Road NE.\nAuthorities quickly got a description of the suspect and the car and let other law enforcement agencies know. Around 1:30 p.m. \u2014 just more than 2 hours after the shootings \u2014 the Oregon State Police, the Hood River County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Hood River Police stopped the car and took him into custody without incident.\n\u201cHe definitely was trying to make a getaway,\u201d Marion County Lt.

The only previous times police went to the house were over reports of loud parties.\nVictims identified\nRuben Rigoberto-Reyes, 60, and Edmundo Amaro-Bajonero, 26, died at the scene. Katie Gildersleeve, 30, was rushed by ambulance to Legacy Emanuel Hospital in Portland. She later died from her injuries.\nThe 4th person, Refugio Modesto-DeLaCruz, was taken by ambulance to OHSU. He is critically injured but is expected to survive.\nThe 3 men lived at the Killiam Road house, while Gildersleeve was the girlfriend of another man who was not home at the time of the shootings.\nOseguera-Gonzalez, the suspected shooter, was known to \u201cfrequent the residence,\u201d the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a release.\n\u2018Very shocking\u2019\nA neighbor told KOIN 6 News she\u2019s never seen any problems at the farm.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s, like, very shocking.

It\u2019s very peaceful and then this happening. It\u2019s really shocking.\u201d\nIn an email thread with KOIN 6 News, Katie Gildersleeve\u2019s sister, Rachel Landry, said she was the most kind-hearted person she\u2019s ever known.\n\u201cShe always thought about others before herself, she lived to laugh and was a joker always laughing and being silly.
