GEORGE\u2013 A teenage boy was taken to the hospital by Life Flight Saturday afternoon after unintentionally shooting himself while recreating in the Warner Valley area.\n\u201cInitial investigation shows that it was accidental,\u201d Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Dave Crouse said.\nThe emergency call was received at 3:57 p.m. The boy, a 17-year-old St. George resident, had been in the Warner Valley area, just outside the Washington City limits, shooting guns with some adult family members when he accidentally shot himself with a handgun, Crouse said.\n\u201cI was told it was 9 mm,\u201d Crouse said.\nThe bullet entered the boy\u2019s abdomen area.\nThe teen was conscious and alert when emergency personnel arrived, Crouse said. Life Flight was called in, and the boy was airlifted to Dixie Regional Medical Center.\nHe believes the boy was in stable condition at the time he was transported to the hospital\nCrouse said he believes the boy was in stable condition at the time he was transported to the hospital, but he said he does not know the boy\u2019s current condition.\nResponders from Utah State Parks, the Bureau of Land Management, the Washington City Police Department, the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Life Flight responded to the scene.\nCrouse said it can be difficult to determine which city has jurisdiction when an emergency occurs in Warner Valley, as the Warner Valley area covers portions of St. George, Washington and Hurricane. For that reason, responders from multiple cities often respond to Warner Valley emergency calls, he said.\n\u201cThe victim\u2019s condition is a primary concern more than jurisdiction,\u201d Crouse said.\nThis report is based on preliminary information provided by law enforcement or other emergency responders and may not contain the full scope of findings."}
