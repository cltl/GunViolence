But instead, his family is planning to bury him.\nBaltimore City streets are filled with gunfire as police investigate another shooting. This one\u2013injuring six and killing another\u2013 happened Saturday night in the 1500-block of W. Fayette Street.\n\u201cI think to hear seven people shot in a cluster is outrageous for this city. And it\u2019s unacceptable for us as a whole,\u201d said Commissioner Anthony Batts, Baltimore City Police.\nDeshaun Jones\u2013just 15 years-old and set to start at Frederick Douglass High School this week \u2014 was shot and killed.\n\u201cI seen him laying there fighting for his life,\u201d a woman said.\nBalloons and a stuffed animal are now left to show condolences for the life lost. Those living across the street are still overwhelmed with emotion.\nPolice believe the shooting started over an illegal game of dice.\n\u201cHe was a young child. Nobody\u2019s life deserves to be taken,\u201d a woman said.\nThere are no confirmed reports that Jones was part of the game, or the intended target.\n\u201cSome of the other six victims, non-fatal victims, have had police histories. They have come in contact with us at different times. We know at least one of the victims has been shot prior,\u201d Batts said.\nThe violence that has triggered across West Baltimore has residents sick to their stomachs. They\u2019re begging the criminals to put the guns down.\nShootings in Baltimore have seen a frightening increase into the double digits. The extra police officers on the streets are not enough to bring comfort to those in the middle of a war zone.\n\u201cEverybody just needs to get together. Police, everybody,\u201d a woman said.\nJust this week, Baltimore City Police added an extra 150 officers to the streets.\nNo arrests have been made in the shooting."}
