They drove to a hotel as they had done several times before, calling it a girls night out.\nBut Church, 50, had other plans this time, a murder-suicide, and Eureka investigators hope to unravel the reasons behind it.\nPolice trying to trace Church\u2019s final hours and days say it appears she was under mounting pressures in her life. They also say she had untreated depression.\nSometime that night or the next morning, Church shot her granddaughter, Alexis, once in the head then shot and killed herself in a first-floor room at the Holiday Inn at 4901 Six Flags Road.\nTheir bodies were found, clothed and in the bed, by hotel staff at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday. An autopsy determined they both died of a single shot to the head. Routine toxicology tests are pending.\nLt. David Wilson of the Eureka police said Thursday that investigators haven\u2019t found a suicide note, but they are learning from relatives what kind of pressures Church was facing.\nFriends of Church\u2019s told the Post-Dispatch that one of her two sons died of a drug overdose five years ago, and her husband also died, compounding her stress and depression.\nChurch had custody of Alexis, who had some emotional issues and needed special attention, Wilson said. Church\u2019s 81-year-old mother, who had Alzheimer's, had been in a nursing home but was to move back in with them soon, with Church as caretaker.\n\u201cSo obviously those situations bring on stress,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe mental health issues are obviously the cause for this, but did she just feel she\u2019s the only caretaker for the child and if she\u2019s going to take her own life, who\u2019s going to take care of the child?\u201d\nChurch had custody of Alexis since 2011, according to court documents. Alexis was the daughter of Michael S. Church and Tabitha Hamm-Picard, who agreed to let Colleen Church take custody.\nColleen Church lived at her mother\u2019s town house in the 1500 block of Forest Springs Drive in an unincorporated area of west St. Louis County. She lived there with Michael Church and Alexis. They helped raise the girl together, Wilson said. Church's elderly mother had Alzheimer's, relatives say, and was known to slip out of the town house and wander the neighborhood when Church left to pick up Alexis from school.\nColleen Church had sought help for depression and was treated with medication at times over the years, police said. But she wasn\u2019t consistently treated.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t sound like she had a doctor she saw regularly,\u201d Wilson said.\nAlexis\u2019 other grandmother, Kim Hamm-Picard, said she knew Church had faced depression and sorrow.\n\u201cI feel bad for Colleen,\u201d Hamm-Picard said. \u201cShe\u2019s been handed more than a person can handle.\u201d\nBut she can\u2019t understand killing Alexis. Hamm-Picard said her own daughter, Alexis' birth mother, is a heroin addict and unable to care for the child. But Hamm-Picard, who lives in Wildwood, a few miles from the hotel, said she or the girl's aunt would have taken the girl if Church had called. Relatives would have stepped up \u201cin a heartbeat,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very selfish,\u201d said Hamm-Picard, 57. \u201cThe nerve of her to take Lexi from us. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\nOne family friend said Church had behaved oddly in recent days, and those close to her are questioning things they didn\u2019t act on. But Hamm-Picard said she had spoken to Church a few weeks ago and nothing seemed amiss.\nMichael Church was shell-shocked and teary-eyed Thursday when he stopped by the house to retrieve some belongings. He said he was not ready to talk.\n\u201cI do want to explain everything,\u201d Michael Church said. \u201cI do want to give out details because I think people need to know, but I want to make sure I have my message right.\u201d\nUNHEARD SHOTS\nIt wasn\u2019t unusual for Colleen Church to take her granddaughter for a night\u2019s stay at a hotel. \u201cThey would call it a girls night out,\u201d Wilson said. But it was unusual that she picked her granddaughter up early from school. Michael Church was concerned when he tried calling and texting his mother and was unable to reach her, Wilson said.\nHe went to work Monday evening, and grew more concerned when he returned home and they still weren\u2019t there.\nThe time of death isn\u2019t clear. No one at the hotel reported hearing gunshots; the rooms on either side were vacant. The hotel staff remembered seeing the woman and little girl on Monday evening but nothing seemed unusual. Employees found the bodies after the Churches failed to leave by the 11 a.m. checkout deadline Tuesday.\nPolice found a handgun in the hotel room. Michael Church is working with police to learn more about medications his mother may have been prescribed in the past or missed taking.\nA day before she checked into the hotel, Colleen Church reposted on her Facebook page a photo that said, in part: \u201cYou never truly know the daily struggle of others.\u201d But she also shared a funny picture of a dog and another post saying she had done well on a test of commonly misspelled words. \u201cNot to brag. Lol,\u201d she wrote."}
