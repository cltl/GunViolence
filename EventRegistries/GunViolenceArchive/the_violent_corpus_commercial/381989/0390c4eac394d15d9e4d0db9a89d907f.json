According to court documents that toddler killed was Tiberius Durcan. His mother posted a picture of the toddler on Facebook on Friday.\nMason County sheriff's deputies were called to the home in the 700 block of East Road of Tralee 6 miles north of Shelton at about 6 p.m. after a woman called 911 asking for a welfare check on her estranged husband and two small children.\nThe 32-year-old woman said she had recently separated from her husband, 52-year-old Sean Durcan from Shelton, and had sought refuge at a local motel in the Shelton area. She said she was worried about her estranged husband and two children since she was unable to contact them. She told deputies that Durcan had become despondent because of the separation. Durcan was served with divorce papers on Wednesday.\nDeputies who went to the home smelled a strong odor of gasoline coming from the house. Investigators believe Durcan planned to set the house on fire. When deputies went inside, they found a 4-year old boy sitting in the living room area. He was taken out of the house and reunited with his mother.\nDuring a search of the home, deputies found Durcan dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. A deceased 17-month-old child was found with him.\nThe investigation into the deaths is ongoing. An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday to determine how the toddler was killed.\nLIKE KIRO 7 Eyewitness News on Facebook"}
