Pagana\u2019s aunt, Jessica Anchundia, said his mother was inconsolable.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in a better world but I hope my sister gets through this and all these young people have to understand guns is not the answer,\" said Jessica Anchundia, the Victim's aunt. \"You shouldn\u2019t be playing with guns.\"\nFamily members said it appeared to be an accident. Officers said the alleged shooter, Juan Acosta, 17, ran from the scene. He was found a short time later and police said he confessed to shooting his friend by mistake.\nPagan\u2019s friends spent Thursday tweeting about the teen and the dangers of playing with guns. It was a message Anchnudia echoed.\n\u201cMothers, if you have a son or daughter that has a gun, please return it to the police station or get rid of it because this is your life, this is your sons' and daughters' life,\u201d Anchundia said.\nPolice haven\u2019t said where the children got the gun from and no decision has been made whether to charge the 17-year-old as a juvenile or as an adult."}
