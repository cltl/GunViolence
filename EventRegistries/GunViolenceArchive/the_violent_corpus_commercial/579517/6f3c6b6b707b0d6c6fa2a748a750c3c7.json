The shooter was still at large.\nPolice were alerted to the shootings by the department\u2019s ShotSpotter system, Lt. Joe Gomez said. Officers found the female victim in the front yard. An officer found the 14-year-old when he stopped a car nearby. The other two victims were taken to a hospital by friends.\nGomez said it appeared the shootings happened at a house set up for a large event, possibly a graduation party. Inside the home, officers found a long table set up for beer pong, along with alcohol and a large number of plastic drinking cups.\nThere were many people on hand when officers arrived, and police called for additional help to begin interviews. Crime-scene unit investigators were brought in to see if any of the partygoers had gunshot residue on their clothes.\nGomez said it appeared the shooter or shooters opened fire after walking up to the party, then fled. As to a motive, the lieutenant said police were only beginning to investigate that. He said it could be gang retaliation, an angry ex-boyfriend or something else.\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d Gomez said.\nJim Guy: 559-441-6339, @jimguy27"}
