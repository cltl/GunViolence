He said, 'I got shot! I got shot!' I thought he was playing, then I saw the bullet wound in his arm,\" Johnson said.\n\"I felt bad because I couldn't help him. The guy just started shooting eight or nine times after that. he just shot through the whole party. Everyone was trying to run for dear life,\" Johnson added.\nJohnson hopped a rear fence to safety as the party erupted in mayhem and three of his friends were hit.\n\"I heard shots and firecrackers at the same time. Firecrackers had been bursting all night, then you'd hear, 'Boom!' It was chaos,\" said neighbor Vernon Wilson, 66.\n\"People were running into the back, trying to jump over the fence. It was a stampede,\" Wilson said.\nHe hit four men \u2014 ages 18, 18, 19 and 20 \u2014 and three women \u2014 17, 19 and 20, police said.\n\"I saw a guy around the corner on the ground who'd been shot. he was breathing, talking. He was sitting on the sidewalk,\" said Ted McQueen, 60, who owns the venue and rents it out regularly.\nAnother man was tending to the victim, asking him, \"Where you shot at?\" according to McQueen.\nIn the mayhem, people were desperately screaming, \"What happened?\" over an over, according to neighbor Rosie Smith, 23.\n\"One of the girls on a stretcher said, 'Mommy, a guy didn't get into the party.' Then they put her in an ambulance and took her away,\" Smith added.\n\"It was horrifying. These were just children,\" Smith said.\nThey were all treated at Brookdale and Kings County hospitals where they're listed in stable condition, police said.\nInvestigators are questioning a 21-year-old man who they consider a person of interest, a spokesman said.\nMcQueen regularly rents out the venue for parties and said the party was a joint graduation and Independence Day celebration."}
