He alerted the other hunters using a walkie-talkie.\nThe MCSO report said the hunting party members knew each other.\nThe report said the hunter who fired the shotgun was about 60 to 70 yards from the man who was hit.\nThe hunter who fired the shotgun called the incident a \"freak accident\" and said he \"shot the deer at an angle\" and thought one of the pellets must have bounced off something before the hunter was hit.\nA Marion County Fire Rescue unit responded, dressed the wound and offered to take the hunter to a hospital, but he declined.\nThe hunter who shot the deer reportedly left with it strapped to his truck."}
