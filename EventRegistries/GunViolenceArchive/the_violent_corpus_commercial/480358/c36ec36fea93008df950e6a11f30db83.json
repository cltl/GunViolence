I don't know all the details at this point.\"\nThe dad said the son fled the house soon after the shots were fired.\n\"We were asleep, we heard something, it sounded like a gunshot,\" the dad said. \"I don't know. I didn't want to get involved. ...I have not gone in his room. I don't know what's going on.\"\nndillon@nydailynews.com\nWith News Wire Services"}
