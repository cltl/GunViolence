During Bryson's preliminary examination on Tuesday, Judge Ronald Giles dropped all the charges except weapons altering.\nProsecutors say Bryson knew his 11-year-old son had an unhealthy obsession with guns. They say just days prior to the shooting death of 3-year-old Elijah Walker last month, he was caught shooting a gun.\nInvestigators say Bryson told them he stored the two guns in his locked bedroom at his home in the 16000 of Eastwood Street in Detroit. Detectives say the boy found the unsecured handgun and shot Elijah once in the face.\nOther adults were at the home at the time of shooting, but Bryson was not.\nThe Wayne County Prosecutor's Office charged the boy as a juvenile with manslaughter.\nCopyright 2015 by ClickOnDetroit.com.
