Neighbors say his younger brother pulled the trigger.\n\"It's just sad, it's just sad,\" said Denise, who did not want to give her last name but lives nearby.\nHis sister shared a picture with TODAY'S TMJ4 of 9-year-old Julian Clark, taken just a few days ago. Family members say his 6-year-old brother accidently shot him.\nThe owner of a nearby convenience store, Mohammad Alawneh, says he often saw them playing together.\n\"They come into the store here, very nice kids, very nice family,\" said Alawneh.\nPolice say it happened just before 4 p.m. Wednesday in their home near 20th and Hadley.\nNeighbors say Julian was shot through the shoulder. Some of the child's family members and neighbors wonder how the children got a gun.\n\"It a shame that parents don't even have lock boxes or anything for their guns to be put in a lock box...it's too many people getting killed out here,\" said Denise.\nThe man, who often serves the kids snacks, hopes to see the children again soon.\n\"I'm sorry about what happened, we feel bad you know,\" said Alawneh.\nA woman was taken from the home in handcuffs, but so far police say no one is facing charges for the shooting."}
