The boys' mother faces up to nine months in prison and up to $10,000 in fines.\nThe wounded boy, identified in the charging document as \"J.D.C,\" was shot by his brother, \"D.D.P.\" on Wednesday inside their home on the 2700 block of North 20th Street after the younger boy found the Kel-Tec 9mm on top of a kitchen cabinet.\nThe younger boy told police that he used a chair to climb the cabinet in the kitchen and found the gun, the complaint said. As he was holding the gun, his older brother placed his hands on his brother's hands and the gun went off.\nThe bullet hit J.D.C. in the neck and exited his back near the left shoulder blade, the complaint said.\nWhen first questioned, the boys' mother, Nicole Jackson, said the gun was hers and that she'd moved it from the bedroom to the kitchen earlier that day because she was cleaning the bedroom. She later admitted the weapon belonged to Phillips.\nPhillips in 2009 was convicted on felony drug charges and is not legally permitted to own a gun, court records show."}
