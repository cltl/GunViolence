When they arrived, officers found the victim in the driveway. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\nPolice say he got into an argument with someone before he was shot. Neighbors reported hearing a series of gunshots.\nFriends say Jones was turning his life around. He moved to Fort Worth a few years ago to go to school and play basketball.\n\"I want him to be remembered as a good man,\" said friend Robert Thornton.\nThornton and Jones would see each other daily to play pickup basketball in their neighborhood. The pair became best friends.\nThornton said he and Jones were together at a friend's birthday party a few hours before the shooting. Thornton walked home before midnight to go to bed.\nHe learned of Jones' death before church on Sunday morning.\n\"I don't see him as a friend. I see him as a brother,\" said Thornton. \"He was always there for me. It's my time to stand tall and be there for him, and keep going with my life.\"\nThornton's father, Reggie Walker, described Jones as a jokester and \"the life of the party.\"\n\"He had a smile that would light his whole face up. He was a real funny kid,\" said Walker. \"He wanted to work, he wanted to make money, he wanted his diploma, he wanted to be the first one in his family to get his high school diploma.\"\nThe suspect is still at large."}
