The coroner\u2019s office said he died from a gunshot wound to the head.\nKaiyana Rockingham told 24-Hour News 8 she saw her son in the hospital and believes there\u2019s more to what happened.\n\u201cThe first thing I said was no not Dewaun he didn\u2019t do this. He didn\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it took for me to go to the hospital and see his face and see the wound in his head to know that he didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nShe said her son Dewaun Rockingham was the light of her life.\n\u201cHe was the light when he\u2019s around.
