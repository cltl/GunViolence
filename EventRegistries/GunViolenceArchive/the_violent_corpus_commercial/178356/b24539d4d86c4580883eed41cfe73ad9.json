He had initially been transported to the McAlester Regional Health Center following the shooting, then transported by medical flight to the Tulsa hospital, according to the sheriff.\nAn investigation into the shooting is still open, but Kerns said that based on preliminary findings, it appears the shooting was an accident.\n\u201cSupposedly, the boys were playing with a high-powered pellet gun and one was shot in the temple,\u201d Kerns said.\nLaw enforcement officers aren\u2019t releasing the name of the individual allegedly holding the weapon when the shot was fired because that person is a juvenile, the sheriff said.\nFollowing completion of the investigation, a report will be turned over to the District 18 District Attorney\u2019s office, said Kerns.\nContact James Beaty at jbeaty@mcalesternews.com."}
