She heard some men talking about a gun, heard a gunshot and then felt a sharp pain in her leg, Hitt said.\nIt is unclear what exactly happened that led up to a gun being fired and it very well could have been fired accidentally, Hitt said.\nThe man fled the scene prior to police arrival and has still not been located, Hitt said.\nThe teen was transported to Henry Ford Alliance Health to be treated for minor injuries and is still undergoing treatment, Hitt said."}
