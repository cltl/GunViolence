Neighbors and community leaders said they are frustrated by the incident, which happened in broad daylight.\nTwo neighbors said the children were playing basketball at Owen Davis Park near their home when the incident happened.\n\u201cI heard the shooting. I was sitting in my living room and I heard about 10 shots,\u201d said neighbor Debura Alston. \u201cTwo little innocent boys got shot. It\u2019s a shame how easy these guns are to get to.\u201d\nAfter Alston heard the shots, neighbor Ronald Jackson said he saw one of the shooting victims running away from the park as he looked for help.\n\u201cI looked at one kid and he was shot in the arm,\u201d Jackson said.\nHenderson City Council member Melissa Elliot said the police chief contacted her after the incident and asked her to help find a solution to gun violence in the community.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the Boston cease fire method to do an initiative for people to drop their weapons,\u201d Elliot said.\nElliot represents the ward where the incident took place and works closely with youth there. She said the incident has robbed many children of their innocence.\n\u201cThey did not want to walk home today. I took four loads of children back home in my car because they were afraid of getting shot,\u201d she said."}
