People have speculated things but we don't know if we'll ever truly know why,\" Quinn said.\nThe family described Lee as quiet and disinterested but they never expected it would lead\n\"I want to see him pay for this. I want him to wake up every morning with that vision of what he did and I also want him to fry,\" Vega said.\nThe siblings are struggling to raise money for funeral and legal expenses because they have to bury their entire family.
