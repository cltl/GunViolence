Kimball High School in Dallas when students heard a gunshot.\n\"My nerves are still going,\" said Liberty Pena, who was in class at the time.\nPolice say a student brought a small derringer to class and had it in his pocket when it accidentally went off. Pena has several friends that were in the classroom at the time.\n\"They heard a pop while taking a test and they thought it was a balloon,\" Pena said. \"And all of a sudden blood started pouring on the floor and he dropped the revolver.\"\nThe student who brought the gun was shot in the leg and transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The district says the student arrived at school with the weapon for an unplanned meeting with administrators.\nStudents started texting and calling their parents, who rushed to the high school.\nRaymond Jeffery, who has a son at the school, was among some of the parents who went up to the school.\n\"They are supposed to be in the safest place besides a church,\" Jeffrey said. \"I don't understand.\"\nEva Alejandro got a text from her daughter.\n\"She said, 'Mom, I am in the gym. I am hiding. I'm scared but I'm safe,'\" Alejandro said.\nParents questioned how the gun got into the school in the first place and what the student was planning to do with it.\n\"I am wondering why was the gun brought to school?\" said Lashell Booker.\nDallas ISD police say the student arrived at the school with his mother. Other students had already gone through a metal detector. By that time, the machine had been pushed aside. The student walked in without being screened for a weapon.\n\"The metal detectors are monitored differently after school starts,\" said Dallas ISD Police Chief Craig Miller. \"The student in this instance came in with a parent for the meeting and it wasn't observed at that point.\"\nDallas ISD officials say they'll review what happened and will make changes to its safety plan if necessary.\nKimball H S Students posting this picture of gun inside classroom after student accidentally shoots himself. pic.twitter.com/7u14vzWU35\n\u2014 Rebecca Lopez (@rlopezwfaa) May 2, 2016\nCopyright 2016 WFAA"}
