Two victims were in critical, one was in serious, and the fourth victim had minor injuries.\n\u201cWhen officers arrived, they found multiple victims suffering from gun shot wounds, and there appeared to be a large disturbance in the area,\u201d said Sgt. Jeff Swanson, Wichita Police Department.\nPolice believe there was a large gathering going on. They\u2019re not sure if it was carried over from another location or if it was gang related.\nFormer business owners nearby say they\u2019re not surprised by the gathering and that this wouldn\u2019t be the first time.\n\u201cThere were a few people coming through breaking into cars, partying, and I was like okay,\u201d said Robert. \u201cI kept watching and sure enough there are after parties and all that stuff so I wouldn\u2019t doubt it.\u201d\nRobert adds, \u201cI truthfully hope they find out who did this just because it\u2019s not a bad area of town when all that elements is eliminated,\u201d said Robert. \u201cI like to see it eliminated and in fact I\u2019ll come back and rent again if it\u2019s all eliminated.\u201d\nSeveral cars were left behind at the crime scene. Police say at this time they\u2019re working to identify the owners of about 12 cars so they can talk to them to see if they know anything about what happened.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
