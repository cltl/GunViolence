The Meriwether County Sheriff\u2019s Office asked the task force last week to provide assistance with its investigation into the Sept. 27 shooting at the Hill Haven Event Center in Greenville, which is about 60 miles southwest of Atlanta.\nInvestigators believe a gambling dispute preceded several people pulling out guns and firing \u201cindiscriminate shots\u201d inside the crowded establishment, which had been rented out for a birthday party. Five women and five men were injured.\nThe event center had its business license revoked following the shooting, during which alcohol was reportedly on-site. County officials said the center did not have an alcohol license.\nThe exact charges filed against Norman were unclear. His arrest came a week after that of Tommie Thornton, a 22-year-old fellow suspect. Thornton was also arrested in LaGrange.\nAn exact number of potential suspects is unclear, but Meriwether County Sheriff Chuck Smith previously said that several arrests were expected.\nAll of the victims survived their injuries."}
