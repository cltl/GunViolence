One 6-year-old male was immediately airlifted to The Med-Memphis and was last reported to be in critical condition.\nTrying to make sense of the chaos at hand, were dozens of concerned residents and nearby neighbors, who quickly lined the streets surrounding the crime scene, offering both console and prayers for the families involved.\nOfficials of DPD stated that they are tentatively searching for up to three shooters involved in the incident.\nWhile the crime is currently under investigation by DPD, officers stated that roughly one and half hours before the shooting occurred, calls were received by the department reporting 1-2 cars that had driven through the area carrying individuals who were reportedly flashing guns.\nSubsequent traffic stops were made with officers finding no guns."}
