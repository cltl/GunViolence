They found two handguns, one of which is believed to be the murder weapon. Treasure Island police notified Pinellas Park police, who went to Rajic's condo and found his body.\nAlexandar was charged with second-degree murder and was booked into the Pinellas County Jail.\nAccording to an arrest affidavit, Alexandar went to the condo to confront Rajic about \"poisoning him for the past five years.\" When he spoke with Treasure Island police, he told them there was no sense checking on Rajic because \"I've shot him with a revolver.\"\nAlexandar told police the shooting was accidental, the affidavit said.\n(\u00a9 2017 WTSP)"}
