One person was fatally wounded,\u201d he said.\nPolice said it all started as an argument that apparently escalated, shortly after 6 a.m. \u201cThere are several different casings on the scene, different weapons,\u201d said Pimentel.\nOne man was pronounced dead at the scene. He was later identified as 24-year-old Michael Tito Lorenzo.\nParamedics rushed another male victim to Ryder Trauma Center in critical condition. The other two victims, a man and a woman, were transported in stable condition.\nA fifth male victim also required medical attention after breaking a leg while trying to jump a fence.\nCrime scene investigators combed the street for evidence and interviewed witnesses. \u201cWe do need the public\u2019s help, because obviously there were plenty of people out here,\u201d said Pimentel.\nIt is unclear if the club\u2019s cameras captured the shooting. People going in and out of the business after the scene had been cleared declined to comment on the incident.\nPimentel said there has been trouble at this club before. \u201cIt appears to have a bit of a history, as far as this place and violence of some sort,\u201d he said.\nPolice said the motive behind the shooting remains unclear. No arrests have been reported.\nIf you have any information on this shooting, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Remember, you can always remain anonymous, and you may be eligible for a $3,000 reward.\nCopyright 2017 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.
