He had no criminal record, she added.\nObeshaw recently moved to Taylor, police said. Family members told investigators he was a family friend who previously lived with the victims in Belleville, Sclabassi said. There was no evidence of a romantic tie between Obeshaw and Watson.\n\u201cLast night, witnesses told us Sharon and Emma were at the Sportsplex for regular soccer practice,\u201d the chief said. \u201cObeshaw had been seen at the beginning of practice, embracing the young girl. She embraced him back as if there were no problem.\u201d\nSclabassi said Obeshaw had been at Emma\u2019s soccer practices in the past.\nAfter soccer practice, investigators believe Obeshaw walked up to Watson and her daughter after they got into their vehicle and were preparing to leave. He fired a 9mm handgun multiple times, first hitting Watson and then Emma, Sclabassi said.\nSclabassi said the weapon was found near Obeshaw\u2019s body. Obeshaw legally obtained his handgun in September, the police chief said. Detectives don\u2019t know if he had the weapon with him when he was inside the facility, she added.\nBrian Jones, who was at the Taylor Sportsplex Friday, called the shooting \u201ca tragedy.\u201d Jones said he brings his children to play youth hockey from Nashville at least six times a year. He said he heard about the shooting last night while at his hotel.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a sign of the times.\u201d\nEmma and Watson are related to Bill Nowling, the former spokesman for Detroit Emergency Manager Kevin Orr. On Friday, Nowling posted a message on Facebook: \u201cIf you are a praying person, the Nowling and Watson families could use some today.\u201d\nSclabassi said the Taylor Sportsplex historically is a safe place.\n\u201cWe have no reason to believe this individual necessarily targeted the Sportsplex,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that s where Miss Watson and her daughter happened to be when this occurred.\u201d\nWatson is being treated at Beaumont Hospital in Dearborn, Sclabassi said. She also said Watson has some procedures to undergo, but will hopefully recover.\nSclabassi said Watson was informed Friday morning about her daughter\u2019s death. \u201cAs to what she\u2019s able to comprehend, I do not know,\u201d the chief said.\nA gofundme campaign has been established to help cover funeral costs for Emma Watson Nowling and medical expenses for her mother.\nAuthorities continue to investigate and anyone with information about the incident should call Taylor Police at (734) 287-6611.\ncramirez@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2058"}
