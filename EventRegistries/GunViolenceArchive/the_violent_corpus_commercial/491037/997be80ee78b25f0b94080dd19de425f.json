McKinney was convicted of attempted murder, felonious assault and felony use of a firearm. He remains in the Kent County Jail pending his sentencing April 29 before Judge Paul Sullivan.\nThe teens were at the July 14 graduation party on Farmview Court SE, north of 52nd Street SE near Breton Road, when rival gangs squared off, testimony showed.\nRelated: A punch to the mouth leads to gunfire, alleged attempted murder at Kentwood graduation party\nAccording to witnesses, between 150 and 200 people were at the party when a group of 10 or 12 young men showed up around 11:30 p.m. The newcomers, who were not invited, were members of the Bemis Boys street gang based in Southeast Grand Rapids, according to Chief Assistant Kent County Prosecutor Christopher Becker.\nAlready at the party were members of a suburban gang out of Kentwood.\nBecker told the jury that when the rival gang members showed up, the groups began arguing and that escalated to Dominique Hudson punching McKinney in the mouth, knocking him to the ground and chipping his tooth.\nAfter he was helped back on his feet, McKinney began shooting into the crowd and several people were struck by bullets, Becker said.\nParty-goer Mark Armstrong, who was struck in the stomach and the back, spent four days in the hospital. Another victim was struck in the face and a few others received minor injuries while scattering in the panic of gunfire.\nSome of the witnesses testified they either saw McKinney with the gun, saw him shooting into the crowd or saw Armstrong get shot.\nE-mail Barton Deiters: bdeiters@mlive.com and follow him on Twitter at twitter.com/GRPBarton or Facebook at facebook.com/bartondeiters.5"}
