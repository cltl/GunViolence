David Sicilian of the homicide squad told the Columbus Dispatch.\nAn injured woman was found outside the house when police arrived at 7:26 a.m. Saturday. It wasn't immediately disclosed whether her injuries, considered non-life threatening, related to the shooting spree. She was rushed to Grant Medical Center.\nSo far, police have not disclosed a possible motive or identified a suspect. The Dispatch reported a neighbor told police that a person \u2014 unclear whether it was a man or woman \u2014 was seen running from the house about 5:30 a.m.\n\"We obviously have a homicidal suspect out here who's not afraid to kill somebody. We need to quickly find out who that is or the persons responsible for this,\" Sicilian said."}
