Jackson was living on the base on Sept. 11, 2015, when he handled a loaded .22-caliber handgun recklessly and shot and killed Kenyon Givens Jr., Beall said. Prosecutors say Jackson originally told military police an armed, masked intruder forced his way into the home where the shooting occurred and fired at Givens, striking his chest. The false story prevented paramedics from treating Givens until after police had searched the house.\nInvestigators later learned Jackson had the gun and had spun the chamber while holding the trigger, causing it to discharge. He faces up to eight years in federal prison when he is sentenced Jan. 11.\nAmy Renee Leiker: 316-268-6644, @amyreneeleiker"}
