He then accidentally shot his 40-year-old grandmother through the passenger seat.\n\"She\u2019s probably lucky that it hit the car seat first because it slowed down the momentum of the bullet,\" said Rock Hill Police Captain Mark Bollinger.\nThe family was traveling through the light at Ogden Road and Heckle Boulevard when the woman heard the gun go off.\nShe looked in the back seat and the boy had the gun in both hands and began to cry. That's when the grandmother said she'd been hit by the bullet in the back.\n\"It was in a pouch behind the passenger seat, somehow the child reached in and got ahold of it, that\u2019s something our detectives are working on today,\" Bollinger said.\nThe woman reportedly drove to a family member's home along Stanley Drive and called police.\nThe grandmother was transported to Carolinas Medical Center-Main in Charlotte.\nThere was earlier confusion from police on the age of the boy and the relationship to the woman who was shot.\nInvestigators will turn over case findings to the solicitor\u2019s office for possible weapons or other charges.\n\"There could be some child neglect, or some unlawful conduct towards a child charges based on the age of the child and leaving the gun within reaching distance of a young minor,\" Bollinger said.\nWhile the injuries aren\u2019t believed to be life threatening, Bollinger says the incident is a reminder for parents to keep their guns locked and stowed away from children.\n\"We encourage people to get gun locks, we give them away free here at the Rock Hill Police Department,\" Bollinger said.\nFamily members and neighbors did not want to talk about what happened.\nThe case remains under investigation.\nCopyright 2015 WBTV.
