Powell said the young girl frequently came over to play in her yard. \"She's four years old,\" she said. \"She didn't even have a chance to live.\"\nPrice's grandmother told WAVE 3 News the gun involved in the incident belonged to a teenager who lives at the home but wasn't there at the time of the shooting.\nOfficials could not say where the gun was being kept or how the girl managed to get to it.\nLMPD spokesman Dwight Mitchell said other people were at the home when the girl was shot, but no one has been arrested. Any decision on potential charges, he said, would have to be made by the Commonwealth's Attorney's office.\nLast year, less than a mile from where Price was shot, a 4-year-old boy, Kamarion Posey, apparently shot himself in the head, suffering fatal injuries. He died at Kosair Children's Hospital on May 2, 2014. The homicide unit investigated that case, but no charges were filed.\nPowell said she is praying for Ilanye's mother, and she hopes the girl's death will serve as a reminder for others: \"Put your gun away.\"\nCopyright 2015 WAVE 3 News.
