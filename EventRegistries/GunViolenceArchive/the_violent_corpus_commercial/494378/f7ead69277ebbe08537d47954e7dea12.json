The dead included Dooley\u2019s father, Steven Todd Dooley, 50, a recently retired officer from the Chesapeake Police Department.\nThe incident began when Chesapeake police were called to a home in the 2300 block of Wildwood Road to check on the welfare of a person shortly after 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, police said. They discovered the suspect\u2019s brother, Landon Dooley, 22, dead inside.\nAn investigation led officers to a nearby home in the 1400 block of N. George Washington Highway around 7 p.m. Police negotiated with Cameron Dooley, who was armed, for several hours.\nOfficers later entered the home and found the suspect and other family members dead. They included the suspect\u2019s mother, Lori Dooley, 54; the suspect\u2019s sister, Brooke Dooley, 17; the suspect\u2019s father; and a fifth adult woman who has not been identified.\nPolice believe the relatives were killed before officers arrived at the scene. The case remains under investigation."}
