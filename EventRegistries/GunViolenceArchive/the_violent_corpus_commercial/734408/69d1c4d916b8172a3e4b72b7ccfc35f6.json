But the muzzleloader fired \u2014 ripping into his chest.\n\u201cI never in a gazillion years thought I\u2019d be in the ICU with my son,\u201d says his Mom, \u201choping he\u2019d just survive.\u201d\nHis dad \u2014 a retired Marine \u2014 stopped the teen\u2019s bleeding out in those woods, and a stranger at a nearby tree nursery used his tractor to clear a path for first responders.\nFortunately, the bullet missed Hunter\u2019s heart and a major artery, but it tore through his left lung and shattered his shoulder blade.\nDoctors haven\u2019t yet decided if they should try to remove the bullet fragments. That\u2019ll come later.\n\u201cYou survive off of everybody\u2019s prayers and love,\u201d his mother says.\nAnd there\u2019s been plenty of that. Friends have ferried in meals as the Richardson\u2019s keep a \u2019round the clock vigil at the hospital.\nBut the family has also been stung by the online venom of some people who have sarcastically jabbed Hunter for his lapse in judgment \u2014 even though the teen has owned it from the start.\n\u201cBefore he was sedated, he said he took responsibility for it,\u201d Lee Anna Richhardson laments. \u201cIt was his fault. He screwed up. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad person or irresponsible. He just made a mistake.\u201d\nState Environmental Police point to the incident as a somber reminder for all hunters to always make sure the muzzle of their rifles is pointed in a safe direction.\nNow, Lee Anna Richardson says she\u2019d much rather focus on her son\u2019s recovery, and the GoFundMe page aimed at helping out with the mounting medical bills.\n\u201cIf you would be kind enough to donate that would be wonderful,\u201d she says. \u201cIf not, a prayer works just as well.\u201d\nAt this point, it\u2019s baby steps for Hunter, as he faces at least two weeks in the ICU \u2014 and a long recovery.\nFollow\nFollow Ken on Twitter Ken MacLeod is a general assignment reporter and substitute anchor at WBZ-TV News.
