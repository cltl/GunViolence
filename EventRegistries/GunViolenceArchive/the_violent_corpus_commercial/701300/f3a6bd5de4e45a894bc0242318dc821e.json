(KOIN) \u2014 Cassie Wilson died of a gunshot wound in South Salem last Thursday. Her death is officially being called an accident, but her family thinks her history as a domestic abuse victim had something to do with it.\n\u201cI\u2019m sad that we lost my sister,\u201d Batisse Wilson told KOIN 6 News. \u201cI\u2019m pissed that this is a domestic violence situation that she never reported to the police.\u201d\nBatisse said Cassie confided in her family about being abused by the man she lived with for about 8 years, a man who \u2014 Batisse said \u2014 has previouos domestic violence convictions.\nCassie and her partner were together in their apartment when the gun went off. The 29-year-old was shot in the abdomen, and before she died she told police she was handling the gun went it went off accidentally.\nBatisse said Cassie was not a gun person, but she purchased the weapon at her boyfriend\u2019s repeated request. As a convicted felon, he\u2019s not allowed to buy a gun himself.\nAccidental death or otherwise, the Wilson family believes her abusive situation is what led to her death.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. The gun was there. She was not trained. She was a novice,\u201d Batisse said. \u201cIt was a repressive situation and if you\u2019re not comfortable with something in your home you need to get out.\u201d\nShe added it\u2019s a situation that has been seen time and time again: \u201cThe outcome from domestic violence is somebody dies.\u201d\nCassie had a twin sister who died at childbirth.
