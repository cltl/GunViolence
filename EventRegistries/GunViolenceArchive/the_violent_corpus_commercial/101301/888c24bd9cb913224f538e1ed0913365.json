Tips can be texted to RMPOL (76765). Include the word \"crimes\" in the message.\nThe church held a community information session and prayer vigil Tuesday at noon, and was planning a public forum on gun and gang violence and other related issues. That forum has yet to be scheduled.\nIn a statement, church leaders said the teens were not church members, but that the public courts were provided as a safe place to play for for the community.\n\"It is regrettable to us as a faith community that this trust has been violated. We are actively ministering to every family involved and are continuing to work closely with these families, law enforcement and city officials,\" the church's statement said."}
