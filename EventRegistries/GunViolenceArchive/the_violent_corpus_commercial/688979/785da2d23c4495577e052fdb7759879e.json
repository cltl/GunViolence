And community leaders say while the neighborhood has improved over the years, seeing things like this are still troubling.\n\"They want to do what they want to do, that's alright. But when people get shot, that's a tragedy,\" said Rev. Ronald Taylor.\nHe serves as pastor of Beulah Missionary Baptist Church located right next to the scene of the shooting.\nHe wants whoever fired the shots to know they're not only impacting the lives of the victims, but also those of family members.\n\"That's somebody's daughter, somebody's son,\" said Taylor. \"Somebody's child got shot last night. I don't care who you are, somebody's going to feel the pain of that.\"\nAfter Sunday's shooting, these community leaders hope the neighborhood can come together to put an end to violence like this.\nDetectives say they don't have any motives or leads on a suspect at this point. If you have any information you're asked to call Crime Stopper at (419) 255-1111."}
