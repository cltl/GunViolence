But on Friday night, he went to a party and lost his life.\nHe invited his friend, Noah Jones, to come too.\n\u201cHe was just going to have a good time,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd something just went wrong.\u201d\nPolice said an argument broke out during an unsanctioned party at Studio 74, leading to a gunfight just after midnight.\nThe studio\u2019s owner, Laura Reyna, said no one was authorized to be there that night.\nDarryl Scott lives right across the street from the nonprofit dance studio. He said he heard multiple gun shots.\n\u201cI just heard the shots going off, and I heard the people yelling and screaming, burning rubber, going away,\u201d he said.\nPolice said the shooting was possibly gang-related. They\u2019ve identified more than one suspect.\nAt least five people were taken to the hospital. Two others died: Larkin and Treavon Lewis, 22\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a friend, he\u2019s a brother to me,\u201d Noah said in tears.\nLarkin\u2019s friends say they believe he was innocent, and that he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. They wanted to be with their teacher as they tried to make sense of the loss.\n\u201cWe all loved Jordan so much,\u201d Russell said. \u201cHe made us laugh -- and he\u2019s still making us laugh. He loved life, he really did.\u201d"}
