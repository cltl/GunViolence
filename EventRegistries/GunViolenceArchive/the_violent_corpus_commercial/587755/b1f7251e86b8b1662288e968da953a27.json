Lancaster Avenue, and wasn\u2019t authorized to be there.\n\"Nobody was supposed to be here last night,\" said Reyna. \"I was in shock and awe when I got a call.\"\nReyna said Studio 74 is a non-profit dance hall, seven years in the making, aimed at celebrating hip hop culture, serving as a creative outlet, and teaching young people to dance.\n\"We run this place as a family. My kids have built this up,\" said Reyna, through tears.\nAn argument inside Studio 74 dance hall spilled out into the streets just after midnight Saturday, according to investigators.\nAccording to Fort Worth Police, shots were fired as a man tried to run out of the building. Then, investigators say an unknown number of people started shooting at each other outside the building and from across the street.\nThe two killed were identified as Treavon Lewis, 22, and Jordan Larkin, 18, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner\u2019s website.\nJason Moore, who helps take care of the building, said he helped let the group inside around 10 p.m Friday night, without realizing they apparently never signed a contract.\n\"They were charging at the door like it was a legit thing, they had a metal detector at the door and everything,\" said Moore.\nHe also said a DJ brought his own speakers and equipment.\nAt one point, Moore heard multiple gunshots outside, and saw chaos inside.\n\"I saw a dude up here that was struggling with a gun,\" said Moore.\nFWPD said it was called at 12:28 a.m. When officers arrived four minutes later, the shooters had fled the scene.\nThere were no immediate details available on a suspect. Homicide detectives and officers from FWPD's gang unit were investigating to see if the shooting was gang-related.\nA Studio 74 dance performance scheduled for Saturday night in Plano would go on as planned, said Reyna.\n#FWPD says a disturbance inside the Studio 74 dance hall spills outside where 6 people were shot. 2 victims died. pic.twitter.com/jAONFAPy3U\n\u2014 Mike Forbes (@mikeforbeswfaa) June 25, 2016\nOn Facebook, Studio 74 posted a statement Saturday morning: \u201cTo all studio family, fans and supporters, first I would like to thank all of you for the calls, concerns and prayers that have been sent my way.
