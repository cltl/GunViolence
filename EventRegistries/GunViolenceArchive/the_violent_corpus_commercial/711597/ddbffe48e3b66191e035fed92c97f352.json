Louisiana State Police detained Manuel without incident. Officials say he will be extradited to New Orleans to face charges of second degree murder and nine counts of attempted murder.\nAuthorities arrested the first Lafayette Parish man on a count of second-degree murder in Sunday's shooting on Bourbon Street that left one man dead and nine injured.\nSt. Martin Parish officials took Jordan Clay, 20, into custody in Breaux Bridge, said New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison.\nClay, who has a pending court case in Lafayette Parish on one count of possessing a stolen firearm, will be extradited to New Orleans to face prosecution.\nHarrison said authorities are \"aggressively\" searching for a second suspect from the Lafayette area, although that person's name has not been released. Both Clay and the second suspect had been in New Orleans for the annual Bayou Classic football game between Grambling State and Southern Universities.\nHarrison said the Lafayette suspects were out-of-towners with no affiliation with either university. Authorities believe Clay and the victim had known each other for a while and had an \"ongoing dispute.\"\nDemontris Toliver, 25, of New Orleans, died in the early Sunday shooting, while nine others suffered life-threatening injuries. Toliver's father appeared in tears beside New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and law enforcement authorities during a Friday morning press conference.\nNew Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he's meeting with law enforcement officials to discuss how to better address gun violence issues.\n\"This is a systemic problem that requires a robust response,\" not only in New Orleans, but throughout the state and country, Landrieu said.\nHundreds of thousands of people had descended upon New Orleans over the weekend for the Bayou Classic, Saints game and the Thanksgiving holiday, Landrieu said.
