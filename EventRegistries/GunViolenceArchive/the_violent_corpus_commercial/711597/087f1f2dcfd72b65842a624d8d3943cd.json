According to Toliver's Facebook page, he attended NOCCA and O. Perry Walker High School.\n\"Demontris Toliver did what any other 25 year old from New Orleans does on Thanksgiving, or their birthday--or on Mardi Gras or Jazzfest or for a family event--he came home. It was during this most banal and simple of acts that Demontris was shot and killed on Bourbon Street early Sunday morning, guilty of nothing besides wanting to come home to celebrate,\" said a statement from NOCCA CEO, Kyle Wedberg.\n\"My thoughts and prayers, and those of the NOCCA Community, go out to the family of Demontris Toliver. Those thoughts and prayers are also for all of us in this community as there is one less artistic voice, one less difference-maker in our midst.\"\nPhotos on Toliver's public Instagram page showed drawings and paintings the young man created.\nA photo posted by \ud83d\udca1DEMONT (@_demontt82) on\nMar 20, 2016 at 4:31am PDT\nToliver is the lone fatality as of Sunday afternoon in the mass shooting that wounded nine other people.
