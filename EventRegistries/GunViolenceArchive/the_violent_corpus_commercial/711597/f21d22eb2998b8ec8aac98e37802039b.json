I got hit in my chest and I got hit in my fingers. It knocked one of my fingers off my hand.\"\nSingleton was New Orleans for the busy Bayou Classic weekend.\nWhen he was heading back to his hotel early Sunday, gunfire erupted in the 100 block of Bourbon Street.\n\"I did hear the gunshots. That's why I turned and started running,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cI think it was a little too late because as soon as I turned, I got shot. As I was turning, I was getting shot. I think it was a little too late. I actually pushed my friend out of the way so he wouldn't get shot either.\"\nPolice said 10 people were wounded. One of the victims was killed.\n\"All the police started gathering, getting everybody,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cThey actually had three other people surrounding me that was, like, on the ground. I think one of them had got shot in the neck and the other one had got shot in the leg and it broke his leg. He couldn't really get up.\"\nSingleton works in LaPlace at an oil refinery and enjoys amateur boxing.\n\"(I'm not) getting my fingers back because they were (blown) off, so it's just reality set in,\u201d Singleton said.\nHe said doctors were able to repair his fingers, but they won\u2019t be the same. The tips of the two fingers that were hit are gone.\nDetectives said two men got into an argument and opened fire. None of the victims who were injured in the crossfire were intended targets.\nSingleton wants the gunmen to come forward and hopes to return to some sort of normalcy soon.\n\"I don't think it will be difficult,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cI'm up for any challenges. I'm going to go see after a few months how this is going to work. I'm going to start back exercising, start back training, start doing things I thought I couldn't do. So I am going to find out on my own, eventually.\"\nSingleton said he will never visit New Orleans during Bayou Classic again.\nAnyone with information about the case is asked to call Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111.\nKeep up with local news, weather and current events with the WDSU app here.
