Decouite also admitted he held the boy's feet under hot water until his skin started to burn, prosecutors said.\nThe boy's mother, Kiana Mohansing, 20, told officials that she had seen Decouite force his son to kneel on LEGO blocks for hours, put his son's hand under hot water until it burned, snuff cigarettes on the boy's arm and shoot him with a BB gun in the foot three times, according to prosecutors.\nThe pair was arrested Sunday after the child\u2019s grandmother called police to report the abuse, according to the NYPD.\nDr. Teresa Lemma, an expert cited in the criminal complaint against Decouite and Mohansing, confirmed injuries consistent with abuse. Lemma described multiple signs of burns and bruises on the boy, and noted that his hand is permanently scarred and had limited mobility. There was also scarring and bruising on his knees.\nPolice also said the boy had BB pellets lodged underneath the skin of his right leg and foot and that he appeared malnourished.\nDecouite and Mohansing were charged with multiple counts of assault, endangering the welfare of child and criminal possession of weapon.\n\u201cThis is a heartbreaking situation and we are working with law enforcement authorities to investigate,\u201d officials with the Administration for Children's Services said in a statement.
