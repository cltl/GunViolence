Reddick as the suspect in the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old male last Thursday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for the perpetrator, Lawrence D. Reddick Jr., of Aliquippa, for criminal homicide. He is armed and dangerous,\u201d Beaver County District Attorney David Lozier announced Monday.\nWhile Reddick remains on the run, police say they did arrest two 17-year-old males Monday evening in connection with the shooting. Investigators say they were co-conspirators, and are being charged as adults.\nThe victim, 16-year-old William Cade Booher, from Beaver, was shot and killed on Wade Street in Aliquippa.\nA 13-year-old passenger told police he came to Aliquippa with Booher and the driver, Dane Mathesius from New Brighton, to sell marijuana. He says they picked up Reddick and were ready to make the sale, when he pulled out a gun and demanded money and the drugs.\nPolice say Reddick then shot Booher several times in the head.\n\u201cWhen a senseless tragedy like this occurs, it\u2019s a sock in the stomach to all those fighting to change the image of this city,\u201d Aliquippa Police Chief Don Couch said.\nPolice were able identify Reddick through video surveillance and witness statements. They believe two guns were involved and one is still missing.\nThe two young men who were arrested are being held in the Beaver County Jail. Their identities have not yet been released.\nAfter the shooting, the 13-year-old passenger ran to a neighbor\u2019s house for help. Police say Mathesius also got out and ran. They are worried because he hasn\u2019t been since."}
