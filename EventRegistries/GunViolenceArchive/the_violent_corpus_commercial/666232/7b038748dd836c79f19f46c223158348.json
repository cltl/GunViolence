Officers found a car parked in the middle of the street riddled with bullet holes and Booher's body inside.\nInvestigators said they believe that the 13-year-old, Mathesius and Booher came to Aliquippa to sell marijuana and picked up Reddick, who officers said pulled a gun, demanded money and shot Booher in the head several times after he handed over $50. Police said they recovered a gun from the scene.\nAccording to a criminal complaint, Reddick, Foster and Jones conspired to rob Booher of marijuana and money outside Plan Twelve Market. Police said Mathesius and Reddick set up the deal, citing phone records that showed they were in contact with each other just before the shooting.\n\u201cWhen a senseless tragedy like this happens, it\u2019s a sock in the stomach,\u201d Couch said.\n\u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group."}
