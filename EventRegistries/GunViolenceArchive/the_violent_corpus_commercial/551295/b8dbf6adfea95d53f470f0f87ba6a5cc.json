Neither he nor the teen, Cheyanne Green, of Montpelier, knew the other was hunting from the same field.\nPolice said Noack left his blind and walked toward some turkeys along the edge of some woods. He positioned himself behind a tree and as the turkeys were entering the woods, he took a shot with a 12-gauge shotgun. Green was 70 to 80 yards away from Noack inside her blind at the time, just inside the wood line.\nPolice and the Vermont Fish and Wildlife, Enforcement Division are investigating.\nCopyright Associated Press"}
