Officers arrived to find the girl alive with gunshot wounds to her chest and face.\nOfficers found the boy between the apartment complex where he lived and a charter high school. He was dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot to the head. A handgun was recovered.\nThe Anoka County sheriff's office says the girl told detectives she was shot while the boy was \"playing\" with the gun, and she doesn't believe the shooting was intentional. She's hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.\nThe boy's mother was present and is cooperating with investigators.\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
