Paul Sommer with the Anoka County Sheriff\u2019s Office said 15-year-old Alantae Arnold shot his girlfriend Monday afternoon with a .357 Magnum at the apartment building where he lived. Immediately after, the teen ran to a nearby school parking lot and shot himself in the head.\nInitially, authorities thought that Arnold had assaulted his girlfriend.\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual in a firearms accident that someone would flee the scene and commit suicide,\u201d Sommer said.\nThe shooting left the 14-year-old victim with wounds in her chest and head. Police say she was lying down when she was hit by one bullet. It struck her chest and then hit her in the jaw, becoming lodged behind her ear. She is expected to be OK.\nThe girl told authorities that Arnold was \u201cplaying\u201d with the gun when he accidentally shot her.\n\u201cIn her opinion, it was not an intentional act,\u201d Sommer said.\nPolice are investigating how Arnold got the weapon. Sommer said he likely didn\u2019t get it through any legitimate means, and that his mother didn\u2019t get it for him. He added that she didn\u2019t know he had the gun.\nSommer said that if Arnold\u2019s mother had been aware of what he was posting on Facebook, she might have been able to take action. He also encouraged all parents to tune in to what their children are posting on social media.\nImages Arnold\u2019s Facebook account showed the teen with a gun. However, the gun pictured in those photos wasn\u2019t the one recovered from Monday\u2019s shooting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different type of weapon, completely different type of gun,\u201d Sommer said.\nCurrently, police say they don\u2019t know how Arnold got access to the gun in the Facebook photo. They also said that no other guns were found in a search of the teen\u2019s home.\nPolice said they can only speculate as to why Arnold took his own life following the accident."}
