Neal said Arnold accidentally shot her.\nShe survived. He left the home and took his own life.\nNeal\u2019s mother, Micki, told WCCO, in an exclusive interview, that this was a wake-up call for her, and she hopes it serves as a warning for other parents.\n\u201cThis has been extremely tough,\u201d Micki Neal said.\nNeal calls the past few months some of the most trying of her life.\n\u201cI could\u2019ve lost my daughter, and I\u2019m really grateful that she\u2019s okay,\u201d Neal said.\nAccording to the investigative report, Neal and Arnold were lying on his bed, when she says he accidentally shot her.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t know what was wrong,\u201d Neal said. \u201cShe knew she was bleeding here and she could hardly hear and everything was getting fuzzy.\u201d\nArnold\u2019s mom was home and frantically called 911, telling a dispatcher her son is crying, and she needs an ambulance.\n\u201cShe\u2019s shot!\u201d his mother said.\nArnold fled the Winchester Place Apartments. Police swarmed the property and later found him in a wooded area not far from his apartment. He had shot himself in the head, the gun still in his right hand.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine how it was for him,\u201d Neal said.\nWCCO obtained the investigative report into the shooting; family members interviewed described a troubled teenager. Arnold\u2019s grandmother said he skipped school frequently and was scheduled to be in court the same week as the shooting for stealing his principal\u2019s iPad.\nShe claims Arnold acted out and at one point choked his mother.\nHis mother told police Arnold was diagnosed with ADHD and was seeing a counselor who called him \u201ca juvenile delinquent\u201d who would hopefully grow out of it. She said she did not keep guns in the home.\nWCCO uncovered the .357 magnum used was stolen from a Coon Rapids home, where Arnold and Neal attended a party a few nights before. That theft remains under investigation.\nOn Facebook, two pictures of Arnold holding a gun surfaced shortly after the shooting. Police say the guns Arnold is holding are different weapons.\nWCCO discovered his dad saw the pictures \u201cfour to five months before the shooting.\u201d\nAccording to his statement, he confronted Arnold about the picture on Facebook. He said Arnold \u201cswore up and down it was fake. He was just doin\u2019 it to \u2026 take a picture and \u2026 it was a BB gun.\u201d\nMicki Neal also found the pictures and learned her daughter had seen them before the shooting. It left her feeling she failed as a parent.\n\u201cIt sickens me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me feel guilty.\u201d\nAnd she learned more about her own daughter and what she was into.\n\u201cI think marijuana,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the kids got together and sometimes drank.\u201d\nShe said she looked the other way when her daughter began isolating herself, being stand-offish and was always tired. The shooting made her realize she needs to be a more active participant in her daughter\u2019s life.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t get into her Facebook page,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get into her phone. We know who they\u2019re talking to, the parents, talking to the friends or the boyfriends but not just talking to them but getting to know them.\u201d\nNeal\u2019s injuries kept her in the hospital for four days. Surgery treated her wounds but more healing is needed. Micki Neal said doctors diagnosed her daughter with PTSD and the emotional scars linger.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still going to be dealing with this for years down the line, as well as his family,\u201d she said.\nShe said after the shooting, she found her daughter was once again hanging out with a teenager with a gun. When she learned that, she realized there was much more work to be done. The family has moved out of state and is going through counseling."}
