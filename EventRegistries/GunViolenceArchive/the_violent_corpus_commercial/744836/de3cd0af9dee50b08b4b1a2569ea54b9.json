He said give me your cell phone,\u201d said Buckley.\nThe security guards were a mom and son. According to Buckley, the son was the one who shot the two. Both were pronounced dead on scene.\nPolice have identified the 29-year-old man killed as Seth Easley. The identity of the 14-year-old boy also killed has not yet been released.\nAccording to Buckley, the 14-year-old was the one who allegedly pulled the gun on the security guards. He said the gun was loaded and reported stolen from Greenwood. He said Easley did not have a gun on him.\nNobody else was injured, but police say situations like this put the whole community at risk.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody to die during a robbery, I mean that is not the sentence for robbery, death, but if you do a robbery things like this can happen to the person doing the robbing, to the other person, to somebody just in the neighborhood,\u201d said Captain Robert Mercuri of the Beech Grove Police Department.\nDoug Pettigrew, the owner of the bar, said that the security guards had noticed the 14-year-old and Easley acting suspiciously before they approached the vehicle.\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned my security did their job,\u201d said Pettigrew. \u201cNothing happened in here which is what we\u2019re after.\u201d\nBoth security guards were interviewed by detectives and released. Detectives will meet with prosecutors in the coming days. The mayor says charges in this case are unlikely.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
