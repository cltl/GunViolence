Several others were in the room at the time, according to police, who said they responded to the 300 block of East Weidman Street at 11:38 p.m. after a witness saw the teen placed in a van.\nOfficers stopped the van near the scene and found the victim with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh, police said. He was rushed to a local hospital with what appeared to be non-life threatening injuries.\nCoward was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, five counts of recklessly endangering another person and receiving stolen property.\nThe victim told investigators he was shot in the 100 block of East Scull Street, police said. However, investigators said they learned he was one of several people in the room when the gun fired and the bullet struck him.\nPolice obtained a warrant and during a search of the house they said they found a handgun matching the one that fired during the incident. It was determined the gun had been stolen.\nCoward's arrangement is pending."}
