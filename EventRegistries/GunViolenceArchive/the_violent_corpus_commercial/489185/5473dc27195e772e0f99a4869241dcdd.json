College St. across the street from where the shooting occurred. He said the men who were shot went across the street to confront the suspected shooter about derogatory remarks one of the victims had said the suspect had made about the victim\u2019s grandmother.\nZelis, who had stayed behind, said he looked out the apartment window and saw the suspect come out of a home and begin firing a pistol. Zelis said he could see muzzle flashes.\n\u201cThere was at least seven or eight shots that went off,\u201d Zelis said. \u201cEverybody was scooting, and people were dropping.\u201d\nZelis said the four victims ran back to the apartment.\nAn approximately 4-by-2-inch spot of blood was outside the apartment complex.\nAccording to McCloskey, a 9 mm handgun and eight spent shell casings were recovered at the scene.\nNeighbor Greg Thomas, who lives in the apartment complex, said he was surprised by the violence.\n\u201cThis is Oberlin. That\u2019s not supposed to happen,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing I would\u2019ve expected.\u201d\nWoodings was arraigned this morning in Oberlin Municipal Court, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges, and a personal bond of $5,000 was set.\nAccording to the prosecutor, each of the alleged victims has a significant criminal history, including crimes of violence. The Oberlin Municipal Court docket states that Woodings was at his home, and it appeared that the alleged victims were trespassing and that at least one of the victims was told not to be at his home.\nWoodings was in the process of obtaining a Civil Protection Order against one of the victims before the shooting, according to court documents.\nWoodings\u2019 written statement said he was prompted to use his gun before he was harmed by one of the alleged victims.\nshow"}
