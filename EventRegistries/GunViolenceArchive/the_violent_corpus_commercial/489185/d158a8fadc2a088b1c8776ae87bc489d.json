One of the men was grazed in the head by a bullet.\nWoodings\u2019 attorney Edward La Rue did not return a call for comment on Thursday, but he had previously indicated that Woodings was harassed by the alleged victims before and after the shooting.\nWoodings was in the process of obtaining a civil protection order against one of the victims, and a search warrant filed in Lorain County Court of Common Pleas indicated that one of the alleged victims, Jackson, had been threatening Woodings for weeks leading up to the shooting.\nPolice said the threats involved money that Jackson\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Brelan Stevens, owed to Woodings.\nJackson denied going to Woodings\u2019 apartment with the intention of confronting Woodings, but La Rue said a group of men were standing outside of the parking lot of Woodings\u2019 apartment prior to the shooting.\nContact Chelsea Miller at 329-7123 or cmiller@chroniclet.com.
