Henderson was arrested Tuesday night for his role in the early Sunday morning incident, Harrisburg police spokeswoman Paula Trovy confirmed Wednesday morning.\nHenderson is being charged as an adult, Trovy said, and is facing a charge of conspiracy to commit criminal homicide. Other charges include seven counts of simple assault, seven counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, seven counts of reckless endangerment, possession of a firearm without a license, and possession of a firearm when prohibited.\nPolice said Tuesday that there were eight victims in the shooting. They all suffered non-life threatening injuries and were treated at local hospitals.\nOnly seven counts of simple assault, aggravated assault and reckless endangerment were filed against Henderson because one of the victims in the case is not cooperating with police, Trovy said.\nPolice said they believe a fight that occurred at a youth party led to the shooting around 1 a.m. Sunday. Residents in the area said they heard as many as 12 gunshots. Trovy said police continue to investigate the incident.\nHenderson was arraigned at 10 p.m. Tuesday and transported to Dauphin County Prison. His bail was set at $500,000.\nHe has a preliminary hearing scheduled for Oct. 25 in Dauphin County Court.\nView Larger Map"}
