Another man in his late 50s was shot in the arm, but he is expected to be OK, according to police.\nAt least 14 shell casing markers could be seen in the area of Northwest 17th Avenue and 31st Street, Tuesday night.\nJust before 8:45 p.m., Tuesday, City of Miami Police and Fire Rescue responded to the scene after reports of a teen being shot multiple times in the back. According to friends and family, two boys were walking back from a nearby McDonald\u2019s when they were confronted by two males. Both suspected gunmen began to open fire at the victims, one being 16-year-old Damien Ramirez.\nPolice said a man in his late 50s, unrelated to the two boys, was also struck in the arm.\n\u201cMy husband actually ran on the scene,\u201d said one witness. \u201cHe did see him on the floor. He did see him move a little bit. His little brother was there, concerned.\u201d\nBoth boys, including Ramirez, were rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital in critical condition. Ramirez died as a result of his injuries, late Tuesday evening.\n\u201cHe was very polite, such a good boy,\u201d said family friend Elsie Figueroa. \u201cHe lived with his grandmother. My granddaughter was consoling her.\u201d\nPolice believe the man in his 50s may be homeless, and neighbors told 7News he is blind. \u201cCompletely blind,\u201d said Figueroa. \u201cI used to bring him lunch, and I used to run around the corner just to bring him something to eat.\u201d\nA local business owned by Oseles Romero is undergoing repairs due to the gunfire. Romero\u2019s business is located on the corner of the street, near the scene.\n\u201cNow, this is a big problem for me,\u201d said Romero. \u201cI have to change now the glass. I don\u2019t know what happens now.\u201d\nPolice have since began their review of nearby surveillance video to try and identify the shooter or shooters. A gun was also discovered by investigators, Wednesday morning, a few houses away from the shooting. Officials have not confirmed whether the gun is related to the shooting.\nMultiple people fled in different directions when police arrived on scene, according to officials. No arrests have been made, but officials believe the shooter may be a teenager, as well.\nMeanwhile, Ramirez\u2019s family is devastated and begging for answers, the day before Thanksgiving.\nIf you have any information on this shooting, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS.
