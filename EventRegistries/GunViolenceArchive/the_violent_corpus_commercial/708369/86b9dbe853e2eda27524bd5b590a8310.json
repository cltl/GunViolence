A bystander, who was not related to the victims, was struck once in the arm.\nThe teenager, identified as Damien Ramirez, was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital in critical condition. He was pronounced dead a short time later.\n\"Five bullets hit him,\" Figueroa said. \"I don't know if they know who did it (or) why they did it, but he was not into gangs. He was not into drugs. He was a good 16-year-old boy.\"\nThe person who was shot in the arm was also taken to JMH in stable condition and is expected to make a full recovery.\nMiami-Dade County Public Schools superintendent Alberto Carvalho called out to the community to come forward with information about the shooting. He said there is no excuse for violence in the community to continue.\n\"We've lost dozens of kids, school-aged kids, over the past few years to gun violence and it must stop,\" he said.\nOur community, once again, grieves over the senseless shooting of a 16-year old child in Miami. Stop the cowardly code of silence. #Enough\n\u2014 Alberto M.
