But on the side, Mata worked as a psychic medium, running a website called SpiritualClairvoyanceChanneling.com.\nThere, Mata advertises his services as a spiritual guide who can create a \u201cspirit connection with a loved one on the Other Side,\u201d a gift he claims to have received during the passing of Pope John Paul II in 2005. Two e-books authored by \u201cRev. Mark Mata\u201d are available on Amazon.\nSan Diego police say that career ended Tuesday when he fatally shot his 42-year-old wife Min Huang and 6-year-old son Hank Mata, a first grader at Sundance Elementary School.\nOfficers did a welfare check on their Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos house after a concerned friend reported the family had not been heard from in two days. When officers looked through the back window, they saw Huang\u2019s body downstairs.\nThey then discovered Mata\u2019s and Hank\u2019s bodies in an upstairs bedroom. All three had suffered gunshot wounds to their upper bodies.\n\"It\u2019s terrible to see a child be killed because they have a whole life ahead,\u201d said neighbor Laura Sundquist. \u201cWho knows what their life would have been. So that\u2019s very tragic.\u201d\nNext to Mata\u2019s truck, which hasn\u2019t moved in days, friends laid a bouquet of flowers, stopping by Wednesday to pay their respects.\nNeighbor Cary Monroe told NBC 7 she is making sure her child know she loves her as they try to wrap their minds around what happened.\n\u201cI think everyone in the neighborhood is upset and appalled by this event. I\u2019ve called her a couple times to tell her how much I love her,\u201d said Monroe.\nMany residents said they did not know the victims, who lived in the home for about three years.\nAt this time, investigators are not releasing any information about a possible motive for the killings or whether a suicide note was found."}
