Pow, pow. Like automatic going off, like they shot seven or eight times,\u201d Mason told Elliot.\nhttps://twitter.com/RElliotWSB/status/653740572486860801\nDeKalb police only have a vague description of the suspect and aren't sure how he made his getaway, but they are vowing to find the man who fired into a crowd of people that included a small child.\n\u201cThis is a serious issue when you have an individual who is willing to take a shot and hit and shoot indiscriminately into a group of people and hit a child. That is something that the DeKalb police is really not going to tolerate,\u201d said Detective Corneilus Yarbro with the DeKalb County Police Department.\nTwo men and a woman were taken to a local hospital with non life-threatening injuries."}
