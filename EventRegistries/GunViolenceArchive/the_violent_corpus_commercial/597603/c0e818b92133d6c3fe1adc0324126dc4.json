He said they opened fire on his little brother and sister \"over a shirt.\"\n\"I just can't comprehend that,\" he said. \"Something that's replaceable, you know? Something that gets thrown out after some time.\"\nThe two had \"big hearts,\" family members said. Their sister-in-law Tilaima Lomu said she'll remember them as \"happy, very loud, cheerful\" people, two of the three youngest of nine siblings.\nAbril Izazaga was \"so smart,\" Lomu said, frequently bringing home A's from Hillcrest High School.\n\"She just had her quince [quincea\u00f1era] last year,\" Lomu said. \"Jose was going to turn his life around.\"\nJose Izazaga had been shot before, Lomu said, and she believed that on Wednesday night, Abril tried to protect him from that happening again.\nTheir grandmother, Guillermina Serrano, said in Spanish that the two teens were good, respectful children, as she sobbed alongside family members.\nTheir mother's cousin, Marisol Salinas, said in Spanish while fighting back tears that when her own son died, Jose Izazaga made her feel loved, like she wasn't alone. On her son's birthday, she said these teens were always the first ones there.\nShe said God is the only one who knows what happened Wednesday night, but she hopes justice will be served for the person who shot her family members, so no one else will be hurt.\nThe children's mother, Salinas said, has been torn up about the whole thing, and did not want to speak to media outlets Thursday.\nUPD said that anyone wishing to donate to the family may do so at any Wells Fargo Bank, under an account called: Benefit Memorial Fund for Abril Izazaga and Jose Izazaga."}
