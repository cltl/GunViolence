Joe Gomez said. The Police Department is investigating the incident because it occurred at East Church and South Gearhart avenues in the city of Fresno.\nFresno County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Tony Botti said a detective from his office also is working to find out how the accident occurred. Botti said the wound was \u201cthrough and through,\u201d meaning the bullet did not remain in the deputy\u2019s leg. He was expected to leave Community Regional Medical Center by Friday evening.\nThe wounded deputy, who Gomez did not identify, was part of a MAGEC anti-gang team that was staging in the area about 1 p.m. before an enforcement operation was to start nearby.\nGomez said the deputy had just stepped out of an SUV and was putting his firearm in a thigh holster when it discharged. He got back in the vehicle and waited for help.\nPolice, deputies and CHP officers sped to the industrial area where the incident occurred. The deputy is an eight-year veteran and has been with MAGEC for two years.\nFriday\u2019s incident follows the accidental shooting death Monday of sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Rod Lucas. A bullet fired accidentally from a colleague\u2019s gun struck Lucas in the chest. At a news conference Tuesday, Sheriff Margaret Mims said Lucas and a detective, who has not been identified, were discussing the safety of backup weapons when the detective\u2019s gun discharged.\nGomez said it seemed \u201cvery unusual\u201d to have two accidental shootings in one week. Botti called the shootings \u201ctwo separate incidents, unlike one another.\u201d\nUnlike Monday\u2019s shooting, Gomez said it appeared the deputy was armed with his service weapon, which would be a Smith & Wesson M&P .40 caliber handgun. The weapon remained on the floorboard of the deputy\u2019s pickup after the shooting.\nAsked about the weapon, Gomez said the M&P, like the better-known Glock handgun, has \u201cno external safety \u2026 it\u2019s very easy for these guns to go off. You\u2019ve got to be careful.\u201d\nLike the Glock, the M&P uses a \u201cstriker trigger.\u201d According to the website thearmsguide.com, the trigger itself is a safety. Such weapons have been criticized on occasion. A Los Angeles Times report in 2015 disclosed that accidental discharges by Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department deputies more than doubled \u2013 from 12 to 30 \u2013 after the department adopted the M&P.\nHowever, Botti disputed the validity of the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s study as it applied to the Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Office, because L.A. County deputies transitioned from a Beretta sidearm \u2013 which he said had a \u201cvery heavy\u201d trigger pull \u2013 to the M&P. Fresno deputies were previously issued the Smith & Wesson 4506, which has an external safety.\nThe latest incident compounds a difficult time for the Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Office, already coping with the shooting of two correctional officers in the Fresno County Jail lobby in September. They both continue to recover from their wounds.\nJim Guy: 559-441-6339, @jimguy27"}
