However, as they were driving, they were talking about how to clean the gun and Spencer, who was in the front passenger seat, was demonstrating the task for Megan when the gun discharged. The bullet struck Megan in the hip region, according to authorities.\nThey were traveling close to highway speeds, and Spencer told authorities that he had to climb over the arm rest to bring the car to a stop. Spencer called 9-1-1 and got Megan out of the car.\nA doctor who had been driving by stopped and rendered medical assistance. Megan was transported to Loring Hospital in Sac City and airlifted to Mercy Medical in Des Moines where she died a short time later.\nAuthorities haven't closed the case, but at this point, no charges have been filed."}
