You guys suffered enough.\u2019\u201d\nCarter, a slight 20-year-old NYU student from Philadelphia, had just arrived in Orlando, Fla., for her first night of vacation.\nOn Tuesday she and others who sought refuge in the side-by-side men\u2019s and women\u2019s restrooms during Sunday\u2019s attack recounted how the gunman barked orders, claimed to have accomplices and laughed during the attack, which took 49 lives.\nThey also described how those trapped in the restrooms played dead, reached out to police by phone and tried to arrange their escape.\nCarter and Angel Santiago, a 32-year-old sales consultant, met with reporters at Florida Hospital in Orlando to recount the events that unfolded at the gay nightclub just after 2 a.m. Sunday.\nSantiago, lying atop a gurney, a white sheet draped over his lap concealing his wounds, said he and a friend crammed into a stall with 15 to 20 people as the gunfire rang out.\n\u201cAt one point, everyone was just like, \u2018Shh, shh. Be quiet, be quiet.\u2019 That\u2019s when bullets started going through the stall wall toward us,\u201d he said.\nSantiago was shot in his left foot and right knee, his friend in the chest. Then the shooting stopped and the gunman moved on.\nSantiago did not hear the gunman say anything, but Carter did. Omar Mateen, who was born in New York to Afghan immigrant parents, spoke in a foreign language, she said. Then he called 911.\n\u201cThrough the conversation with 911, he said that the reason why he was doing this was he wanted America to stop bombing his country,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the motive was very clear to us who were laying in our blood and other people\u2019s blood who were injured, who were shot \u2014 that we knew what his motive was. And he was not going to stop killing people until he was killed, until he felt that the message got out there.\u201d\nCarter and a friend had gone to the bathroom in search of another friend when the shooting began and the trio fled into a stall. A man who had closed the stall door to shield the others was shot. Later, she heard the gunman complain, \u201cDamn! It jammed,\u201d as he fiddled with the gun.\nAs the hours went by, Carter said, the gunman yelled at people to shut off their cellphones. Some phones rang but went unanswered. \u201cWe were assuming because they were dead,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEvery time a phone would go off or a text message [alert], he would say, \u2018Where is it? Give it up,\u2019\u201d and hostages would have to hand over their phones, she said.\nOrlando Torres, 52, one of the promoters at Pulse, was trapped in a neighboring stall of the same bathroom with a friend. Torres said he drew upon his experience as a former auxiliary police officer in Queens, N.Y., and security guard at Orlando Regional Medical Center, where he and other victims would later be treated.\n\u201cThree hours in that bathroom with that gunman, I\u2019m surprised that we don\u2019t have a bullet wound on us. We were protected, we were saved \u2014 it was just a miracle,\u201d he said in an interview.\nTorres said the gunman called police to say, \u201cAmerica needs to stop bombing ISIS in Syria. He just wanted to repeat, only to get the message across. They were trying to ask him other questions and he wasn\u2019t liking it. He wasn\u2019t ready to give answers and so he hung up on them.\u201d\nLater, he heard the gunman brag, \u201cYeah, I have a lot of bullets.\u201d\nWhen Mateen started shooting into the neighboring stall, one of the wounded reached over and knocked Torres and his friend to the floor. They played dead. He felt something tap his pants pocket \u2014 it felt like the tip of gun.\n\u201cI figured if I didn\u2019t react, I\u2019d look dead,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI thought he would shoot me after that. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d\nInstead, Mateen washed his hands and used the wall hand drier as they heard police arriving.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, when are they going to come in here? It took forever. I\u2019m like, did they forget about us?\u201d Torres said.\nRichard Aiken, 29, was also in the bathroom, and heard the gunman mention the mass shooting that killed nine African Americans at a church in Charleston last June.\n\u201cHe was just saying that he doesn\u2019t have a problem with black people. He said, \u2018You remember the thing that happened in South Carolina at the AME church?\u2019\u201d said Aiken, who is African American and originally from South Carolina.\nAiken was able to call his mother, then texted a friend at 3:14 a.m. who had escaped and was still outside near police. \u201cWhat are they doing to get this person?\u201d Aiken texted. \u201cCan you ask? Maybe we could help.\u201d\nAiken relayed what he and Carter had heard: that the gunman claimed he had an explosive vest, that snipers were positioned around the club, that he had a female accomplice playing dead among the wounded, armed with explosives.\n\u201cHow many gunmen are they? What they look like? Who is he?\u201d his friend texted back.\n\u201cOne person in bathroom with us, sound like he has more than one weapon. We don\u2019t know how he looks,\u201d Aiken replied.\nAround 5 a.m. they heard a boom, and another boom. Aiken heard police on a loudspeaker: \u201cMove as far away from the walls as you can.\u201d\nAbout a minute later, he said, the gunman opened the stall door and looked in.\n\u201cWe made eye contact very briefly and I just put my head back down,\u201d Aiken said, describing Mateen as having \u201ca straight face.\u201d\nThe gunman walked away, then quickly returned and fired into the stall, shooting men and women on both sides of Aiken.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the police exploded the wall, and the police and him exchanged gunfire,\u201d Aiken said.\nAiken lost his best friend, Tevin Crosby, 25. He doesn\u2019t understand why police waited to confront the gunman, why the off-duty officer who police said traded gunfire with him didn\u2019t pursue Mateen when he retreated to the bathrooms.\nNorman Casiano, 25, another clubgoer trapped in a restroom, said hostages begged the gunman not to shoot, insisting they did not know who he was and had not seen his face.\n\u201cAll I heard was a laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a happy villain.\u201d\nCarter, meanwhile, could only wait. At one point, she prayed to die.\n\u201cI was just begging God to take the soul out of my body,\u201d she said.\nAs the police broke through the wall, the gunman backed toward the stall, then scooted away.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Hey you!\u2019 and shot another person, then another person who I\u2019m told shielded me with their body,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who that was, but thank you.\u201d\nShe asked her friend Tiara Parker, 20, if she was shot. She was. So was friend Akyra Murray, who was sprawled on Parker\u2019s lap, unresponsive.\nAs police entered, the hostages warned them about possible snipers, Carter said. A member of the SWAT team dragged her through the grass to an ambulance. A bullet had shattered a bone in her right leg and then entered her left leg. She didn\u2019t realize her left leg was hit until paramedics cut her clothes off in the ambulance.\nWhen the shooting started, she and Murray had been standing in front of an exit and quickly stepped out. She persuaded Murray to go back in to find Parker, and they ended up in the bathroom. Murray, just 18, would die in the attack.\nCarter has spoken with Murray\u2019s mother, who told her, \u201cThat\u2019s OK. God has a plan.\u201d\nBut Carter still feels survivor\u2019s guilt. Of the more than 50 wounded, 33 remained hospitalized Tuesday, half a dozen in critical condition.\nAt the hospital Carter wrote a poem in a small notebook. \u201cThe guilt of feeling grateful to be alive is heavy,\u201d she wrote, recalling \u201cthe other 49 who were not so lucky to feel this pain of mine.\u201d\nShe read it and told the story of those hours in the bathroom without breaking down once. Then suddenly she sobbed uncontrollably as she was wheeled away.\nMORE ON ORLANDO SHOOTING\nHow the Orlando attack could mark a shift for gay Muslims\nA night of terror: How the Orlando nightclub shooting unfolded\nGunman had used gay dating app and visited LGBT nightclub on other occasions, witnesses say\nUPDATES:\n9:14 p.m.: Updated with new details and changes throughout.\nThis article was originally published at 2:37 p.m."}
