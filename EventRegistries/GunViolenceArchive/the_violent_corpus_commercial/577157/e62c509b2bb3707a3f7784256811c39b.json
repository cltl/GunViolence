That he\u2019s still breathing, he says, is nothing short of a miracle.\nAs a group of friends celebrated a graduation early Sunday at one of Orlando\u2019s most popular gay nightclubs, joy turned into terror when a man massacred 49 people.\nJohnson was among the 53 others wounded in the country\u2019s deadliest mass shooting.\n\u201cThe shots came out consecutively, like, right behind each other, so we thought it was the music,\u201d he said. \u201cBut come to find out, it was someone that was shooting in the club.\u201d\nJohnson immediately ran to the restroom to search for his friends.\n\u201cI was unable to locate them when I went to the bathroom,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did locate someone that was trying to use me as their human shield. They all packed themselves into the bathroom stall and tried to close the stall and people were trying to get into there.\u201d\nJohnson knew he had to get out of there.\n\u201cThe people outside of the stall were trying to gather people as a human shield,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I decided that I couldn\u2019t stay in there, because if he were to come into the bathroom, I knew I\u2019d be shot.\u201d\nAs Johnson peeked out of the bathroom, he spotted someone lying on the ground. He made a split decision to make a run for it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I knew it was really serious,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard the gunshots coming from afar, so I took my chance to run out of the club. I ran out to the nearest exit that I could see.\u201d\nAs soon as he made it out of the club, Johnson felt two bullets pierce his body -- one through his right hip, another in his left arm.\n\u201cIt went through my right-hand side and my hip. I had an entry and an exit wound, so it went right through,\u201d he said. \u201cMy left-hand side, when I got shot, it actually shattered my bone and that was protruding from my arm.\u201d\nAt the risk of his own life, a complete stranger came to Johnson\u2019s aid. The man removed a bandana and used it to stop Johnson\u2019s bleeding. He also brought Johnson water to drink as he awaited an ambulance.\n\u201cIf I were to see him again, I\u2019d tell him thank you,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe tried his best to keep my mind occupied on something else and to not pay attention to the wound, to have faith in dialogue. So I was very thankful for that.\u201d\nSurgeons at Orlando Regional Medical Center spent four hours drilling screws into Johnson\u2019s bone to put it back in place. He has two more surgeries ahead of him.\n\u201cI was thinking I was going to get out,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI have faith in God, and I know he was going to direct my path through this situation. I\u2019m just blessed. It\u2019s nothing short of a miracle.\u201d"}
