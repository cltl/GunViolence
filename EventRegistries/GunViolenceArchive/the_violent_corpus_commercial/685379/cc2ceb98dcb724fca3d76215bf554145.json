Right now they are being charged with aggravated robbery; they are persons of interest in the homicide which occurred on Ryburn Avenue last evening,\u201d Dayton police Lt. Mark Ponichtera said. \u201cCharges will be presented to the Montgomery County prosecutor for full review in connection to this homicide.\u201d\nThe robbery charges stem from an incident that happened before the shooting, the lieutenant said, but it\u2019s not clear whether it is connected to the shooting that killed Brandon Lanier and sent three others to local hospitals for treatment.

Mark Ponichtera said when officers arrived on scene, one person, only identified as a black man in his middle to late 20s, was found shot and was pronounced dead at the scene.\nPonichtera said while police were investigating the scene, three additional shooting victims were dropped off by a private vehicle at Good Samaritan Hospital.\nOne of the additional victim has life-threatening injuries, while the other two have non-life threatening injuries.\nInvestigators said upwards of 50 rounds were shot, but police did not release how many different type of calibers were found. Ponichtera added the incident is not being called a gunfight yet and police are unsure on what led up to the incident.\nTwo people were being interviewed at the scene by investigators, but police were also unsure of their roles, if any, in the shooting. Police were also in the process of asking neighbors if they witnessed the incident.\nPonichtera said a four-door Chevrolet Impala is believed to have fled during the shooting and is still unaccounted for. The car is described as having bullet holes and is either black with silver doors, or a silver with black doors, as investigators have received conflicting reports on the car\u2019s colors.\nAnyone with information on the incident is urged to contact Dayton police."}
