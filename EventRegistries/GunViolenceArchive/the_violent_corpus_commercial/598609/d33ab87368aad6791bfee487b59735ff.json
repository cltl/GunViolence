And so God, bless her. Touch her life,\" Herron said. \"Be with her father. Bring healing father!\"\nPastor Danny Givens, a cousin of the children's mother, said the 2-year-old boy, King, was a fun-loving bubbly kid and his baby sister is a sweet young soul.\n\"My family's in a state of shock, an extreme state of shock,\" Givens said. \"I come from a really big family. Really big family. My first cousins \u2014 there's 50 of us now.\"\nPolice say Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau and Mayor Betsy Hodges visited the family at the hospital but were not available to comment."}
