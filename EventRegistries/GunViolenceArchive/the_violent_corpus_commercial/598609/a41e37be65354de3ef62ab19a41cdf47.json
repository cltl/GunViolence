Peterson, 25, of Brooklyn Center, was jailed around sunrise Friday on a pair of felonies stemming from the killing, which stunned the city and sparked a renewed effort to end the street violence that has plagued much of the North Side the past few months.\nThe charges say Peterson exchanged gunfire with the driver of a black Chevrolet Impala who fired the two initial shots on July 8, striking Le\u2019Vonte in the chest and grazing his 15-month-old sister in the leg. Police are still searching for the Impala\u2019s driver.\nOn Friday, a steady stream of grieving relatives and prominent community members filed into Bethel Christian Fellowship Church in St. Paul, removing their hats as they paused in front of a white casket hardly bigger than a mailbox. Some carefully laid teddy bears next to the boy\u2019s body.\nSeveral speakers remembered him as bright and bubbly, protective of his younger sisters.\n\u201cHe enjoyed going to the park, swimming and playing with his cars,\u201d read a program handed out at the entrance to the church. \u201cHe also loved Paw Patrol and Monsters Inc., but most of all he loved his pacifier.\u201d\nPastor Danny Givens said that Le\u2019Vonte\u2019s death should serve as a wake-up call. Givens, who has played a prominent role in the local Black Lives Matter movement, said he had heard the news as he was preparing for an interview with a local TV station to discuss the fatal police shooting of 32-year-old Philando Castile two days before.\nAs he spoke, several family members in the front row dabbed their eyes with tissues, while a slideshow of photos of trips to the grocery store and an indoor swimming park was projected onto a screen.\nGivens, whose cousin is the boy\u2019s mother, LeShae Jones, said he hoped that sight of the small casket would persuade potential witnesses to come forward and provide police with information about the slaying. He also called for more community support of young parents who are juggling child care and jobs, \u201cinstead of vilifying them.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have somebody going out the back door with bricks, when we\u2019re coming through the front door with the mortar,\u201d he told the crowd.\nA collection plate was passed around that Givens said would help cover the cost of the funeral and new clothes for Le\u2019Vonte\u2019s surviving siblings.\nOne of the shots from the Impala struck Le\u2019Vonte in the chest, mortally wounding him, authorities said. Authorities charged Peterson with returning fire at the driver of the Impala, who pulled up beside his van at the intersection of Penn and Lowry avenues and started shooting, according to a criminal complaint filed Friday in Hennepin County District Court. Several of the rounds fired by Peterson struck a nearby hardware store. After the brief exchange of gunfire, the van turned onto Penn, while the Impala fled down Lowry. Prosecutors said that Peterson, who had previously been convicted of drug possession, is prohibited from carrying a firearm.\nNo motive has emerged, though investigators are looking closely at whether the shooting was in retaliation for an earlier incident.\nRelatives insisted that Peterson was just trying to defend himself and his children when he returned fire.\nPeterson rushed the children to North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale at 11:30 a.m., where Le\u2019Vonte died.\n\u201cThe last thing that [Le\u2019Vonte] saw was his father carrying him to safety,\u201d Givens said.\nPolice at the hospital found two bullet holes in the van. On the driver\u2019s side floor was a discharged cartridge casing from a .45-caliber gun. Records from Peterson\u2019s social media account show he was involved in trading a gun for a .45-caliber the day before the shooting, charges said.\nAuthorities have said the investigation remains a top priority. They have assigned nearly a dozen detectives to the case.\nPeterson is charged with possessing a firearm after a conviction for a violent crime and drive-by shooting, both felonies. He remains jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail. A court date has not been set.\nAs Le\u2019Vonte\u2019s funeral procession entered the cemetery via horse-drawn carriage \u2014 just as Philando Castile had been carried from his funeral the day before \u2014 Givens posted a live video of himself on Facebook riding next to the casket.\n\u201cSee this? That\u2019s what violence does,\u201d he said. \u201cViolence puts us like this, y\u2019all.\u201d"}
