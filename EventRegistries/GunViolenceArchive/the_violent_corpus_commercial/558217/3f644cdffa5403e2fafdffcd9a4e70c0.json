He was put into custody at the Franklin County jail and was awaiting extradition.\nColumbus police arrested Dixon at 12:38 a.m. at a duplex after receiving an email from APD saying \u201cthat they had reason to believe Dixon was possibly in Columbus,\u201d said Columbus police spokeswoman Denise Alex-Bouzounis.\nSWAT officers found Dixon with a 21-year-old woman, whom he was keeping hostage, Alex-Bouzounis added. Police released no information on whether that woman suffered injuries.\nThe woman\u2019s identity and connection to Dixon was also unknown, Alex-Bouzounis said.\nAdditionally, police would not say why Dixon fled to Ohio as it is part of the ongoing investigation, Hallingse said. Tips from the public aided in his arrest, she said.\nA jogger discovered Pickens and her son in Jones Park, near Ira B. Jones Elementary School, shortly after 6 a.m. Thursday morning. Pickens had been shot in the face and was declared dead at the scene. Her son was also shot and taken to Mission Hospital with life-threatening injuries.\nHe remained in critical but stable condition Friday.\n\u201cHe\u2019s hanging in there,\u201d said Keith Knox, a family member. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter. He\u2019s doing very well, and he\u2019ll turn around. But it\u2019s going to be a long roller coaster ride to recovery.\u201d\nPickens grew up in Asheville and had Zachaeus with a former boyfriend, according to his sister, Shecara Mitchell. The two were co-parenting the toddler and had a good relationship even though they were no longer dating, Mitchell said.\n\u201cThey both loved that baby and didn\u2019t deserve what happened,\u201d she said.\nWhen police arrived at the park Thursday morning, Pickens was found dead in the grass and her son was lying next to her, according to Dr. Harold Schutte, a state medical examiner. According to the jogger, both victims were unresponsive when she found them.\nPickens sustained a gunshot to the right side of her face in the area of her cheek, he said. The victims had no other injuries.\nIt also appears that Pickens and Zachaeus were shot at Jones Park, Schutte added. An autopsy in Winston-Salem was completed on Friday by a state medical examiner.\nMany family members were in disbelief when they heard the news about Pickens and her son.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst news I could have gotten,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s unexplainable, and I just want everyone to continue to pray for (Pickens\u2019) family, the baby and my brother.\u201d\nAccording to Knox, Dixon and Pickens had been dating and but recently had a dispute.\nFamily, friends and community members gathered at the Hill Street Baptist Church and joined in prayer Friday for families of the victims and the community.\n\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d said Torre White, one of Pickens\u2019 cousins. \u201cI hung up the phone when I heard the news.\u201d\nWhite said she was close to her cousin and described her as \u201cloving, funny, and outgoing.\u201d\nCandace also always had a smile on her face, her aunt Irene Pickens said.\n\u201cShe was the sweetest girl growing up,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had two twin brothers who she acted like a mother to and once Zachaeus came along they had a really strong bond. She was a very good mother to him.\u201d\nMany family members described Zachaeus as a smart, sweet, happy and well-behaved boy who loved his mother.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t get him away from his mother,\u201d said Barbara Ann Pickens, who was Candace's aunt. \u201cHe loved her and she loved him.\u201d\nAnother vigil was planned for community members to pay their respects to Pickens and her son, according to a Facebook page. A GoFundMe page has also been set up to support Zachaeus.\nThe vigil is scheduled for 8 p.m. at Jones Park on Saturday.\nA teacher at Ira B. Jones Elementary school felt compelled to help organize the vigil for Saturday night.\n\"We just want to honor her,\" said Melissa Officianalis.\nAs the investigation continues, family is taking steps to plan a service for Candace Pickens and is continuing to spend time in the hospital while Zachaeus recovers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking it one step at a time to get everything together,\u201d Irene Pickens said.\nFamily members also want justice for Candace Pickens, White said.\n\u201cI just want my cousin to be remembered for who she was,\u201d she said.\nCheck back at CITIZEN-TIMES.com for updates."}
