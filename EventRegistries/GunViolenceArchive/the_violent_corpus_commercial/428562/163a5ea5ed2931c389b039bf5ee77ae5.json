The boy was sitting on the floorboard of a four-wheel ATV, trying to stay warm and out of the wind, when a hunting companion pulled up next to his vehicle.\nAs the man got out of his own four-wheeler and was removing his rifle from its front seat, the weapon discharged, striking the boy.\nBilodeau did not specify where the bullet struck the boy. Deputies and paramedics were unable to revive the child, who was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after a Life Flight medical helicopter."}
