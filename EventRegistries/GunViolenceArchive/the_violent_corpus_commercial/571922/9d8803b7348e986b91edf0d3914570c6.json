The teen, identified as DaMontez Jones, was home alone with his three other brothers at the time of the incident. His mother and her fianc\u00e9 were not at the residence.\nAccording to our partners at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, police believe Jones found the gun on the top shelf in a bedroom closet. The firearm did not have a safety lock.\nJones was rushed to a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the chest and later died.\nInvestigators believe the shooting to be accidental and give credence to the selfie theory because Jones\u2019 older brothers told their father about the idea and because police found a cellphone near the teenager.\nPolice have sent the cellphone to a lab to see if they can find any pictures of Jones with the gun."}
