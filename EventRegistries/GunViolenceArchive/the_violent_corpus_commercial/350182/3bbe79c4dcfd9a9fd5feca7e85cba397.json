One deputy shot back although it was unclear whether Pitts was shot by the return fire or committed suicide, Levett said.\nMun Hyuk Cha, a 44-year-old clerk, and Otonicar Jimquez Aikens, a 39-year-old customer, were shot and killed at Magnet Package Store, Levett said.\nThe killings followed an earlier confrontation when Pitts forced a store clerk to return his driver\u2019s license at gunpoint. The clerk had retained the license during a dispute, Levett said.\nDeputies were out looking for Pitts by the time he had returned to the store and opened fire with a pistol, Levett said.\nPitts fled after another patron, Todd C. Scott, of Covington, opened fire with his own hand gun. It is still unclear whether Aikens died before or after Scott returned fire with Pitts, but the sheriff credited Scott with saving lives.\n\u201cI consider him to be a hero,\u201d Levett said.\nPitts police record included a driving while intoxicated charge and a misdemeanor marijuana possession in 2010 in Newton County, Levett said.\nThe details were still sketchy Monday because police had not interviewed Pitts\u2019 parents Alan Pitts, 63, and Judith Pitts, 64, who were still in an Atlanta hospital, Levett said.\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which in investigating the officer-involved shooting, expects that the dash-camera recording of the shootout at Ebeneezer Road will be released Tuesday, said Sherry Lang, deputy director of the GBI."}
