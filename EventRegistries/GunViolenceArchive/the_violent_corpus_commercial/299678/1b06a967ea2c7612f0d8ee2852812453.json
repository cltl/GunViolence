Their mother and two younger sisters, ages 2 and 3, were home at the time, but there were no other injuries.\nThere was a toy gun on the family's front lawn.\nThe uncle said the real guns are usually kept in a safe place.\n\"We have a safe in here,\" Gray said. \"So I have no idea if it was in the safe or we were walking around with it and set it down somewhere. I have no idea.\"\nSo far, no charges have been filed in the case but that could change.\n\"They can be charged with making a weapon accessible to a child which is a class a misdemeanor,\" Gilliland said.\nThis is the third incident involving children and guns since Friday in the Houston area.\nGilliland urged gun owners to be careful.\n\"Firearms being accessible to children and other adults, make sure they are secured. Make sure they are locked up,\" Gilliland said.\nHCSO is also offering free gun locks this week.\n(Photo: Rucks Russell / KHOU 11 News)\nAlso read:"}
