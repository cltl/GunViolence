The intersection was closed and police tape was put up around an apartment building.\nJust before 5 p.m., what appeared to be a tactical team approached an apartment's door, said they were executing a search warrant, and demanded the occupants come to the door. Authorities entered the apartment about 15 minutes later.\nIt was not immediately clear whether anyone was in the apartment or whether anyone had been arrested. Police say the shooting suspect and victim knew each other, and that the shooting was not random. Police did not say whether the shooting happened in the area of the apartment, or somewhere else.\nPolice also believe there is no concern to public safety.\nWe'll update this story as additional information is released."}
