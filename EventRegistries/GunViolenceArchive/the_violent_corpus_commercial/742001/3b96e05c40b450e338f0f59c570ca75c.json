Four people were injured, but a total of 16 people were involved in the incident. The call for help came in late Tuesday, just before midnight, from a home located in the 500 block of Hawthorne Drive.\nThe situation began with a post on Facebook about an incident that took place a few days ago in Dallas, but details about that post and that incident have not been discussed by officials.\nAfter the online post, a group of nine people from Dallas drove to the Allen home to confront seven people there. The situation escalated when the people inside of the home walked out with various weapons, including knives and what is believed to be an airsoft rifle.\nThat display of weapons triggered gunfire from the Dallas group. Four people from the Allen home were injured, with three of the victims going to a local hospital in Allen and the other victim being taken to a hospital in Plano for treatment. According to authorities, all four of the victims are expected to survive.\nA neighbor recalled hearing between eight and 10 shots. \u201cFirst, I thought the neighbors were arguing, or maybe they got into it because, I don\u2019t know, they always had seemed to have issues over there,\u201d stated James Ramsey. \u201cAnything can happen when shots are fired. You can ricochet or go somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cIt was like something you would see on \u2018The First 48.\u2019 It was so scary,\u201d said witness Lisa Coleman, who recorded the shouting before bullets sent her looking for cover. \u201cI heard this one guy saying, \u2018You want some of this? You want some of this? I can get you too.\u2019 And that\u2019s when you heard about eight rounds of gunshots.\u201d\nThe nine people from Dallas have all been detained by police, and one of them has since been arrested. He has been identified as Devonte Wade. The 20-year-old man is charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. More arrests are expected to be made.\nOfficials have not released the names of anyone else involved in this incident, only saying that they were both men and women who are all most likely under 30 years old \u2014 some of them teenagers.\nColeman actually knows one of the teenagers, a senior in high school. \u201cWhen they were putting her in the ambulance, I kind of waved at her and said it\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI was crying. She was crying, screaming from pain.\u201d\nNeighbors said that this rental home is a magnet for trouble. Coleman estimated that more than a dozen calls have been made to police about something happening at this property within the last five years.\n\u201cThe good news is \u2014 if there\u2019s any good news \u2014 is that the people responsible for it are being detained or in custody,\u201d said Sgt. John Felty with the Allen Police Department."}
