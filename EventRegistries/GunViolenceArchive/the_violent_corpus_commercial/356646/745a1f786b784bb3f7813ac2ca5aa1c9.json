Osorio, Chicago Tribune)\nA 15-year-old Schurz High School student who apparently shot himself by accident has died, according to authorities.\nBobby McCullough, of the 4100 block of West Cornelia Avenue, was pronounced dead at 6:27 p.m. Friday at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office and police.\nMcCullough suffered a gunshot wound to the left side of his head about 7:45 a.m. Friday in the stairwell of an apartment building in the 4700 block of West Addison Street, police said.\nWhen police got there, the teen, who lives about a mile away, was already in an ambulance, so officers spoke to two witnesses, an 18-year-old man and a 17-year-old Schurz classmate who lives at the Addison address, according to a police report.\nThe classmate said he'd gotten a phone call from McCullough who told him he was going to come over. A short time later, the 15-year-old knocked on his friend's back door and all three began talking in the back stairwell, the report said.\nThe classmate told police that he heard a \"loud pop\"\u2019 after peering down at his phone, the report said. \"He looked up and the victim was lying on the ground bleeding from his head with a gun in his right hand,\" the report said.\nA 45-year-old female relative who lives with the classmate came out of the apartment and tried to stop the bleeding with a blanket, the report said.\nThe 18-year-old, who is listed in the police report as a gang member, told police he did not see the weapon fired, but also heard the shot and saw the boy on the ground.\nThe two teens and the 45-year-old woman were all interviewed by police, who listed the incident as an accidental injury.\nA couple of hours after it happened, a black bicycle and backpack rested outside the apartment's back door, which was stained with blood. Nearby were a pair of black headphones and a pack of cough drops.\nKaren Schabes woke Friday morning to screams and peered out her window to see two teens frantically running from a three-flat in Old Irving Park on the Northwest Side.\n\"It was horrific,\" she said. \"It sounded painful.\"\nSchabes said the teens were screaming, \"Oh my God,\" as they ran from the building.\nWayne Sibenhaller, a neighbor who lives right off North Kilpatrick Avenue, said he was walking his dog early in the morning when he saw a boy run out of the back alley where the shooting occurred to flag down a gas truck.\n\"The gas guy put his head out the window to say something,\" Sibenhaller said. \"It seemed like the kid ran after the gas truck to get some sort of information.\"\nChicago Tribune's Jasper Craven contributed."}
