The woman and baby had been shot. Details of their injuries and conditions were not released, but Senties said they had non-life-threatening wounds.\nWhen officers arrived at the scene of the shooting, they found two men with gunshot wounds. They were taken to Ben Taub General Hospital. No information was released about their wounds or conditions, but Senties said the men had non-life-threatening injuries.\nWhile officers were at the shooting scene, a third man told investigators he also had been wounded in the gunfire. He was taken to Memorial Hermann hospital.
