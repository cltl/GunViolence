One person facing away from the club pulled a pistol and started firing, officials said. A person from the other group, who was facing the club, pulled out his own pistol and fired back, bullets crossing the street to shatter the windows of a shopping center and to strike parked cars.\n\"We don't know if they were bystanders or participating in the fight,\" said Thomas Gilliland, a spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff's Office.\nSome people fled the shooting, running back across the street toward the club. The shooters left the scene in unidentified vehicles.\nTwo men ages 20 and 27 were transported to Memorial Hermann Hospital in critical but stable condition, two men ages 19 and 23 were treated at Ben Taub and three men drove themselves to Northwest Hospital, Gilliland said. An eighth man was treated for other wounds, but had not been shot. All are expected to survive.\nGilliland said details of the shooting, such as its cause and a description of the get-away vehicles, remain under investigation.\n\"We had 60 witnesses we had to get statements from,\" he said. \"Hopefully we find someone who saw something happen and hopefully we'll find out who these guys are.\""}
