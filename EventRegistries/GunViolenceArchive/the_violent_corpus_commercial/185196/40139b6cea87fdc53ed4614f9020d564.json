The other victims happened to get hit by random gunfire,\" says Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance.\nBoth men inside the Honda were killed, and three others were injured when about 50 rounds were fired from two assault rifles and one handgun. The weapons have not yet been recovered.\nAuthorities have now released the identities of the men killed in the shooting: 26-year-old Demarcus McElroy and 38-year-old Steve McElroy.\nChief Vance says, often the guns that fall into the hands of the wrong people are legal. As long is a person is 18 years old, not a convicted felon, and the gun itself is legal, not much can be done. He understands Jackson's serious crime problem, and hopes to get to the root of it.\n\"It's our hope that we can continue to build relationships in these neighborhoods, develop informants who may have knowledge of these beefs that are going on before they play out in such a tragic way so that perhaps we can intervene,\" he says. \"We want to move forward, not stay the same. We're just asking for anybody, everybody's help that agrees with that.\"\nNo arrests have been made in the case.\nCopyright 2014 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved."}
