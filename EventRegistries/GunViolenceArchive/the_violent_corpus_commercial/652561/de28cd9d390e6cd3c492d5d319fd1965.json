There will be one more deputy there this weekend.\nSaginaw County Sheriff Bill Federspiel, Michigan State Police Lieutenant Dave Simon and John Leuenberger, who owns the complex, made that announcement at the apartments Thursday morning.\n\u201cWhat we are looking at here is something we have not dealt with before,\u201d Federspiel said.\nThere was a large party Saturday night that continued Sunday morning at the complex, which is across the street from Saginaw Valley State University property.\nPolice believe a man pulled out a gun and shot five people, all who are recovering with minor injuries.\nNot only will there be one more deputy, Michigan State Police will devote some resources in the vicinity of the complex to keep a closer eye on large parties.\nLeuenberger says the complex had five security officers on site as well and will try to keep the size of the parties under control. He doesn't believe there was 1,000 people at the party, but he agrees the crowd was too large.\n\u201cWe are working with university and the police departments to correct what was wrong and it will be down,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in all of our best interests to do whatever we can to develop effective strategies to make sure this doesn't happen again,\u201d Simon said.\nSVSU President Don Bachand has met with police and the complex owners.\n\u201cWe have improved our methods of communicating with one another. We had difficulty communicating with the management folks shortly after the event,\u201d he said.\nBachand says the school has no jurisdiction over the complex, but the two entities are working on a memorandum - a working agreement to prevent similar problems.\nBachand wants an agreement sooner, rather than later.\n\u201cThere is some urgency to what we are doing here,\u201d he said.\nFederspiel says the search continues for the gunman."}
