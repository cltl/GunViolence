Harry Kastrinakis said preliminary information indicates the groups were involved in a shootout as people were leaving the nightclub around closing time. An estimated 20 rounds were fired.\nPolice responded to the scene at 1:58 a.m. Some officers who were within earshot of the gunfire responded within moments. Multiple ambulances were dispatched to the scene.\nOne shooting victim showed up at Mercy Medical Center for treatment, while four victims were brought to Baystate's trauma unit. None of their injuries were believed to be life-threatening. Some were shot in the torso, but most were hit in the arms or legs, Kastrinakis said.\nOne victim was shot in the leg in Baystate's parking lot, but Kastrinakis said police were unsure if that incident was related to the shooting outside the nightclub.\nSeveral police police units were stationed near the emergency room entrance as a precaution to prevent any retribution attacks, but gunfire erupted in the parking lot despite the police presence.\nPolice do not know how many shooters were involved in the downtown gunfight outside Lux. The incident remains under investigation.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Springfield Police Detective Bureau at (413) 787-6355.\nThis is a breaking story; more information will be posted as it becomes available."}
