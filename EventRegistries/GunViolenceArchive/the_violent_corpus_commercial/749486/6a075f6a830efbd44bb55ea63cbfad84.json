Ben Beall, a homicide investigator with the Harris County Sheriff's Office. When they arrived, they found two groups involved in a fight. They also found a 17-year-old man lying in the road. He had been hit by a car and possibly shot. The teen, whose name has not been released, died.\nBeall said a man later called 911 in Spring, saying he had run over someone as he sped away from the fracas. Afterward, deputies determined at least one person had fired gunshots after the vehicle hit the victim. Five to six bullet casings were found on the ground.\nDetectives are trying to unravel the events that led up to the disturbance, shooting and apparent hit-and-run collision. The person or people who fired gunshots have not been found. The driver of the car is being interviewed.\n\"This a pretty complicated investigation,\" Beall said.\nWhen the disturbance began, a Harris County Precinct 4 deputy constable received minor injuries she pulled up to the scene where 70 people were gathered. She was assaulted when the crowd became unruly, Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said.\nThe deputy was checked out at the Texas Medical Center as a precaution, Herman added. She was not identified, but has been with the department a couple of years, he said."}
