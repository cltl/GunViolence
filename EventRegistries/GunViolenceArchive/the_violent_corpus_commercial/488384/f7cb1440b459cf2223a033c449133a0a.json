Barnett is charged with first-degree felony child endangerment.\nAccording to court records, Barnett\u2019s daughter brought the girl to her house for a visit. Barnett told police she was cleaning the gun but slid it under the couch when the victim and another child came into the room.\nBarnett said she left the room, heard a pop and returned to find the girl with a gunshot wound to her leg.\n\u201cWe are fortunate today that another child was not killed due to the irresponsibility of an adult. As gun owners, we have the simple responsibility to ensure that these deadly weapons are safely stored. This isn\u2019t hard, but it is absolutely life and death,\u201d Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said.\nProsecutors asked for Barnett\u2019s bail to be set at $30,000 and asked that she not be allowed to have unsupervised contact with children."}
