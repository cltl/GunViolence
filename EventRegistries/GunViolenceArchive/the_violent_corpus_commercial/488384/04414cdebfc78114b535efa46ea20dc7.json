Barnett has been charged with one felony count of endangering the welfare of a child.\nAccording to court records, Barnett\u2019s daughter brought the victim to visit her grandmother. Barnett told police she was cleaning her gun and slid the gun under the couch when the victim and another child came into the room.\nBarnett said she thought that would prevent the victim from getting the gun. She then left the room and heard a \"pop.\" Upon returning, Barnett found the victim shot in the leg.\n\"We are fortunate that another child was not killed due to the irresponsibility of an adult. As gun-owners, we have the simple responsibility to ensure that these deadly-weapons are safely stored.\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said. \"This isn\u2019t hard, but it is absolutely life and death.\"\nProsecutors have requested a bond of $30,000 and have asked for a special condition of any bond to include that the victim shall have no unsupervised contact with children under the age of 17.\nCopyright 2016 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
