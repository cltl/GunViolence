The guys were best friends. There were no hostile intentions.\u201d\nOfficers were dispatched to the apartment around 1:36 a.m. They found two rounds of ammunition in the gun\u2019s chamber, Babcock said. The mother of Brown\u2019s friend told police she didn\u2019t know there was a gun in the apartment and that she didn\u2019t own one.\nA few hours later, officers were dispatched to a Benbrook water tower in the 3900 block of Sagebrush Road.\nJacob Spradlin, 17, had called 911 around 5:27 a.m., telling Benbrook police that he was suicidal and that he had climbed to the top of the tower. Spradlin had a brief conversation with police before jumping.\n\u201cHe basically just let us know where he would be,\u201d Babcock said.\nOfficers found Spradlin dead beneath the tower. Babcock said Spradlin had to climb a barbed-wire fence at the base of the tower before climbing to the top.\nFamily members of Brown and Spradlin could not be reached. Spradlin lived in Benbrook, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner\u2019s website. A home address for Brown wasn\u2019t listed.\nFort Worth school district spokesman Clint Bond confirmed that both boys were students in the district but wouldn\u2019t disclose which school either attended.\n\u201cI can tell you that counselors have already been arranged for those campuses that are involved,\u201d Bond said.\nRyan Osborne, 817-390-7760\nTwitter: @RyanOsborneFWST"}
