The guys were best friends. There were no hostile intentions.\"\nOfficers were dispatched to the apartment around 1:36 a.m. They found two rounds of ammunition in the gun's chamber, Babcock said. The mother of Brown's friend told police she didn't know there was a gun in the apartment and that she didn't own one.\nA few hours later, officers were dispatched to a Benbrook water tower in the 3900 block of Sagebrush Road.\nJacob Spradlin, 17, had called 911 around 5:27 a.m., telling Benbrook police that he was suicidal and that he had climbed to the top of the tower. Spradlin had a brief conversation with police before jumping."}
