Officials said one of the adult male victims was shot in the head and was taken to a hospital. Authorities said he was pronounced dead at 10:10 p.m.\n\"There were at least two to three locations that the victims ran to and they weren't the same location, so that's why you have blood at different locations,\" Baltimore police Maj. Osbourne Robinson said.\nIt started just before 4 p.m. Wednesday, when officers on patrol in the area heard a gunshot and then saw a person fire another shot.\n\"At that time, they engaged that person and was able to take that person into custody. At least three others ran. They pursued one, they were able to get another one in the alleyway. At least two got away from them,\" Robinson said.\nOne of the people who ran barricaded himself in a house on the 800 block of Linwood Avenue for a few hours with children inside.
