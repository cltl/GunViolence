Salamanca discharged one round, which hit the front seat passenger in the back.\nBailes said the teens tried to take their injured friend to the Quick Care off Shallowford Road in Oakwood, but found the business was closed when they arrived. At that point, according to Bailes, the teens flagged down an Oakwood police officer for help, and Salamanca ran from the scene.\nThe shooting victim was taken to Northeast Georgia Medical Center where she underwent emergency surgery for her injuries. As of Saturday morning, there was no word on her condition.\nBailes said investigators learned Salamanca was wanted by the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) for escape. Deputies tried tracking the suspect with K9 officers, but could not find him. Later in the evening, patrol deputies found Salamanca and arrested him.\nAt last report, Salamanca remained in the Hall County Jail, charged with reckless conduct. Bailes said other charges are possible.\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 AccessWDUN.com\nAll rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed without permission."}
