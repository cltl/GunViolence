Prosecutors say in March 2015, Nazerian bought a gun for his teenage friend, a juvenile, who accidentally shot that gun inside his Alief apartment, sending a bullet into the apartment unit next door. That bullet killed Jairo Victoriano, whose emotional parents addressed Nazerian in court on Thursday.\n\u201cHis parents both shared that they weren\u2019t bitter toward the defendant, they were just really looking for some justice,\u201d said Ashley Guice, Harris County assistant district attorney. \u201cThey wanted to hear something, anything from the defendant here, at least that he was sorry.\u201d\nWhen asked what Nazerian said to them, Guice replied, \u201cThat he was extremely sorry, that he didn\u2019t mean for this to happen and he sends his condolences to the family.\u201d\n(Photo: Family photo)\nFamilies from both parties embraced each other as they left the courtroom. They did not wish to comment to media.\nProsecutors say this sentence is unusual because those facing this particular charge are usually family members, who often don\u2019t see jail time.\n\u201cWe charge them, but when it goes down to be indicted, the grand jury usually takes out of consideration that they\u2019ve already lost a loved one in the case,\u201d said Jeff McShan of the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office. \u201cSo rarely is it charged.\u201d\nProsecutors say they don\u2019t know why the juvenile wanted the gun and that they can\u2019t discuss charges or details of his case because he\u2019s a juvenile.\nNazerian\u2019s charge, a Class A misdemeanor, carried a maximum of 12 months in jail."}
