David Kaiser.\n\"When they arrived they discovered a young black male slumped over a bicycle,\" Kaiser said. \"According to the victim, he was shot by an unknown male who was in a white or silver car.\"\nPolice have not yet confirmed the bicyclist's age or identity, he said, but have said he was shot once in the stomach.\nHe was taken to a local hospital for treatment and is currently in critical condition, Kaiser said.\n\"He was riding his bicycle when he got shot,\" he said. \"Apparently he continued to ride until he couldn't ride anymore.\"\nAn hour after police arrived on scene, a mountain bike still rested against the curb on the east side of Ray.\nSaginaw city police officers and Michigan State Police troopers walked up and down the road, looking for evidence, while yellow police tape blocked the section of road to traffic.\nThe stretch of Ray is bordered on one side by the now-vacant and overgrown former Saginaw County Fairgrounds property and on the other by Saginaw High School's athletic fields.\nNo further information about the shooting is available at this time, Kaiser said."}
