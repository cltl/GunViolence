No other details were available Saturday.\nDOC spokeswoman Stephanie Givens said Williams' death was under investigation.\nIn November, Williams pleaded guilty to three counts of murder and four counts of attempted murder inside an Anderson County courtroom.\nProsecutors at the time said a March 5 argument over shoes led to Williams shooting Victor Vandegrift, 48; then Wanda Anderson, 40; and Hank Eaton, 32, at a residence on Law Street.\nThey said Williams fled the scene in Anderson's truck, leading deputies on a pursuit in which he shot at county deputies and attempted to carjack a woman at her house.\nSolicitor Chrissy Adams at the time said she considered pursuing the death penalty but settled on the consecutive life sentences without parole as part of the plea deal.\nRELATED:\nWilliamston man pleads guilty to three fatal shootings"}
