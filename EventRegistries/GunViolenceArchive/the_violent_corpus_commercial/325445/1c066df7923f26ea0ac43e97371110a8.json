Their conditions also were not available.\nIt appears a group from Williamsport and one from Philadelphia argued inside the club, Assistant Chief Timothy Miller said. The shooting occurred as the club was emptying at closing time with at least some of those wounded being bystanders not involved in the dispute, he said.\nThe shooter was a male who is believed to have left the club, got a handgun from a vehicle, returned and opened fire, Miller said. Police have not ruled out there might have been more than one shooter, he said.\nWitnesses have provided information that is expected to help in identifying the shooter, he said."}
