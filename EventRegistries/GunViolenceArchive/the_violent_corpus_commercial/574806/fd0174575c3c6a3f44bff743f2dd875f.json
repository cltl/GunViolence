The 23-year-old Glide Glide resident is a convicted felon and wanted on a parole violation, Hutson said.\nWeiker walked to a nearby ranger station for help. She told deputies the shooting was accidental, and Allen fled.\nHutson declined to say how the gun went off, citing the ongoing investigation. One shot was fired, he said.\nDeputies searched the town and park area, but they could not find him. Hutson said Allen is potentially armed and should not be confronted. Anyone with information should contact the Douglas County Sheriff's Office at 541-440-4471.\n-- Tony Hernandez\nthernandez@oregonian.com\n503-294-5928\n@tonyhreports"}
