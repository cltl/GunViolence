He then allegedly proceeded to Norman Street where a 39-year-old man received multiple gunshot wounds.\nEufaula Police officers first made contact with Rhymes near Zion Church where he fired shots at the officers. During the vehicle and foot pursuit, Rhymes continued to fire at the officers.\nIn order to stop the imminent deadly threat posed by Mr. Rhymes, the officers employed deadly force.\nRhymes was pronounced dead at Medical Center Barbour. No officers were injured in the incident. Pursuant to the Eufaula Police Department\u2019s established policy, the officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave.\nThe 2-year-old was taken by jet to Birmingham. The other two victims were transported to hospitals in Dothan in critical condition. Investigation of the officer involved shooting has been turned over to the Alabama State Bureau of Investigation.\nThe other shootings remain under investigation by the Eufaula Police Department. Preliminary reports indicate domestic disputes involving multiple parties as a possible motive for the shooting rampage by Mr. Rhymes.\n\u201cOur prayers are with the victims, officers and all those affected by this incident. Our highly trained officers are prepared to address such incidents and I commend the officers who responded and deployed their training both effectively and efficiently this morning,\u201d Chief Steve Watkins said.\nCopyright 2016 WTVM.
