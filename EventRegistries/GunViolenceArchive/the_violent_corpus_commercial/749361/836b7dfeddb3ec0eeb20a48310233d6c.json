CHARLES COUNTY, Mo. (KMOV.com) \u2013 A young mother from St. Peters was killed in a triple homicide in Kansas City on Thursday night.\nAccording to police, three men entered the Trails at the Ridge apartment complex and shot five people inside. Three people were killed, including 20-year-old Ali Brown. Brown\u2019s two year old son Karson was seriously injured along with another adult.\nBrown is the daughter of former St. Peters mayor Shawn Brown. She was living in Kansas City with her son.\n\u201cThey both just had those brilliant blue eyes and those long eye lashes,\u201d said Carissa Figgins. Figgins is the executive director of Sparrow\u2019s Nest in St. Charles, a home for pregnant teenagers. Brown lived at Sparrow\u2019s Nest and became like family to Figgins. \u201cFor this to happen, it\u2019s just unreal,\u201d said Figgins.\nBrown\u2019s brother Trent Brown who also lives in Kansas City said they have heard very little from police.\nInvestigators released a vague description of the suspects on Saturday, but no further information on the quintuple shooting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible that she\u2019s gone, it hurts,\u201d said Brown over the phone. He is heading to St. Louis for his sister\u2019s funeral.\nBrown said his nephew Karson is miraculously expected to survive after being shot five times in the incident.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be in the hospital for a great deal of time, a lot of things to recover from,\u201d said Figgins.\nFiggins said Karson was Ali\u2019s whole world.\n\u201cAny teaching moment we gave her she just took it in and tried to be the best mom that she could for Karson,\u201d said Figgins. \u201cShe was very vivacious, very energetic, very happy and trying to make everyone happy around her.\u201d\nBoth Figgins and Brown\u2019s family said they will do everything they can to help the two-year-old get through this tragic time.\n\u201cAs a community, whether it\u2019s in St. Charles or Kansas City we can\u2019t allow Karson\u2019s life to be a tragedy, for all the love, for all the attention that Ali poured into her son, we can\u2019t let his life be for naught.\u201d\nThe family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with funeral expenses and future needs for Karson.\nCopyright 2016 KMOV (Meredith Corporation).
