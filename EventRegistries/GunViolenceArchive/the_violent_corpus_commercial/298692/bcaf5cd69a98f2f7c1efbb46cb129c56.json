Brown County Coroner Michael Carlsen says he's waiting for lab results to determine an official cause of death. Brown County Sheriff Chief Deputy Tom Schmitt says evidence gathered during the sheriff's office investigation points to the teenager accidentally shooting himself.\nAccording to Frederick Area School superintendent Justin Downes, community members from towns in the area are coming together to show support. People from the school and community have created t-shirts to honor Kenser and support his family. Hundreds of them have already sold.\nOrganizers will sell them at Monday night's district basketball game in Aberdeen when Leola/Frederick plays Northwestern. Downes says people from multiple communities have already purchased shirts so he's expecting to see fans of different teams wearing them at tonight's games as well.\nDownes says Kenser was a freshman and played basketball. He has an older brother on the team who will wear his younger brother's jersey during the game.\n\u00a9 2017 KELOLAND TV. All Rights Reserved."}
