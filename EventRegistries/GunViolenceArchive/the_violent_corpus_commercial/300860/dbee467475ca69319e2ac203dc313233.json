Up to 30 shots were fired into a crowd of around 200 people in the parking lot.\nMinutes later, another person was fatally shot at a nearby ARCO gas station. A car that had previously been seen at the club was located at the second crime scene, police said. Several vehicles were also hit during the shootings.\nPolice said it started earlier in the evening when a group of people had been denied entry into the club because security recognized them as gang rivals of patrons who were already inside.\nAfter they were turned away, they hung around the parking lot, and police were called to remove them from the property. The group left when police arrived, but returned to confront the other group as the club was closing.\nInvestigators said the club has been linked to criminal activity in the past.\nThe two men who were killed have been identified as Petetrial Michael Scott and Jerry Jamale Jackson.\nAn additional five people were hurt, with two in critical condition.\nInvestigators are asking anyone with information to call the San Bernardino Police Department at 909-384-5742.\nTony Shin contributed to this report."}
