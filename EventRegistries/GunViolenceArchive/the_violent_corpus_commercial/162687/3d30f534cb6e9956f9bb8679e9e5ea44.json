This is probably going to be the retaliation shooting,\u201d said Lt. Andrew Schurman, of Allegheny County Police. \u201cMid-morning on Patterson Avenue in Rankin, there was a young man shot. Again, he was taken to a local area hospital listed in stable condition.\u201d\nAllegheny County emergency crews were called to the scene. Multiple police departments were also on scene into the evening collecting evidence, including North Braddock, East Pittsburgh and Allegheny County Police.\nOne neighbor reportedly heard screaming and as many as six gunshots.\n\u201cI heard gunshots,\u201d said Katherine Gee, a neighbor. \u201cI heard about six of them. Not too long after I heard it, I heard people screaming and hollering. But I didn\u2019t know exactly where it was coming from, but as soon as they came around the bend, everyone came out. After that, it\u2019s been chaos ever since.\u201d\nAnother neighbor reported hearing between 13 to 15 shots.\nThere\u2019s no word of any arrests in the incident.\nAll four victims are listed in stable condition at various local hospitals.\nMeanwhile, Allegheny County Police believe a report of shots fired Wednesday evening in Rankin is connected to the North Braddock shooting as well.\nWitnesses saw a man leaning out of one car firing shots at another.\nIt happened near Hawkins Village.\nPolice inspected two vehicles, one of which had the windows shot out; however, there are no reports that anyone was injured.\nHousing Authority Police detained five people. It remains to be seen what charges they may face.\nAllegheny County Police are trying to sort it all out, but they believe it\u2019s the latest in a day long back and forth of shots fired that are probably connected.\nThe investigation continues.\nStay with KDKA for the latest on this developing story."}
