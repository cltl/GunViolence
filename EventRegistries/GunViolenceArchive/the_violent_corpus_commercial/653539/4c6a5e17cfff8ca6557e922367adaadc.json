He crashed into several parked cars, police said, and was found sitting outside the car when police arrived.\nMultiple shots were fired at the vehicle, and another man inside escaped without injury, police said.\nThe killing of Guzman and the shooting on Monday come amid a spike in reports of gunfire in Hempstead, according to Village Police Chief Michael McGowan. Before June, the village averaged about one shooting a month. In June, there were three; five in July; six in August and nine so far in September, said McGowan. Not all of the shootings resulted in a victim, McGowan said, but the chief said they all appear to be related to gang warfare.\nIn one shooting in late August, three men \u2014 ages 17, 19 and 20 \u2014 were shot on Terrace Avenue in Hempstead. McGowan said the shooting appears to be gang related. No arrests have been made.\n\u201cClearly in the last few weeks, in the last few months, there seems to be an uptick in shooting incidents that involve gang activity,\u201d said Skrynecki. \u201cWe are keeping a very close eye on that here in Nassau ... This is something that we are combating at all times and there are peaks and valleys with this type of activity. Things pop up, and we are generally successful at identifying the people involved and making arrests.\u201d\n\u2014 With Ellen Yan"}
