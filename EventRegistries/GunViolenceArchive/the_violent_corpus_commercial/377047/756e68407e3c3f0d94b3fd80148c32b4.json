(WHAS11) \u2013 Louisville Metro Police continue to search for the man who walked into a packed west end club early Sunday morning and fired shots into the crowd. Witnesses said a man, dressed in all white, entered Cole's Place around 3 a.m. Sunday and started shooting.\nSix people were injured in the shooting spree, including a woman who was eight months pregnant. The woman was forced to give birth early but the mother and her new baby girl are reportedly doing well.\nCrystal Teasley was at Cole's Place this weekend when the gunman burst into the club and started shooting. Her son, Kendall, was among the six people who sustained gunshot wounds. Teasley said they were there to celebrate his 21st birthday.\n\"Everybody was having a good time and right at 3 o'clock shots got fired we all took off running and my son was like, 'I'm hit!' And when we turned around [Kendall] was on the ground along with my nephew and three or four other people,\" Teasley recalled. \"I kinda feel like it is my fault because if I wouldn't have had the birthday party, he might not have got hit.\"\nKendall was shot three times. Teasley said he is connected to a chest tube and has no feeling in his right hand. She said rehabilitating his hand will be a priority because her son is a basketball player. The former Valley High School athlete has aspirations of someday playing basketball on a professional level.\nTeasley said seeing her son suffer brought back dark memories from February 2005 when her husband, Michael Teasley, was murdered at a nightclub. The venue, Club 502, was shut down shortly after the shooting.\n\"We were doing security at Club 502 and we had put a guy out of the club and he came back and told my husband he was gonna get him,\" Teasley said. \"After the club let out we was clearing the lot and he came back and shot him five times.\"\nTeasley said she is amazed no one was killed in the shooting Sunday morning. She's praying the suspect, who remains at large, will soon be apprehended.\n\"Wherever he's at he should be sick inside because besides my son and the other people --that lady was pregnant ... that baby was innocent,\" Teasley said with her voice full of emotion. \"Whoever did it -- he might not be done.\"\nEveryone who was shot suffered what are believed to be non-life threatening injuries. Teasley said her nephew, Deandre Strewsberry, is home from the hospital and is doing well. She said a bullet went through his leg. It's unclear how long her son Kendall will have to be hospitalized.\nAnyone with information on this shooting can call the Louisville Metro Police Department tip line, 574-LMPD."}
