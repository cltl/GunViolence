And while they don\u2019t blame the boy who accidentally shot their child \u2013 they believe his parents, the owners of the shotgun, should be prosecuted.\n\u201cThose were Eddie\u2019s friends,\u201d said a sobbing Sandra Aponte Holmes, Eddie\u2019s mother. \u201cMy heart does go out to them, but Eddie\u2019s not here.\u201d\nAn emotional Holmes family still struggles to cope with the loss Eddie.\n\u201cMy brother, he was a good kid,\u201d said Eddie\u2019s older brother, Jose Holmes. \u201cGreat personality that everybody could love.\u201d\nThe shooting happened last week inside a home on 11th Street in Puyallup. Five boys were inside when one of them pulled out his stepfather\u2019s shotgun from behind a bedroom headboard.\nOne of the boys pumped the shotgun \u2013 and it fired directly into Eddie\u2019s chest, killing him.\nPolice call the shooting an accident but the shooter was arrested and faced a judge last Friday. The 13-year-old suspect was released from juvenile detention on Tuesday while prosecutors continued looking at all the evidence in the case.\nEddie\u2019s family says the shotgun owner should have made sure the gun couldn\u2019t fall into a child\u2019s hands.\n\u201cBecause our state has yet to agree on locking and securing guns, I\u2019m left with the unbearable task of planning the funeral of my 13-year-old son,\u201d said Sandra.\nProsecutors say the shooter\u2019s parents could face charges but so far none have been filed.\n\u201cIt is my hope that speaking out today motivates just one person to secure their gun, my son Eddie Zee Holmes\u2019 life would not have been taken in vain,\u201d said Sandra.\nShe hopes gun owners across Washington state will take better care to store and secure their firearms.\n\u201cAs only a mother whose child has been killed by gun violence can know, this pain that I am feeling is so unbearable,\u201d said Sandra.\nEddie\u2019s funeral is Saturday at New Tacoma Cemetery at 1 p.m. The family says the public is invited to attend."}
