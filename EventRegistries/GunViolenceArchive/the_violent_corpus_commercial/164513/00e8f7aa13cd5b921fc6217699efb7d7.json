Three days before the incident, on a Wednesday, Joel and Heather Smith went to pick up the three children from their paternal grandfather, with whom they\u2019d been staying during Heather\u2019s rehabilitation stint.\nThe night before the crime, Heather Smith passed a drug test, but abruptly left a group therapy session halfway through the meeting with no explanation. Police would later report that on the same night, Joel Smith threatened suicide, although it is unclear whether, or in what way, the two circumstances are related.\nAccording to the medical examiner\u2019s report, Joel Smith had visited doctors at least four times between June 2013 and February 2014 seeking help for stress and anxiety, among other things. Those visits came on the heels of what the report suggested were numerous previous attempts to seek medical help since 2008, when Smith told doctors he lost his job and his anxiety became \u201cintolerable.\u201d\n\u201cHe had done well on [the antidepressant] sertraline, but lost his insurance and had not been taking sertraline for several months. His anxiety had returned with panic symptoms, obsessive worrying and difficulty sleeping,\u201d read the medical examiner\u2019s recounting of Joel Smith\u2019s Feb. 28 appointment with his primary care physician. \u201cHe rarely drank and denied recreational drugs. He denied depression and suicidal and homicidal ideation. The impression was generalized anxiety and panic disorder. Sertraline, 50 mg daily, was prescribed. He was to return in one month. There were no further visits.\u201d\nThe report did not indicate why he lost his insurance or whether he regained coverage, but by July 26, Joel Smith was apparently not using any antidepressants. The medical examiner\u2019s office found only cotinine, a byproduct of tobacco use, in his system.\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office found what it called \u201ca therapeutic level\u201d of hydrocodone in Heather Smith\u2019s system, as well as a peripheral blood alcohol content of 0.23.\nMuch of the rest of the reports released Monday support state and local police accounts in the immediate aftermath of the incident.\nThe three children who were home at the time died of two shotgun shots apiece. The youngest, 4-year-old Lily, was found in bed next to her mother in what appeared to be the master bedroom.\nHeather Smith and Joel Smith each died of a single shotgun wound to the head.\nPolice have surmised that Joel Smith, who was found beside the master bed next to the murder weapon, killed Jason Montez and Noah Montez in their bedrooms before continuing to the master bedroom, where he shot Lily Smith twice, Heather Smith once and then himself.\nJoel and Heather Smith had been together 12 years, and moved from Arizona to Maine approximately four years ago."}
