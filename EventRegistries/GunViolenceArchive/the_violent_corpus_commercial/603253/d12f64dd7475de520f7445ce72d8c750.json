A person called 911 at 8:38 a.m. to report a boy had shot himself.\nThe names of the parents and the boy were not being released Thursday.\n\u201cWe want to make sure that all the family members have been contacted,\u201d Routt County Coroner Rob Ryg said.\nThe Routt County Sheriff\u2019s Office was investigating the shooting and had called the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to help.\nUndersheriff Ray Birch would not say if the boy was alone when he was shot or what kind of gun he was shot with. He would also not say whether the boy was shot with a gun issued by the police department.\n\u201cI cannot give you details of our investigator\u2019s interview with the parents, at this point,\u201d Birch said.\nAfter the boy was shot, he was driven toward Steamboat by his father and a friend. They were met on the way by Steamboat Springs Fire Rescue paramedics, who then took the boy to Yampa Valley Medical Center.\n\u201cIt was a number of hours before we received the sad news that he passed,\u201d Birch said.\nBirch said they were in the process of reconstructing what happened inside the home.\nBirch said it was hard to find the words to describe how the law enforcement community was feeling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very emotional,\u201d Birch said. \u201cWe\u2019re like a family. We\u2019re very close.\u201d\nTo reach Matt Stensland, call 970-871-4247, email mstensland@SteamboatToday.com or follow him on Twitter @SBTStensland"}
