After seeing he was fine, Joni Stiles ran downstairs and saw Gavin on the floor of the master bedroom.\nJoni Stiles told deputies that she \"immediately knew.\" She picked up Gavin and brought him to his father and yelled that Gavin had shot himself.\nGavin was conscious, and Michael Stiles applied direct pressure to the wound. A construction worker, who is a trained emergency medical technician, rushed Gavin and Michael Stiles toward Steamboat, where they met an ambulance near the entrance to Lake Catamount.\nBefore going to the hospital, Joni Stiles went back in the master bedroom. She saw a gun and a bag on the floor.\nAt the hospital, deputies interviewed Michael Stiles. He said all the guns in the house had been \"put up.\"\n\"If he was in my room, he climbed up in the closet and pulled my bag down,\" Michael Stiles told investigators.\nHe said the bag contained items he needed to respond to an emergency, including a .45-caliber, semi-automatic Glock issued to him by the police department.\nMichael Stiles guessed that Gavin could have climbed a dresser or another piece of furniture to access the bag.\nSteamboat Police Chief Cory Christensen on Tuesday said it was not unusual for police officers to keep their guns loaded when they are stored.\nOn Thursday, members of a grand jury that met in secret to review the case decided not to indict Joni or Michael Stiles.\nWith the criminal process now complete, a sergeant at the police department has been assigned to determine if any policies were violated.\nMichael Stiles requested a six-month, unpaid leave of absence after the shooting.\nThe police department's policy manual specifically addresses how officers should store their firearms at home. It states: \"Members shall ensure that all firearms and ammunition are locked and secured while in their homes, vehicles or any other area under their control, and in a manner that will keep them inaccessible to children and others who should not have access.\"\nChristensen said that is a standard policy, and he thinks it is clear.\n\"I don't think I can think of a better way of saying that,\" Christensen said.\nHe said the policy has been discussed at length with all the officers at the department.\n\"A sensitive topic but important for us to talk about,\" Christensen said.\nTo reach Matt Stensland, call 970-871-4247, email mstensland@SteamboatToday.com or follow him on Twitter @SBTStensland"}
