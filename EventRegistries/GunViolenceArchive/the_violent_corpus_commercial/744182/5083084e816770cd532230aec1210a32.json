He is suffering from major head trauma and will need a lot of after care when he wakes up.\nUntil we have a better idea about how it will be for him this money will initially be used for his mom so that she can stay with him the duration of his hospital stay out of town. Hopefully we will soon know the specific treatments that he will need but for now it is important she stay here will him. Please pray for him. Thank you."}
