He cracked the door open, saw it was a police officer and called for help.\n\"It\u2019s kind of incomprehensible,\" Stepenosky said. \"You go to the airport to go to a wedding ... and now he's in a hospital.\"\nFriends, family members and colleagues were by the hospital bedside of the Calabasas teacher.\n\"He sounds great, given what he\u2019s gone through,\" Stepenosky said. \"He\u2019s optimistic and upbeat, and he sounds exhausted.\"\nLudmer was one of five people shot during the rampage, including one Transportation Security Administration officer who was killed.\nPolice blame Friday's rampage on suspect Paul Anthony Ciancia, a 23-year-old New Jersey native, who opened fire at a TSA document checkpoint of Terminal 3 of the Bradley International Terminal.\nThe FBI announced Saturday that federal prosecutors will file murder charges against Ciancia in connection with the shooting.\nMore Southern California Stories:"}
