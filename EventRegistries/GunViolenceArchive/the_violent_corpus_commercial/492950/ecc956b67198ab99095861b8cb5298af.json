Introduction and Executive Summary\nOn November 1, 2013, the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) was the scene of an unconscionable act\nof violence by a lone gunman who murdered a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) official and\nwounded two others along with one airline passenger. The entire LAX community was devastated by this\nsenseless loss of life and continues to mourn the death of Transportation Security Officer (TSO) Gerardo\nHernandez, who dedicated his life to faithfully protecting his fellow citizens from similar acts of violence.\nThe shooting of Officer Hernandez triggered one of the largest multi-jurisdictional law enforcement\noperations in the Los Angeles region in recent years. It also had cascading effects that rippled across the\nairport for the better part of two days, impacting about 1,500 flights and 171,000 passengers and\ndisrupting the operations of the entire air transportation system. LAX spans more than 3,425 acres and\ncontains nine passenger terminals that served nearly 66.7 million passengers in 2013. Law enforcement\nand emergency response operations at the airport are complex. Airport emergencies typically require a\nhigh degree of multiagency and public/private sector coordination in an effort to assure public security,\nand respond and recover from a disruptive event as safely and rapidly as possible.\nIn light of the lethal and uncertain nature of the security threat that emerged on November 1, the need\nto manage the situation with extreme caution, and the overall complexity of the airport environment, it\nis remarkable that the majority of the LAX Central Terminal Area (CTA) was returned to normal\noperations within a matter of hours. Almost as notable was the fact that Terminal 3, the scene of a\nhorrific crime, was also returned to full service the following day on November 2.\nThe successful response and recovery to the active shooter incident and the airport-wide disruption that\nfollowed is largely attributable to several key factors:\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The Los Angeles World Airports Police Division and City of Los Angeles Police Department officers\nwho initially responded did so as a team, with courage, skill, and professionalism.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 There was an immediate and substantial multiagency response by other public safety organizations\nfrom across the region, to include the Los Angeles City Fire Department and local police agencies.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 A unified multiagency command was established and maintained throughout, to include the direct\ninvolvement of airport operations.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The entire response team was leaning hard on two overarching objectives: protecting the people\nat LAX from any further harm, and verifying the safety of the airport to facilitate its rapid recovery.\nWhile the overall response was successful, there were key lessons learned that indicate the need for\nimprovement by Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) in partnership with its public safety partners:\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Emergency alert and warning systems, to include duress phones or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Red Phones,\u00e2\u20ac need to be\nupdated and the technologies for 911 notifications to Airport Police must be better integrated.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Although the emphasis on multiagency coordination and unified command was very strong among\nthe agencies participating, there needs to be continuing emphasis on incident command basics.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 2 Introduction and Executive Summary\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 While major efforts were made to use social networking and commercial media to inform the\ngeneral public, public mass notification within the airport was lacking and must be addressed.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Even though significant attention and resources have been applied, the observations in this report\nindicate a need to take a more focused risk-based approach to security and preparedness.\nOverview of the Incident\nAt approximately 9:18 AM PST on November 1, 2013, an armed gunman entered Terminal 3 at Los\nAngeles International Airport. The suspect approached a TSA Officer and fired at point blank range,\nkilling the Officer within minutes. The suspect then made his way through the concourse shooting and\nwounding several other victims, including two TSOs and one passenger. At 9:20 AM, Los Angeles World\nAirports Police Division (LAWAPD) and Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) dispatch centers began\nreceiving emergency calls about the shooting and immediately broadcast notifications to units in the\nvicinity. At 9:25 AM, LAWAPD officers reported that the suspect was down at Gate 35 and, thirty\nseconds later, those officers had the suspect firmly in custody.\nOnce Terminal 3 was secured, emphasis transitioned to police clearing operations across the rest of the\nLAX CTA. Meanwhile, Airport Operations focused on passenger assistance and mass care for the\napproximately 4,500 passengers who self-evacuated from Terminals 1, 2, and 3 and the more than\n20,000 passengers who were sheltered in place on aircraft, and in terminals. At approximately 2:00 PM,\nairline employees and flight crews were allowed to re-enter the CTA to prepare for normal operations.\nAt 4:00 PM, all screening checkpoints, except for Terminal 3, were reactivated and the CTA was opened\nfor all vehicle traffic at 6:51 PM. Terminal 3 reopened at 1:05 PM on November 2.\nResponse and recovery efforts lasted approximately 30 hours. Throughout that period, personnel from\nfirst responder agencies, tenants, airport executives and employees, and mutual aid agencies worked\ntirelessly to isolate and clear every threat, provide mass care for all passengers, and keep the public\ninformed with the best information possible. While the shooting was limited to the confines of Terminal\n3 and only lasted a few minutes, the cascading effects were felt throughout the airport and the\nimmediate surrounding area, with over 1,500 flights and 171,000 passengers affected.\nApproach\nImmediately following the active shooter event and the airport-wide disruption that followed over the\ncourse of November 1 and 2, 2013, LAWA Executive Director commissioned a comprehensive review of\nthe emergency. On November 5, 2013, the Board of Airport Commissioners convened a special four-\nhour meeting and directed staff to include in the review a thorough assessment of the multiagency\nemergency response effort and identify lessons learned and areas requiring improvement. The LAWA\nreview involved a wide cross-section of stakeholder input and had two main components: 1) work by\nLAWA staff through two multidisciplinary working groups \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one focused on public safety and one on\nairport operations and emergency management; and 2) assistance by an outside consultant to collect\nand analyze the input provided by the two working groups and prepare a consolidated report. An\noverview this review was shared with the Board of Airport Commissioners on February 3, 2013.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nIntroduction and Executive Summary Page 3\nMajor Observations and Recommendations\nTo provide focus for LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts toward continuous improvement in its security and emergency\npreparedness programs, the following seven priority observations merit special consideration.

Background\nAirport Orientation\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX) spans more than 3,425 acres, contains nine passenger terminals,\nand provides 12,500 parking stalls for travelers. As of 2013, it was the sixth busiest airport in the world\nand third busiest in the United States, offering 680 daily flights to 96 domestic cities and 910 weekly\nnonstop flights to 59 cities in 30 countries on 60 commercial air carriers. It ranked 14th in the world and\nfifth in the U.S. in air cargo tonnage processed. With 95 passenger and cargo airlines, LAX is the primary\nairport serving the Greater Los Angeles Area. It is located in southwestern Los Angeles along the Pacific\ncoast in the neighborhood of Westchester, 16 miles from Downtown Los Angeles. LAX is owned and\noperated by Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), an agency of the Los Angeles city government.\nIn 2013, LAX served nearly 66.7 million passengers, it processed over 1.9 million tons of air cargo valued\nat over $86.9 billion, and handled 614,917 aircraft operations (landings and takeoffs). An economic\nimpact study reported that operations at LAX generated 294,400 jobs in Los Angeles County with labor\nincome of $13.6 billion and economic output of more than $39.7 billion. This activity added $2.5 billion\nto local and state revenues.\nFigure 1: Los Angeles International Airport\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 6 Background\nThe Central Terminal Area or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CTA\u00e2\u20ac is the central complex of LAX and is shown in Figure 2. It features\nnine passenger terminals connected by a U-shaped, two-level roadway. Terminals 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 8 service\ndomestic travel. The ninth terminal is the Tom Bradly International Terminal (TBIT) at the west end,\nwhich hosts LAX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international airlines and travelers.\nThe CTA comprises two levels: Check-in and Departures are on the upper level and Baggage Claim and\nArrivals on the lower level. Restaurants, cocktail lounges, gift shops, newsstands, duty free shops for\ninternational flights, restrooms, public telephones, business centers, airline lounges, and other\nconvenient services for the traveling public are located throughout the terminals.\nTerminal 3, the scene of the active shooter event on November 1, 2013, is located at the northwest\ncorner of the CTA, in close proximity to the Tom Bradly International Terminal, and opposite Terminal 4,\nwhich sits on the southwest corner of the CTA.\nFigure 2: Los Angeles International Airport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Central Terminal Area (CTA)\nScene of the Active Shooter Incident\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nBackground Page 7\nOverview of Public Safety\nPrimary responsibility for law enforcement and security at LAWA facilities, to include LAX, rests with the\nLAWA Police Division (LAWAPD). Having a dedicated police force has proved vital considering the\nairport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role as an international gateway and its prominence as a possible target of crime and terrorism.\nLAX is also a nexus for the activities of a variety of local, State and federal law enforcement agencies to\ninclude the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD); Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Transportation\nSecurity Administration (TSA); Customs and Border Protection (CBP); Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement (ICE); and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). In addition, the Los Angeles City Fire\nDepartment (LAFD) provides fire-fighting and emergency medical services. The LAWA Office of\nOperations and Emergency Management administer planning, training, and exercise programs for LAX,\nand supports LAWAPD and allied public safety agencies in any emergency response.\nLAWA Police Division (LAWAPD) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Consisting of roughly 1,110 police, security officers, and civilian\nstaff, LAWAPD is the largest force of its kind solely dedicated to airport policing in the Nation. The\nChief of Police leads LAWAPD and reports to the Deputy Executive Director for Homeland Security and\nLaw Enforcement. Three Assistant Chiefs provide leadership for subordinate activities to include\nOperations, Support Services, and Homeland Security and Intelligence.\nIn addition to its patrol force, LAWAPD capabilities include K-9 bomb detection teams; traffic control\nvia security officers and motorcycle and bicycle units; a commercial vehicle enforcement unit; and a\nsecurity and access control unit that regulates entry into sensitive areas of the airport. Other\nspecialized activities include critical infrastructure protection, emergency services, and vulnerability\nassessment and analysis. LAPD also patrols the airport under a joint agreement and provides the\nLAWAPD with support when needed, to include Bomb Squad, Hazardous Materials, and Special\nWeapons and Tactics units.\nLos Angeles City Fire Department (LAFD) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LAFD provides aircraft rescue and firefighting, structural\nfirefighting, and emergency medical services (EMS) support to LAX. Specifically, Fire Station 80 and\nFire Station 51, which belong to LAFD Battalion 4, provide these services to LAX. Battalion 4 includes\nfive other stations covering a 23-square mile area around the airport. Among them is Fire Station 5\nthat lies in close proximity to the northeast perimeter of LAX. LAFD also maintains routine liaison with\nLAX through an Assistant Chief assigned to coordinate all airport related activities with the LAWA\nDeputy Executive Director for Homeland Security and Law Enforcement and in turn, the Chief of\nLAWAPD and LAWA Emergency Management.\nLAWA Emergency Management Division (EMD) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LAWA EMD resides within the Office of Operations\nand Emergency Management. The Division manages a program of emergency management planning\nthat encompasses the development and maintenance of all Airport Emergency Plans (AEPs) and a full\nportfolio of AEP annexes that provide detailed guidance for AEP execution. EMD administers FEMA\nsanctioned incident command training for LAWA staff and implements a supporting program of FAA\nmandated and supplemental exercises to validate AEP assumptions and reinforce skills acquired\nthrough structured training. EMD is also the custodian of the Department Operations Center (DOC).\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 8 Background\nSequence of Events\nIn the week following the active shooter incident of November 1, 2013, a Joint Public Safety Working\nGroup was formed consisting of the Los Angeles World Airports Police Division (LAWAPD), Los Angeles\nPolice Department (LAPD), and Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD). Facilitated by the LAWA Deputy\nExecutive Director for Homeland Security and Law Enforcement, the group conducted a Public Safety\nfocused review of the incident to assess lessons learned and identify opportunities for improvement.\nIn the course of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review, it considered the chronology of events as they unfolded and in so\ndoing, consulted a range of official records. These included dispatch voice recorder logs, video recorder\nlogs, Mobile Data Terminal logs, and dispatch records. Where records were not available, the group\ninterviewed individual responders to fill in any gaps. The following has been taken from the work of that\nreview. An expanded representation of these same events is contained in Appendix B.\nThe Initial Shooting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c At approximately 9:18 AM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on November 1, 2013, an\narmed gunman entered Terminal 3 concealing a semiautomatic weapon, five 30-round magazines, and\nhundreds of additional rounds of ammunition contained in boxes. Within two minutes of arrival, the\nsuspect approached the passenger queue line at the base of the escalator leading to the screening\ncheckpoint and fired multiple rounds into a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Officer (TSO)\nat point blank range. As shots rang out, nearby TSOs and passengers took cover or fled the immediate\narea at the base of the escalator. The suspect began to proceed up the escalator, paused, and\nreturned to the screening checkpoint and fired additional shots into the previously hit victim at point\nblank range. Afterwards, the suspect continued up the escalator towards the screening checkpoint.\nAdvance Through the Terminal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c At the top of the escalator, most passengers and TSA security\npersonnel within the screening checkpoint self-evacuated when the initial shots were fired. Many fled\ninto the concourse area or through doors leading them onto the airfield; those that stayed within the\nterminal hid inside stores, closets, restrooms, and behind other forms of cover. After the suspect\nwalked past several passengers and through the exit lane of the screening checkpoint into the\nconcourse area, passengers fled the terminal toward the street exits. The suspect made his way\nthrough the concourse, shooting at fleeing passengers and TSOs wounding several victims, including\ntwo TSOs and one passenger. Each victim was able to flee or take cover after being wounded.\nCalls to Police \u00e2\u20ac\u201c At 9:20 AM PST, LAWAPD and LAPD communications centers began receiving\nemergency calls about the shooting via mobile phone and emergency direct-connect \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Red Phones\u00e2\u20ac\nlocated at screening checkpoints. Dispatchers immediately broadcast notifications on their respective\nfrequencies, LAWAPD and LAPD Pacific (PAC), and dispatched several units to LAX Terminal 3.\nPursuit of the Suspect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c At 9:22 AM PST, many LAWAPD officers converged at Terminal 3\naccompanied by CBP and LAPD officer(s) on regular assignment to LAX, accessing multiple entries and\nexits (e.g., airfield doors, pedestrian bridges, upper and lower levels, etc.) to enter the facility. To\nprevent additional casualties, the police officers quickly formed into strike teams and entered the\nconcourse to stop the active shooter and secure the area as quickly as possible. At 9:24 AM PST,\nLAWAPD ordered the closure of all roadways into the CTA. Airfield perimeter security access posts\nwere also ordered locked-down as a protective measure.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nBackground Page 9\nShooter in Custody \u00e2\u20ac\u201c At about 9:25 AM PST, LAWAPD reported that the suspect was down at Gate 35;\n30 seconds later LAWAPD had the suspect in custody. LAWAPD and LAPD then worked together to\nsecure the crime scene and search the terminal for other possible suspects and threats, such as\nimprovised explosive devices. As teams progressed through the terminal, they attended to the\nwounded, and cleared hiding passengers and directed them to exit the terminal.\nSecurity Operations and Emergency Response \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Beginning at 9:20 AM PST and for almost the next 6\nhours, passengers evacuated from or sheltered-in-place within the terminals. Once outside, evacuees\nwere directed toward witness collection points at the TBIT. LAWAPD supervisors then ordered that a\nperimeter be established around the terminal and a systematic search be conducted of the airfield. At\n9:32 AM PST, as the search for additional threats continued, an Incident Command Post (ICP) was\nestablished on the east end of Terminal 3. LAFD staged its vehicles at the east end of Terminal 2 and\nalso established a street-side triage area. At 9:48 AM PST, the LAWA DOC was activated to support\nthe multiagency response. These efforts included the movement of self-evacuees from Terminals 1, 2,\nand 3 to TBIT, relieving and providing provisions for passengers sheltering on over 10 aircraft, as well\nas providing mass care for individuals once they were relocated to a secure facility. The provision of\nmass care was not limited to evacuated passengers, but included providing individual assistance and\nbehavioral health services to responders, airport tenants, and employees.\nBecause of ongoing responder activities and the large number of self-evacuees on the airfield,\nLAWAPD requested that all traffic and operations on the airfield be shut down at 10:03 AM PST. At\n10:16 AM PST, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a Tier 1 ground stop for LAX arrivals\nbecause of the buildup of aircraft on the airfield. Responding units worked through this period to\nclear the 301 and 401 parking structures, Terminal 3, and the airfield between Terminals 3 and 2.\nAirport Recovery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As the initial response phase wound down, the first press conference was\nconducted at 11:52 AM PST. It included the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles, the LAWA Executive\nDirector, and LAWAPD, LAPD, and LAFD representatives. At approximately 2:00 PM PST, airline\nemployees and flight crews were allowed to re-enter the CTA to prepare for normal operations. All\nairfield access posts were re-opened at 3:20 PM PST and passengers and employees who sheltered-in-\nplace were allowed to leave. At 4:00 PM PST, all screening checkpoints, except for Terminal 3, were\nreactivated and the CTA was opened for all vehicle traffic at 6:51 PM PST. Terminal 3 remained closed\nuntil the investigation and rehabilitation was completed at 1:05 PM PST on November 2, 2013.\nResponse and recovery efforts lasted approximately 30 hours. Throughout this period, all personnel --\nfrom first responders, tenants, airport executives, employees, and mutual-aid agencies -- worked\ntirelessly to isolate and clear every threat, provide mass care for all passengers, and keep the public\ninformed with the best information possible. While the shooting was limited to the confines of Terminal\n3 and only lasted a few minutes, the cascading effects were felt throughout the airport and the\nimmediate surrounding area; over 1,500 flights and 171,000 passengers were affected.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 10 Background\nApproach\nImmediately following the active shooter event and the airport-wide disruption that followed over the\ncourse of November 1 and 2, 2013, LAWA Executive Director commissioned a comprehensive review of\nthe emergency. On November 5, 2013, the Board of Airport Commissioners convened a special four-\nhour meeting and directed staff to include in the review a thorough assessment of the whole of the\nmultiagency emergency response effort and identify lessons learned and areas requiring improvement.\nThat LAWA review involved a wide cross-section of stakeholder input and had two main components: 1)\nwork by LAWA staff through two stakeholder working groups, one focused on public safety and one\nfocused on airport operations and emergency management; and 2) assistance by an outside consultant\nto collect and analyze the input provided by the two working groups and prepare a consolidated report.\nLAWA Staff Working Groups\nJoint Public Safety Working Group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As a part of the LAWA-wide review process, a Joint Public Safety\nWorking Group was formed consisting of the LAWAPD, LAPD, and LAFD. This work spanned a range of\nissues related to: prevention and preparedness; incident detection and notifications; use of video\nsurveillance; police and EMS capabilities; radio communications interoperability; and emergency\nevacuation of airport terminals.\nOperations and Emergency Management Working Group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As a complement to and in close\ncoordination with the Public Safety group, the focus of this part of the review was on overall\nemergency management operations and the effectiveness of multiagency coordination. The\nOperations and Emergency Management Working Group conducted over 25 stakeholder meetings,\nengaging over 100 people, both internal and external to LAX. This work included outreach across all\nLAWA divisions, city agencies, federal partners (FAA, TSA, CBP), and 25 airlines operating from LAX. An\nintense day-long session was also conducted where senior officials from all of the organizations\ninvolved shared experiences, identified issues, and made suggestions for improvement.\nNational Standards and Best Practice\nTo provide a framework for the collection of information and guide the analysis of input provided from\nthe two LAWA stakeholder working groups, a set of nationally recognized standards and best practices\nwere applied. These standards provided an objective basis from which to conduct additional fact-\nfinding on emerging issues and helped shape development of recommendations. They included:\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The National Preparedness System (NPS)\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP)\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The National Fire Protection Association Standard 1600 (NFPA 1600) Of fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nBackground Page 11\nNational Preparedness System (NPS) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As national policy, the NPS provides a universal framework for\nthe risk-based assessment of needs and the more deliberate development of prevention, protection,\nresponse, and recovery capabilities. The NPS encompasses a cycle of continuous improvement in\npreparedness capabilities as described in Figure 3.\nThat cycle begins with the assessment of risks the\nagency is likely to confront, followed by\nexamination of current capabilities and capability\ngaps. Risk-based priorities are then set for the\ndevelopment of needed capabilities. The strength\nof those capabilities are then validated through\ntraining and exercises, and those efforts are\nreviewed and updated on a regular basis as the\ncycle of improvement is repeated to achieve and\nsustain needed capabilities over time.\nNational Incident Management System (NIMS) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\nAs described by FEMA, NIMS identifies concepts\nand principles that guide how to manage\nemergencies, from preparedness through to\nrecovery, regardless of their cause, size, location,\nor complexity. NIMS provides a consistent,\nnationwide approach and vocabulary for multiple agencies or jurisdictions to work together to build,\nsustain, and deliver the core capabilities needed for effective emergency management. A core\ncomponent of NIMS is the Incident Command System (ICS). ICS is a management system designed to\nenable effective and efficient command and control by integrating a combination of personnel,\nfacilities, equipment, and communications assets operating within a unified command (UC) structure.\nICS is a national best practice employed by first responders, civilian agencies, and private sector\norganizations across the country.\nNFPA 1600 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management Programs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c NFPA 1600 establishes a\ncommon set of criteria for all hazards disaster and emergency management programs and provides\nthe fundamental criteria to develop, implement, assess, and maintain prevention, mitigation,\npreparedness, response, and recovery capabilities. It applies equally to public, not-for-profit, and\nnongovernmental entities. NFPA 1600 also lays out a process for review and corrective action to\nensure a common approach is followed in addressing deficiencies and resolving shortfalls.\nThe Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Based largely on NFPA 1600, EMAP is\na voluntary assessment and accreditation process focused at local and state emergency management\nprograms. Applicants engage in self-critique and incremental improvement typically culminating in a\nformal assessment by EMAP evaluators. The process is scalable, and can be applied by any public\nsector organization, whether seeking accreditation or not. Given that the standard represents\nnationally recognized minimum performance criteria, it can also be applied as a tool for strategic\nimprovement in the administration of emergency management programs, like that at LAWA.\nFigure 3: National Preparedness System\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nThis page is intentionally blank\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 13\nIII. Observations and Recommendations\nPublic Safety\nIt is almost impossible for law enforcement to prevent a threat such as the one that occurred at LAX on\nNovember 1, 2013. The response by LAWAPD was immediate and heroic and the threat posed by the\nshooter was ended without additional loss of life due to the training and tactical ability of the officers\ninvolved. However, the event does give the opportunity to pause and consider how a more\nsophisticated shooter, multiple shooters, or simultaneous events should be managed in the future.\nThis section focuses a subset of issues touched on by the Joint Public Safety Working Group, and\nincludes others that have surfaced either through post-event interviews or group debriefing sessions.\nThe discussion below blends these inputs into a refined set of global observations and recommendations\nfor public safety community and LAWA management consideration. Additional observations and\nassociated recommendations related to incident management, response operations, and emergency\npreparedness are reflected in greater detail within the respective sections that follow.\nThe observations below are not intended to be an exhaustive examination of overall security or police\nand fire department tactics during the active shooter incident of November 1, 2013 but are intended to\npoint the way toward some basic improvements and a more holistic and integrated security program.\nJoint Public Safety Review\nIn the week following the active shooter incident of November 1, 2013, a Joint Public Safety Working\nGroup was formed consisting of LAWAPD, LAPD, and LAFD. Facilitated by the LAWA Deputy Executive\nDirector for Homeland Security and Law Enforcement, the group conducted a Public Safety focused\nreview of the incident to assess lessons learned and identify opportunities for improvement.\nThe Public Safety review spanned a range of issues related to: prevention and preparedness; incident\ndetection and notifications; use of video surveillance; police and EMS capabilities; radio communications\ninteroperability; and emergency evacuation of airport terminals. There were also four current security\nand prevention/protection activities that were given special consideration by the group: randomization\nof patrol practices; vehicle screening at checkpoints; use of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras; and\ntactical response operations.\nPatrol Practices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LAWAPD has implemented random patrol and show-of-force tactics designed to\ncontinually change the face of police presence at LAX and make attempts at pre-attack surveillance\nand prediction of police security posture difficult. These Random Action Measures (RAMs) include\ndirected patrol of teams of officers and K-9s to densely populated areas of the airport and special\npatrol details to provide a sudden high visibility police presence at any place or time on the facility.\nOperation Safe Entry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Another RAM tactic is the Operation Safe Entry Vehicle Checkpoint program\nemployed by the LAWAPD. These checkpoints randomly inspect vehicles entering key access points to\nthe LAX CTA. On the morning of November 1, LAWAPD was operating multiple Operation Safe Entry\ncheckpoints. The Public Safety Working Group concluded that it is possible the shooter accessed the\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 14 Observations and Recommendations\nCTA through one of these checkpoints and, if he did, uniformed officers screening vehicles did not\ndeter him nor was he detected at those locations.\nCCTV Employment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LAWAPD has access to CCTV cameras that cover LAX and those cameras were\nintegral to law enforcement and emergency management operations on November 1. The Public\nSafety Review concluded that, in addition to their overall importance to security threat detection and\ninterdiction, with appropriate technological enhancements, LAX surveillance systems can provide even\ngreater value to the management of large-scale incident command operations.\nTactical Response Operations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c In advance of the November 1 incident at LAX, LAWAPD had invested\nand continues to invest significant resources to train its officers in active shooter response tactics, to\ninclude Multi-Assault Counter-Terrorism Action Capabilities (MACTAC). MACTAC involves tactical\nmaneuvers adapted from close-quarter battle tactics develop by the military for use in urban combat,\nbut as adapted for law enforcement. The Public Safety Review credited the effective and speedy\nresolution of the active shooter threat to the MACTAC tactics employed by the officers involved.\nSuccessful employment of MACTAC in complex multi-faceted attacks requires effective multi-agency\nincident command, interoperable communications, resource management and EMS integration, and\nthe right weapons and protective equipment necessary to mount a determined response. The Public\nSafety Working Group subject matter experts identified challenges in each of these areas. Aside from\nthe expected initial confusion that typifies such events, the establishment of Unified Command and\nbuild-out of the ICP was delayed, non-interoperable radio systems caused gaps in cross-agency\ncoordination, and mutual-aid response, though substantial, needed better resource management.\nWhen viewed in the context of the November 1 active shooter incident and, more importantly, with\nrespect to the risk of future armed threats that might be more complex, aggressive, and lethal, the\nlessons learned coming from the Public Safety Working Group review suggest some overarching\nopportunities to strengthen prevention, protection, and response efforts to mitigate the risks associated\nwith future threats. Those opportunities are presented in the Observations that follow.\nObservation 1: Security and Incident Prevention\nPersonnel, procedures, and technology related to the security of the Airport and the public it serves\nmust be layered and fully integrated to ensure a holistic and effective security risk mitigation\nprogram.\nThe nature of criminal activity and the terrorist threat at the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major airports are as complex and\nvaried as the facilities themselves. From petty theft to drug trafficking, criminal activities at airports\nhave always posed unique policing and security challenges. The events of 9/11 focused much attention\non threats to the air transportation system and specifically aircraft. However, well before 9/11, airports\nand the people who populate them have been the target of attacks by terrorists or lone gunmen.\nDespite major investments in airport security across the country, that threat persists. The discussion\nbelow considers the larger implications of the active shooter event of November 1, 2013 for LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\noverall security and incident prevention programs.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 15\nBackground\nAirport police must maintain a robust capacity to interdict armed threats whether by criminals, lone\nshooters, or terrorists using conventional weapons and/or explosives. Plots and armed attacks against\nairports are not without precedent and have been a constant concern for airport authorities worldwide.\nAs history has demonstrated, such threats could be more aggressive and lethal than the events of\nNovember 1, 2013; thus, any evaluation of security effectiveness should not use that incident alone as\nthe benchmark. Had the attacker not been highly selective in his targets, and/or had there been\nmultiple attackers with weapons of greater lethality, the outcome might have been far different.\nAlthough it may not be possible to prevent a major crime or attack on an airport, it is possible to identify\nits potential, deter its occurrence, and respond to a threat once it has materialized. An ability to carry\nout these actions places a premium on intelligence, private sector/civilian engagement, security design\nand systems, situational awareness, interoperable communications, command and control, operational\ncapability, and a high level of coordination, not only among law enforcement agencies but also with\ncivilian stakeholders and security counterparts. Whether focused on thwarting crime or violent attacks,\nsecurity operations should be risk-based, holistic, layered, and well-integrated, as described below:\nRisk-Based \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Airports are highly complex systems, with a wide array of potential threats and\nvulnerabilities to be considered. However, simply adding more security does not necessarily provide\nbetter security. Determining priorities and where to achieve greatest value for the dollars invested\nrequires regular, systematic assessment of the likelihood and consequences (or risks) associated with\na range of threat scenarios that morph and change more quickly now than ever before. Collaborative\nengagement in a security risk assessment process across the airport community builds the buy-in\nneeded to develop and sustain a holistic security program over time. Not all risk reduction strategies\nyield the same value and what may have been a prudent measure at one point in time may need to be\nreevaluated as the threat evolves and conditions change. Leaders must be open to challenging\nestablished practices and demonstrate a willingness to change direction as needed.\nHolistic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As often happens in complex systems, airport security can evolve in a less than planned way.\nResponsibility for key functions may be divided across organizations, practices and systems may\ndevelop as silos unconnected to the greater whole and, as a result of that fragmentation, holes in the\nfabric of security may develop and new vulnerabilities emerge. An effective risk assessment uncovers\nthose vulnerabilities and provides focus on what is missing or misaligned and suggests ways to fill\nthose gaps. That includes using layers of security that are integrated to leverage a more complete and\nwell-rounded program that is flexible to adjust as risks evolve. Risk and vulnerability assessments of\nLAX will likely continue to be performed by a variety of agencies for different purposes. LAWA must\nwork collaboratively with those agencies to ensure it receives maximum value from those assessments\nand is able to integrate assessment results into its own more holistic risk management program.\nLayered \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Typically the most robust aspects of airport security are at the perimeters and screening\npoints leading into the protected areas. Considerable focus and effort goes into these locations and\noften less so across the rest of the facility. To avoid single points of failure, security strategy must\nfollow a defense-in-depth mindset, where all parts of a layered and interdependent security program\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 16 Observations and Recommendations\n(intelligence, civilian engagement, CCTV and alarms, communications, command and control, and\noperations, etc.) are integrated in concentric rings around the airport and its most critical elements.\nWell-integrated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c All aspects of the security program need to be harmonized and mutually supporting\nin a way that makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts. Operational security (e.g., patrols,\nintelligence, suspicious activity reporting), technological security (e.g., sensors, CCTV, alarms), and\narchitectural security (e.g., fencing, lighting, barriers) all need to evolve with such harmony in mind. In\nthat integration, airport security should be adaptive to emerging threats, flexible in responding to\nchanges in the security landscape, and scalable to expand or contract its posture as may be required.\nAnalysis\nRecommendations made by the Joint Public Safety Working Group, such as the ones highlighted in the\nparagraphs below, will provide some incremental threat mitigation value and should be considered.\nHowever, those same recommendations also point toward the need for LAWA to consider the overall\nmanagement of the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security program against industry best practices to ensure that program is\nreturning the greatest security and risk reduction return-on-investment possible. LAWA spends about\n$125 million on security annually. That does not include security related capital investments. Better\nintegration of security functions and the implementation of risk management practices will help assure\nthat every dollar spent is providing the best value possible for the security of the traveling public.\nAdoption of Community Policing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Public Safety Working Group appropriately recommends\nimplementation of community policing as a way to engage more effectively the airport residents they\nprotect. In recent weeks, LAWAPD initiated a community policing strategy to fill this potential gap in\nits overall security program. LAWAPD understands that civilian engagement and security awareness\nmust integrate with and strengthen police patrol and other threat mitigation efforts. Enlisting airport\ntenants as an active part of the LAWA security team is essential to holistic security, as is working in\npartnership with LAPD in the extension of civilian engagement to the environs surrounding the airport.\nReview of RAM Tactics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Directed show-of-force and high profile patrol details can randomly alter the\nface of police presence and are good best practices. However, the value of randomization can be\nlimited if other elements of security operations across the airport, to include those of airport tenants,\nare not similarly randomized and coordinated (i.e., random rotation of guards assigned to fixed\nsecurity posts, covering down on gaps in RAM patrol deployment, etc.). It is suggested that LAWAPD\nperform its own Red-Team assessment of RAM tactics before any changes are undertaken.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 1.1: Evolve the LAX security program to reflect a more integrated assessment of\nsecurity risk and provide for the ongoing development and management of mitigation measures.\nSecurity at LAX is governed by 49 CFR 1542 - Airport Security, which requires the maintenance of a\nTSA approved security program. These regulations are regularly updated to reflect changing threat\nconditions and are standards that must be met. However, Federal regulations do not assume to\naddress all threats and hazards faced by a particular facility, or suggest all security measures essential\nfor prudent and cost-effective mitigation of those risks. Since the basic requirements of 49 CFR 1542\nwere formulated, there has been a continuous evolution in airport security practices and technology\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 17\nand those lessons can be applied in the ongoing evolution of the LAX security plan and the\ndevelopment of any new risk-based security initiatives, as conditions warrant.\nRecommendation 1.2: Based on the risk assessment and updated security plan, consider the focus\nand structure of security functions to determine whether realignment and integration are needed.\nThere is no single locus of control for non-law enforcement aspects of LAX security, short of the Chief\nof Police, and some key roles are divided among several LAWAPD units. The mission of the Homeland\nSecurity and Intelligence Section within the Office of Homeland Security emphasizes compliance with\naviation security mandates (as opposed to risk management) and includes separate Vulnerability\nAssessment & Analysis and Critical Infrastructure Protection units. Security Officers reside in the\nTraffic and Security Section of the Office of Operations while the Video Observation Officer position is\nin the Field Support Section of the Office of Support Services. Realignment of key functions may offer\nenhanced capability to better manage security risks across a highly complex and dynamic facility.\nRecommendation 1.3: With the benefit of recent vulnerability and risk assessments, take a risk-\nbased approach to evaluating current security programs and explore intelligent use of technology.\nAs LAWA explores new options to enhance airport security, it must evaluate existing practices and\npersonnel deployments at the same time to determine their effectiveness and relevancy. Simply\nlayering new security practices into old ones may not only be less than cost-effective, it may also be\ncounterproductive. Security should be comprehensive, integrated, and holistic. A dollar wasted on\nless then effective security strategies means that another need may go unmet. LAWA should also\nassess its use of security technologies and determine whether it is getting maximum value from the\nsystems in which it has already invested. One example is in the use of advanced video analytics and\nvideo target tracking and indexing technologies to maximize the value of installed CCTV systems.\nObservation 2: Response to Armed Threats\nResponse to armed threats at LAX must consider a range of scenarios and provide for training and\ntactical integration of public safety partners as well as readiness of the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civilian residents.\nSince the 1970s, there have been numerous reported cases of armed attacks at airports around the\nworld. Moreover, the series of active shooter incidents across the country over the past few years gives\nfurther witness to the fact that the threat may come not just from terrorists, but also from deranged\nindividuals whose intentions are even less clear and harder to detect. With great foresight, LAWAPD\nand its LAPD counterparts have been training for just such a potential.\nThe well-executed interdiction of the LAX attacker on November 1, 2013 is among the first successful\napplications of advanced active shooter tactics by a local police agency in the country. However, lessons\nlearned, to include challenges in public safety incident command, EMS integration, and public alerting\nduring the phases of the response that followed, provide ample reason to consider how things may have\nbeen different, especially if there had been multiple attackers and/or had the attack been more lethal.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 18 Observations and Recommendations\nBackground\nA 2013 study of active shooter incidents conducted by Texas State University reinforces the notion that\nthis threat may be on the rise and that its lethality may be escalating, with 21 events occurring in 2010\nalone. According to the study, nearly half of these events are over before police arrive. However, police\nwere required to use force to stop the killing in 30 percent of all cases studied. Of those cases where\nforce was used, the majority (71%) required use of deadly force. The study further notes that officers\nwere shot in 15 percent of events underway when they arrived. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That makes an active shooter call\namong the most dangerous in law enforcement.\u00e2\u20ac 1 Thus, the study highlights the need for coordinated\nresponse by police and other public safety partners. It also offers ideas for consideration in three areas:2\nPolice Preparedness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Police require training in the tactical skills necessary to deal with active shooter\nincidents; such training must span both indoor and outdoor environments. As active shooters may\nemploy a variety of weapons to include high-powered rifles, and engagements may occur both over\nlong distances and in proximity to innocent victims, officers must be equipped with or have quick\naccess to patrol rifles and possess the marksmanship skills to apply precision fire if needed. Given the\nlethality of the weapons officers may encounter, appropriate ballistic protection is also essential.\nMedical Assistance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The priority of first arriving officers to an active shooter event must be to stop\nthe violence by mitigating the threat. This may mean initially moving quickly past the injured with the\nexpectation that medical help will follow. Because the more critically injured may succumb before the\narea is secure, EMS personnel should be trained to enter the area under police protection and,\noutfitted with the necessary ballistic armor, provide life-saving help sufficient to permit evacuation.\nLikewise, police should be trained and equipped to perform basic trauma first aid to assist EMS efforts.\nTraining for Civilians \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Almost half of all active shooter events are over before police are on scene and\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153the five highest casualty events since 2000 happened despite police arriving on scene in about 3\nminutes.\u00e2\u20ac3 Thus, active shooter awareness training for civilians resident in a potential target venue\ncould be a key element in saving lives. Police must work with the people they serve to ensure that\nthose who may be at risk understand how to respond to an active shooter threat if one were to occur.\nThe terrorist attacks in Mumbai India in 2008 and the Westgate Mall in Nairobi Kenya in 2013 have\nshown the lethal potential of coordinated attacks by teams of individuals using conventional weapons or\nexplosives on relatively soft or lightly protected targets. Whether such attacks are likely in this country\nis uncertain. What does seem clear is that active shooter events are only one end of the violence\nspectrum and that there is a range of plausible threats scenarios that airports must also now consider.\nAfter reviewing 30 active shooter incidents and exercises, DHS has identified three areas needing\ncontinued emphasis: incident management, medical response, and public safety and security.4 Failure\nto address any of these may create cascading problems that affect other aspects of the response.\nIncident Management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Active shooter incidents are rapid and dynamic, making it essential that, as\nthe initial tactical response is simultaneously unfolding, incident command be quickly established to\nenable operational coordination and communications, joint planning, and site security and protection.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 19\nMedical Response \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Response protocols must consider the pressing medical needs of the wounded as\nbalanced against the operational risk. This makes quick establishment of unified incident command\nand well-executed EMS logistics key to getting emergency medical care to victims in a timely manner.\nPublic Safety and Security \u00e2\u20ac\u201c To limit exposure to the threat and divert potential victims and the public\nat-large away from the scene, immediate public alert notifications must be made to ensure that\npeople are aware of the nature and status of the threat and the actions being taken in response.\nIn a recent article in Homeland Security Affairs, researchers suggested that multifaceted attacks using\nconventional weapons and tactics require new more cooperative strategies beyond those of a single\npublic safety agency. They encourage a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole-community\u00e2\u20ac approach and challenge the public safety\ndisciplines to operate as members of an integrated team.5 The most significant example of this thinking\nis reflected in the program called the Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series (JCTAWS).\nSponsored by the National Counterterrorism Center, DHS, and the FBI, JCTAWS promotes whole-\ncommunity cooperation across levels of government and among the police, fire, EMS, and emergency\nmanagement disciplines, as well as the civilian private sector. The intent of JCTAWS is to promote\nwhole-community integration and to use exercises to learn from a jurisdiction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective response to a\nhypothetical attack similar to Mumbai or Nairobi. The LAPD sponsored such a JCTAWS exercise in 2012.\nAnalysis\nThe tactical response to the active shooter incident of November 1 was well-executed, and the LAX CTA\nswept and secured within hours. It reflected a remarkable effort by all involved. That said, the Public\nSafety Working Group review provided a unique lens through which to assess its implications relative to\nother potential threats that may be more complex and/or lethal. That analysis might be viewed in three\nparts: response operations; EMS integration; and public awareness.\nResponse Operations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c According the Public Safety review, the active shooter incident on November\n1 began at about 9:20 AM with LAWAPD officers arriving at the location of the initial shooting within\n90 seconds of the first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shots fired\u00e2\u20ac broadcast. Advancing quickly into Terminal 3, these officers\nengaged the gunman and by 9:25 AM had taken him into custody. This quick and effective action is\nattributed to both the skill and heroism of the officers involved and the Active Shooter and MACTAC\ntraining that was and continues to be provided to LAWAPD officers and their LAPD counterparts.\nAlthough an ICP was established at 9:32 AM by the first arriving LAWAPD supervisor, LAPD and LAFD\ninitially set up separate ICPs at different locations. The Public Safety Working Group review\ndetermined that all responding agencies did not join together in a Unified Command structure until 45\nminutes later (10:14 AM). Moreover, the first incident objectives meeting occurred at 11:00 AM,\nabout 1.5 hours after the incident began. The ICP structure did not ever fully mature and this, along\nwith a lack of radio interoperability, caused gaps in interagency coordination. These challenges were\nintensified by a lack of familiarity with terminology and airport layout among some LAPD and LAFD\nresponders. MACTAC training is essential to police readiness in response to active shooter events, but\nin itself is not enough. Intensive training in multi-agency incident command, interoperable\ncommunications, and the right individual equipment are also key.\nEMS Integration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Public Safety review found that LAFD did not initially integrate with the\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 20 Observations and Recommendations\nLAWAPD ICP due to security concerns about the ICP location, which was in close proximity to the\nscene of the initial shooting. This hampered the incident commander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to coordinate law\nenforcement and fire department activities related to victim extraction from the danger area. In\naccordance with standard operating procedure at the time, police officers brought those victims out\nof the danger area where they could be safety treated and transported by EMS.\nAlthough an LAFD initiative to develop a tactical EMS capability was in development, the program was\nnot yet in effect at the time of the active shooter incident. LAFD is now providing its personnel with\nTactical Emergency Medical Support (TEMS) training to address this need. The Public Safety review\nrecommended that police officers assigned to LAX also receive First Responder - Operational level\nTEMS training. LAFD and LAWAPD trainers have already begun the initial stages of establishing a\ntraining plan for airport officers. These training initiatives will provide the capability to form joint\npolice and LAFD EMS Rescue Task Forces that may be employed during a future active shooter event.\nPublic Awareness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Given the rapid and dynamic nature active shooter incidents, the first few minutes\ncan be the most critical. Seconds can save lives. Accordingly, the better aware and informed people\nare in advance about how to recognize and respond to an active shooter event, the more likely it will\nbe that they take the personal initiative necessary to not only protect themselves but also possibly\nenable the safety of others around them. The Public Safety review recognized the value of a community\npolicing-based public engagement model and recommended its implementation at LAX as a vehicle to\nadvance public awareness on a range of preparedness topics, to include active shooter response.\nDuring an actual active shooter incident, the faster information is conveyed to those in harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way,\nthe more time they will have to react and take protective action. Likewise, alerts must be broadcast\nto those outside the area so that they stay away and do not hamper the response. Although public\naddress systems exist in every terminal, these were not used. However, great effort was made to\ncommunicate to the public via the web, social media, and public news outlets.\nIn light of the observations made by the Public Safety Working Group and information developed\nelsewhere in this report, had the events of November 1 been larger, more complex, and/or more lethal,\nchallenges related to incident command, interoperability, EMS integration, and public awareness and\nalerting may have greatly hampered the public safety community\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to resolve it. Preparedness for\nrisks higher on the threat continuum requires an integrated and collaborative whole community approach.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 2.1: Conduct a mini-JCTAWS workshop that stresses multi-agency incident\ncommand and whole community integration to reveal gaps in capabilities needing improvement.\nAlthough the federal JCTAWS program is conducted on a regional or metropolitan scale, the basic\npurpose and approach holds for any jurisdiction or major target venue like an international airport.\nSimilar to JCTAWS, a mini-JCTAWS workshop at LAX would seek to promote whole community\nparticipation across city, State, regional, and federal entities and the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private sector tenants\nand stakeholders. Building off lessons learned from the November 1, 2013 active shooter incident,\nthe workshop would also explore gaps in the knowledge and capabilities needed to address and\nresolve a complex and multi-faceted armed attack on the airport.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 21\nRecommendation 2.2: A year after the recommended mini-JCTAWS workshop, conduct a full-scale\ntactical exercise to evaluate all aspects of response operations, EMS integration, and pubic alerting.\nAs part of the integrated LAWA review, each member of Public Safety Working Group (LAWAPD, LAPD,\nLAFD) has also individually identified improvement actions to address perceived gaps in organization,\ntraining, and equipment for an active shooter event to be addressed within their respective agencies.\nThat work, coupled with lessons learned from a workshop focused on a whole community response to a\ncomplex and multi-faceted attack, will help strengthen individual and joint preparedness efforts that can\nthen be tested and validated through a full-scale exercise. The process used should mirror the standard\ncycle for capability building, which includes: 1) planning or revising plans based on lessons learned;\n2) making changes in organization, training, and equipment; 3) exercising to validate and adjust the\nchanges made; and 4) repeating the cycle in a process of continuous evaluation and improvement.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 22 Observations and Recommendations\nIncident Command\nMajor airports are a complex and interdependent network of hundreds of individual operations. A\ndisruption in any one of those operations can have cascading effects across that network and the\ngreater air transportation system. Beyond the effects of weather and other natural hazards, airports are\nalso vulnerable to threats like terrorism and individual acts of violence, such as what occurred at LAX on\nNovember 1, 2013. Managing the consequences of a significant airport disruption, especially an armed\nattack, requires not only the coordinated activities of a host of uniformed public safety agencies, but the\ncooperation and integrated effort of the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civilian management, operations personnel, tenants,\nand even its transient public population.\nEffective response and recovery requires a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole-community\u00e2\u20ac approach. That approach must be\nreflected in the implementation of incident command. This section of the report largely concerns the\nexecution of incident command in responding to the active shooter event of November 1. Put simply, it\naddresses the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153how\u00e2\u20ac of the incident response process. The Response Operations section that follows\naddresses more specifically the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what\u00e2\u20ac of the response as it unfolded. In addition to considering the\nexecution of ICS, a number of related capabilities and processes are also outlined.\nIncident Command System\nWhen an emergency requires a response from a variety of organizations and functional disciplines, the\nuse of common management processes and systems are vital to effective coordination. The ICS is\ndesigned to enable effective and efficient command and control by integrating a combination of\npersonnel, facilities, equipment, and communication assets operating within a universal command\nstructure. Developed in the 1970s, ICS has since evolved as a standard, national best practice. Thus, it is\nwidely employed by first responders, civilian agencies, and private sector organizations across the\ncountry to manage multi-agency and multi-jurisdictional disaster response operations. In addition to ICS\nguidance provided by FEMA, the FAA has adopted these same principles for the development and\nimplemention of multi-hazard Airport Emergency Plans (AEPs).\nApplication of ICS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c In their management of the security threat and the resulting airport disruption, all\nof the agencies involved (uniformed and civilian) made a determined effort to employ ICS practices.\nUse of those practices, especially joint-agency \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unified command\u00e2\u20ac were key in achieving a successful\noutcome. The shooter was neutralized in a matter of minutes, the impacted terminal cleared and\nsecured in less than 2 hours, and the entire CTA was assured safe and the majority of airport\noperations resumed only 6 hours later. This could not have been achieved without the\nprofessionalism, operational skill, and intense spirit of cooperation that was evident on that day.\nLessons learned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The application of incident command on November 1 indicated the need for\nimprovements in: situational awareness; alert and notification; interoperable communications; the\nbuild-out of ICS structure; role definition between incident command facilities; information flow\nwithin the ICS structure; and resource management. Enhancements in these areas will strengthen the\ngeneral preparedness of LAWA and its regional public safety partners.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 23\nObservation 3: Airport Response Coordination Center\nThe ARCC must provide continuous situational awareness essential to developing a relevant common\noperational picture for the Department Operations Center and Incident Command Post.\nLAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Airport Response Coordination Center (ARCC) brings together in one place a range of airport\nactivities essential to the effective day-to-day management of ongoing operations. By fostering close and\ncontinuous exchange of information among Airport Operations, Facilities Management, LAWAPD, and the\nTSA, the ARCC provides an around-the-clock capability for maintaining general awareness of airport\nactivity and resolving routine issues requiring coordinated action. Physically adjacent to the DOC, the\nARCC also provides information and facilitates coordination in support of emergency response operations.\nDuring LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the incident on November 1, 2013, gaps in DOC/ARCC procedures and staffing\ninhibited it from reaching its full potential as an information and coordination clearinghouse.\nBackground\nThe organization and technological capability of the ARCC provides it with a unique perspective on\nairport-wide activity. ARCC personnel have access to information concerning airfield operations,\npassenger terminals, roadways and parking lots, and the general situation around the airport perimeter.\nIn addition, inclusion of the LAWAPD Airport Police Information and Intelligence Center (APIIC) provides\nthe ARCC Duty Manager with direct access to information concerning law enforcement activity, to the\nextent that activity is not law enforcement sensitive. The intended focus of the ARCC in an emergency\nresponse is to help integrate information from across operations, facilities, emergency management,\nand public safety in a way that supports decision-making. It is also intended to use its everyday\nconnections to various airport functions to enable cross-airport collaboration at the request of the DOC\nDirector. (The ARCC Duty Manager transitions to the DOC Director upon activation of the DOC.)\nImportance of a Common Operational Picture \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The ARCC has at its disposal an array of technology\nand other resources to assist in its mission. This includes, but is not limited to access to all LAWA\nclosed circuit television (CCTV) cameras; crisis management tracking and reporting software;\ngeographic system (GIS) mapping; fire safety systems; and an alerting and mass notification\napplication called Everbridge. Integration of much of this information is to occur through a program\nknown as Situator. Situator is designed to be the ARCC tool that melds incident related information in\nto a single common operational picture. The phrase common operational picture (COP) is taken from\nmilitary usage and represents the idea of a single identical depiction of incident-specific information\nthat can be accessed by multiple units. This literal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153picture\u00e2\u20ac supports shared situational awareness for\ncollaborative planning and coordinated operations. The result of having a common operational\npicture is that everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 knows the same thing, at the same time, and in the same way. More than\nanything, the primary product of the ARCC should be a relevant common operational picture.\nIncident Alert and Notification \u00e2\u20ac\u201c On the morning of November 1, the ARCC Duty Manager first\nlearned of the incident when he heard the initial reports of a shooting in Terminal 3 broadcast over\nthe LAWAPD radio channel he happened to be monitoring. He confirmed the incident with APIIC staff\nin the ARCC who were already conducting an initial round of law enforcement notifications through\nthe Everbridge system. He then contacted Airport Operations management personnel to initiate their\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 24 Observations and Recommendations\nresponse and broadcast a radio warning over the OPSMAIN channel to alert other operations\npersonnel in the vicinity of the incident to exercise caution. Through the monitoring of cameras, ARCC\nstaff began to see passengers self-evacuating onto the airfield from Terminal 3 and initiated actions to\nclose the neighboring taxiway and marshal airfield buses to contain and transport the passengers\naway from the scene. The ARCC Duty Manager continued to personally make notifications in\naccordance with standard procedure and then directed immediate activation of the LAWA DOC.\nLAWA DOC Activation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c On activating the DOC, the ARCC Duty Manager assumed the role of DOC\nDirector, appointed a replacement ARCC Duty Manager, and went about organizing the staffing of\npositions in the DOC. This was done first by stripping a portion of the ARCC shift already in place and\nthen by filling in with supplemental LAWA personnel as they arrived. As a part of this transition to\nDOC activation, ARCC personnel were required to physically leave their workstations in the ARCC and\nmove across the floor and into a separate room to activate their DOC workstations. The DOC room is\nnot staffed and its systems and workstations are normally maintained in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold\u00e2\u20ac state until activated.\nThis left certain ARCC roles uncovered during the critical early stages of the incident.\nThroughout the remainder of the incident, the ARCC worked in support of the DOC in an attempt to\nreinforce information exchange and assist the DOC in its coordination of non-public safety aspects of the\nresponse not being addressed by the ICP. By most accounts, the DOC/ARCC played minimal role in\nsupport of the ICP, and the ARCC never produced a common operational picture.\nAnalysis\nSince normal ARCC functioning was interrupted in the transition to DOC activation, there was some loss\nof situational awareness and continuity of ARCC operations during the critical early moments of a rapidly\ndeveloping emergency situation. The ARCC Duty Manager, as senior Airport Operations representative\nin the facility had to pull away from the ARCC to get the DOC in a ready state and plug ARCC staff into\nkey DOC roles, all while personally attempting to make key notifications of LAWA senior leaders. As this\nprocess unfolded, communications activity in the ARCC and DOC began to increase in tempo. During the\nconfusion of that activity, a key ARCC role \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the release of a second round of alert notifications via the\nEverbridge system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was not initiated until much later.\nARCC and DOC Operational Models \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The current cooperative model of the ARCC certainly provides\ngreat benefits to LAX in handling of routine incidents. In that day-to-day model, the ARCC Duty\nManager essentially performs as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broker,\u00e2\u20ac facilitating the sharing of information and enabling\nvoluntary collaborative efforts across the LAWA organization. Personnel in the ARCC act as liaisons\nfrom their various organizational units and disciplines making connections and providing value where\nthey can. This is unlike the functioning of an incident command facility such as the DOC where\nmembers step out of their functional roles and perform as an integrated team. That team works\ntogether to achieve a common set of objectives in direct support of response activities and under the\norchestration of an operations center \u00e2\u20ac\u0153director.\u00e2\u20ac On activation, the ARCC is an extension of the DOC,\nand as such should support incident management processes while also handling more routine tasks.\nProcedures, Staffing and Training \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lacking sufficient training and experience, the DOC Director and\nthe ARCC staff assigned to the DOC reverted to what they knew best. They performed their DOC roles\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 25\nmuch in the same fashion they normally do in the ARCC. They brokered information sharing and\ncollaboration but did not do any planning or otherwise help manage the totality of the response effort\nas an important adjunct to activity in the ICP. This would include producing a common operational\npicture. Moreover, there is no definition of what a COP is at LAWA; no procedure for creating and\nmaintaining one; and no means to get that picture to the ICP on a regular basis for use in coordinating\nthe response and synchronizing the activities of the ICP and DOC.\nThe paradox of building and sharing situational awareness is that the DOC/ARCC has to get information\nif it is going to refine it and give it back. The DOC/ARCC will only get that information if those units that\nmust give it (the ICP and others) feel that what they get in return is value added. The ICP did not\ncontinually inform the DOC/ARCC nor did the ICP request DOC/ARCC help in painting a common\noperational picture of the broader emergency. The ICP simply did not see the DOC/ARCC as relevant\nand/or did not understand or appreciate its intended purpose or capability. The ARCC as an arm of the\nDOC has great potential value in better informing the response to any emergency. Despite its\ntechnology, that value was not fully realized on November 1 due to lack of procedures and training.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 3.1: Create and codify procedures for the ARCC that support the production of a\ndaily common operational picture and associated briefings necessary during incident response.\nAn old military saying is\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You will fight as you train.\u00e2\u20ac The ARCC works well for its intended day-to-\nday purpose, but this model is not wholly supportive of its functioning in a high-pressure, time-\ncompressed environment such as an operations center in the midst of a crisis. The rhythm and daily\nprocesses of the ARCC simply must mirror those that will be employed on DOC activation so that the\ntransition is as seamless as possible. The ARCC staff must also work together as a team and practice\nthe kind of information gathering, status monitoring, situation reporting, and operational briefings\nthat it would support subsequent to activation of the DOC in a real emergency. In doing so, it will\nhone these skills and be much better prepared to create a common operational picture at the outset\nof an emergency. LAWAPD and airport operations should work together to define the common\noperational picture requirements and dissemination processes for use within the DOC and the ICP.\nRecommendation 3.2: Define requirements and process for maintaining continual situational\nawareness across all airport functions and the systems necessary to facilitate information exchange.\nThe ARCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to create a common operational picture in the heat of a crisis will be largely\ndependent on its ability to maintain continual situational awareness across not only the general\noperations of the airport, but also all aspects of an ongoing emergency response. To do this,\ninformation requirements from various LAWA activities will need to be better defined and the\nprocesses for situation reporting and continual exchange between the ICP and the DOC/ARCC will need\nto be stipulated and reinforced in training and exercises. The posture in the DOC/ARCC must become\none of being energetically proactive in organizing and pushing out situational awareness information,\nrather than being reactive and waiting for requests from the incident command team. Synchronizing\nthe operational rhythm (e.g., schedule for reporting, briefings, and shift changes) will be vital to\nensuring that the exchange between the ICP and DOC/ARCC is productive and mutually supporting.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 26 Observations and Recommendations\nRecommendation 3.3: Align ARCC organization, staffing, and technology as needed to perform as\nthe de facto first level of DOC activation and the core of the DOC planning section thereafter.\nBecause there is tremendous interdependency between the missions of the ARCC and DOC, leaving\nthem as structured (as two separate operating theaters) creates artificial barriers to communication,\ncoordination, and support. The ARCC and DOC should be combined as a DOC that operates at a first-\nlevel of activation on a day-to-day basis. When the DOC is moved to the next level of activation (the\nstaffing of incident command positions), the ARCC should work in support of the DOC Planning\nSection. Day-to-day functions should not be stripped to fill incident command positions but instead\nshould continue to function and build the common operational picture, handle communications, and\nsupport rapid assessment and mobilization. A DOC custodian should turn-on DOC systems kept in a\nready \u00e2\u20ac\u0153warm\u00e2\u20ac state and prepare those for the arrival of qualified incident command leadership.\nObservation 4: Alert and Response Mobilization\nThe right systems, clear lines of responsibility, and well documented processes for alert notification\nare critical to avoiding delay in mobilizing a response during the early stages of any emergency.\nTimely and accurate communication throughout the lifecycle of an event is essential to enabling a more\neffective overall response. The ongoing cycle of alert, notification, and response begins with the very\nfirst report of an emergency. The means for that initial alert must be available, reliable, and support the\nrapid communication of the essential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who, what, why, where, and when\u00e2\u20ac of the situation. With as\nmuch information as can be obtained, public safety officials can then immediately dispatch help to the\nscene and notify others who need to support the response or otherwise have a need to know. Ongoing\nnotification of response personnel must likewise provide for timely and accurate situational awareness.\nBackground\nAt the onset of the active shooter event of November 1, 2013, the initial public alert to LAWAPD was\nimmediate and the response by LAWAPD Communications and police officers was swift and effective.\nThere was no delay in getting the right help to the scene and the situation was resolved within minutes.\nHowever, the incident surfaced some issues that could be problematic in another emergency if not\ncorrected. These include duress phones (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Red Phones\u00e2\u20ac) at TSA screening stations; the method of\nrouting of 911 calls to LAWAPD; capacity to handle high call volume in the LAWAPD Communications\nUnit; and the processes and division of responsibility for LAWA staff and stakeholder notifications.\nLAWAPD Communications and the APIIC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The LAWAPD Communications Unit handles incoming\nemergency calls and dispatching of public safety personnel to emergencies at LAX. The unit monitors\nthe status of these incidents, helps coordinate the deployment of police units, makes emergency\nnotifications, and provides status updates to key LAWA personnel and other law enforcement\npartners. Another point of alert and notification is the LAWAPD APIIC located in the ARCC.\nThe APIIC performs the following functions: provides information on the status of airport operations\nto the LAWAPD Communications Unit and operational supervisors; monitors LAWAPD and airport\noperations radio traffic for situational awareness; shares non-sensitive information on the status of\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 27\npolice operations with the ARCC Duty Manager and staff; ensures liaison with the TSA representative\nto the ARCC; and, as of November 1, was responsible for making an initial round of Everbridge\nnotifications. The protocol at the time was for the APICC to make the first set of Everbridge\nnotifications to public safety stakeholders and then the ARCC would send a second set to an expanded\nlist of airport staff and associated partners. Everbridge is an alert and mass notification system that\nspeeds the emergency notification process.\nAlert Capabilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Alerts to emergency situations and calls for assistance can be received by LAWAPD\nin a number of ways. These include radio calls from officers in the field; notices from the ARCC via the\nAPICC; 911 calls received by other police agencies and routed to LAWAPD; and direct calls made to\nLAWAPD via its own unique emergency call number \u00e2\u20ac\u201c (310) 646-7911. It can also receive direct calls\nfrom LAX in-house airport phones by callers dialing 6-7911. LAWAPD is not a Public Safety Answering\nPoint (PSAP) for the handling of general 911 calls made over the commercial network.\nWhen 911 calls are made from non-LAWA phones at LAX, they go directly to LAPD and are routed back\nto LAWAPD. When 911 calls are made from mobile phones on the airport or in the vicinity, they are\nanswered by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) and are likewise routed to LAWAPD. In addition to\nthese general methods of alerting LAWAPD of an emergency, there are Red Phones located at each\nTSA passenger checkpoint to permit immediate and direct communications with Airport Police. TSA\ncan also reach LAWAPD via the posted emergency number or via the TSA representative in the ARCC\nwho in turn would relay that information to the LAWAPD Communications Unit via the APIIC.\nInitial Alerts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c On November 1, the first indication of an emergency came at 09:19 AM, immediately\nafter the first shots were fired. This alert came via a call from the Red Phone located at the Terminal 3\nTSA passenger checkpoint. An unidentified TSA agent apparently picked up the Red Phone but\nimmediately dropped it in the hasty evacuation from the checkpoint. The LAWAPD operator only\nheard the sounds of shouting and gunshots. With no caller identification for a call from a Red Phone,\nand no one on the other end of the line, it was not initially known from where the call originated.\nThe next alert came immediately following at 09:20 AM from an airport employee who made the call\nto LAWAPD from his personal mobile phone and advised that a shooting had just occurred at Terminal\n3. LAWAPD dispatcher immediately broadcast a notification of shots fired on the primary LAWAPD\nradio channel and thus initiated the police response. A steady stream of telephone calls and radio\ncommunications into the LAWAPD Communications Unit followed, nearly overwhelming the\noperators. These included direct calls from people in the vicinity of the shooting and continuous calls\nfrom LAPD and the CHP communications centers relaying calls they received from their 911 systems.\nEmergency Notifications \u00e2\u20ac\u201c As the LAWAPD Communications unit was handling the deluge of calls and\ncoordinating the LAWAPD response at Terminal 3, it was also simultaneously making emergency\nnotifications to numerous internal and external stakeholders by radio, phone, text messaging, and E-\nmail according to pre-identified lists. The LAWAPD APIIC was making other notifications using the\nEverbridge mass notification system from the ARCC. ARCC airport operations personnel made still\nmore notifications, again using the Everbridge system, and via phone calls made personally by the\nDOC Director in accordance with standard protocol. All of this was in addition to external notifications\nto other stakeholders made by the LAWA Media and Public Relations Division via E-mail and phone.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 28 Observations and Recommendations\nAnalysis\nLAWAPD candidly acknowledges that many airport residents and most travelers and visitors who transit\nthe facility do not know how to contact Airport Police in an emergency. The LAWAPD phone number \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\n(310) 646-7911 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not well known, well posted, or user friendly. Unless a caller knows and has access\nto an in-house airport phone, emergency 911 calls go directly to either the LAPD or CHP and must be\nrelayed to LAWAPD. This can cause delay and introduce the opportunity for error. The Public Safety\nWorking Group discovered technical malfunctions in the emergency alert systems at the Terminal 3 TSA\npassenger checkpoint. Moreover, the working group reports that an airport-wide audit of Red Phone\nand panic alarms found that some of these devices were also not working properly.\nOn notification of the incident, the APIIC, which resides within the ARCC, was requested to issue\nimmediate Everbridge notifications to key stakeholders. At 9:25 AM, the APIIC sent a message to the\nLaw Enforcement Notification Group only. That list of notifications was limited to a select set of\npersonnel from airport operations, airport police, and LAX executive management. At 10:15 AM, it was\nbrought to the attention of the LAWA DOC Director that Everbridge notifications were not being sent to\nall key stakeholders. Though the DOC Director took corrective action, in the heat of DOC activity, those\nadditional notifications did not go out until 10:54 AM, almost an hour and thirty minutes after the initial\nshooting took place. Since November 1, LAWA learned that a number of the Everbridge notifications\neither went to the wrong recipients or did not connect with their intended targets as the lists needed to\nbe updated. Those updates have since been completed by LAWA.\nIn addition to the tremendously high call volume into the LAWAPD Communications Unit that would\nnormally be expected from such an incident, problems with mass notification meant that some\nstakeholder organizations reached out to LAWAPD directly for information on the emergency. Added to\nthis were the insatiable and persistent inquiries of the media for information, which further served to\nhamper the unit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to devote time and attention to more pressing operational communications.\nThese same issues spilled over into the ARCC, which also found itself expending considerable energy on\nhandling the high volume of requests for information and guidance coming from a variety of sources.\nIn every emergency there is an ongoing cycle of alert, notification, and response that repeats itself as\nthe situation unfolds. The more timely, actionable, and targeted the information, the more rapid and\nsuccessful the response. The interdiction of the shooter on November 1 was quick and successful\nbecause a sharp airport employee knew who to call and what to say, and the LAWAPD dispatcher could\ncalmly inform and guide the responding officers to where they were needed to prevent further tragedy.\nSpeed is life. LAWA alert and notification systems and protocols must be designed to be available,\nreliable, and support the rapid communication of essential information. Improvements are needed in\nhandling 911 calls; the reliability and automatic identification of Red Phones; management of stakeholder\nnotifications; and LAWAPD Communications Unit and ARCC capability to manage call volume.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 29\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 4.1: Explore and make needed enhancements to emergency alerting methods,\ntechnologies, and protocols to include 911 call handling and a more reliable Red Phone system.\nThe current fragmentation of systems and communications channels for initial public alert need to be\nbetter integrated to ensure that the LAWAPD Communications Unit can handle every call as it did on\nNovember 1. The regional 911 system serving the airport needs to be rationalized and a study\nconducted on the feasibility of establishing the LAWAPD Communications Unit as a secondary Public\nSafety Answering Point (PSAP) to handle 911 calls. A modification in the routing of 911 calls made\nfrom mobile phones on and in the vicinity of the airport should also be considered. Red Phone\nreliability and functionality improvements should be implemented to include the incorporation of\ncaller identification technology. A comprehensive awareness program should be developed to ensure\nthat LAX tenants, employees, and the traveling public are aware of how to contact LAWAPD and the\nessential information required in an emergency.\nRecommendation 4.2: Ensure singular responsibility for administrating notification processes and\nsystems as an integrated program and perform audits, tests, and updates on a regular basis.\nOn November 1, at least four separate LAWA units made emergency notifications to large audiences\nof stakeholders through a wide variety of technologies and from an even larger array of contact lists;\nsome of these were of questionable accuracy. There was considerable duplication of effort, no central\nmonitoring or accountability for what messages were sent, to whom they were sent, and whether\nthey actually reached their intended audiences. Though it may be necessary that notifications to\ndifferent audiences be handled by different units, related methodologies, messages, and technologies\nshould be harmonized under a single integrated program and monitored centrally for quality control.\nThe DOC/ARCC should serve as that single point of control for ensuring an effective notification effort.\nRecommendation 4.2: Address core staffing and augmentation support needed in the LAWAPD\nCommunications Unit and in the communications and call handling functions of the DOC/ARCC.\nThe LAWAPD Communications Unit and the DOC/ARCC are staffed to support steady state operations\nand not the tremendous call volume experienced on November 1, 2013. After filling any current\nvacancies in the LAWAPD Communications Unit, LAWA should conduct an analysis of call traffic\nhandled on that day and consider strategies for flexible scaling of call-handling capability in an\nemergency. Those strategies might include: additional communications positions kept in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153warm\u00e2\u20ac\nready state; an on-call cadre of employees trained to handle dispatch functions; rolling-over calls to\nother emergency communications centers; and/or a call center contract that can be activated in an\nemergency. Staffing of the DOC/ARCC communications suite should likewise be evaluated. Of fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 30 Observations and Recommendations\nObservation 5: Interoperable Communications\nUnity of command and effective coordination of interdependent response operations rely greatly on a\nwell-integrated and rehearsed communications plan and having interoperable equipment.\nIncompatibility of radio systems is one of the most common problems facing first responder agencies.\nThe ability of police, fire, EMS, and emergency management units to communicate with whom they\nneed to, when they need to, and as authorized is essential to sharing information, coordinating\noperations, and ultimately saving lives in a crisis. The multi-agency response to the November 1, 2013\nactive shooter incident involved many local, state, and federal agencies, LAWA civilian operations, and\nprivate sector partners. Communications among all of these entities proved a daunting challenge.\nThe communications challenge was especially acute among the large number of police agencies that\ndeployed in support of LAWAPD. Many of these agencies took a direct part in the massive effort to\nprovide perimeter protection and help clear and secure the LAX CTA of any remaining threats to the\nairport population. This effort required coordinated operations over a wide area and a readiness to\nrespond together if any new threat emerged. The lack of interoperable radio communication between\nLAWAPD and LAPD and its regional partners made it difficult for the ICP to track what was cleared and\nwhat remained, and to redirect assets as needed.\nBackground\nIn 2011, and in advance of many regional public safety partners, LAWAPD upgraded its communications\nplatform to a trunk radio system compliant with the DHS SAFECOM and Project 25 (P25) inter-operable\ndigital two-way wireless communications standards as endorsed by the Los Angeles Regional\nInteroperable Communications System (LA-RICS). The trunk-radio system allows for pooling of the\ncurrent frequencies owned by LAWA instead of dedicating a single frequency to a single channel. The\nadvantage of this system is that it allows numerous users to create Talk Groups to conduct their\nbusiness without having to set aside separate frequencies for each user, thereby maximizing capacity.\nThe cost of that investment was about $5.4 million. The new system, though compatible with national\nand regional standards, meant that LAWA would have improved internal radio communications, but not\nbe interoperable with many of its public safety partners, until they too upgraded to those standards.\nOn the day of the LAX shooting, more than 20 different agencies responded to the airport in various\ncapacities with very little in the way of interoperable communications. Of special note is that when\nsenior LAPD and LAFD commanders arrived on scene, lacking communications interoperability with\nLAWAPD, each was unaware of what the others were doing and where exactly the LAWAPD ICP had\nbeen established. Initially, communications with other agencies had to be relayed through each\norganization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own communications center. This was, at least in part, why achieving Unified Command\nand unity of effort at Terminal 3 was somewhat delayed. Members of the ICP supplemented radio\ncommunications with the use of cell phones because they were more effective, though that method\nwould not necessarily have been reliable in a larger regional emergency.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 31\nAnalysis\nThe LAPD, Los Angeles Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department, and the police departments of the South Bay cities\ncontinue to operate on conventional radio systems. As a result, their communications with LAWAPD are\nlimited to a single \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Access Channel.\u00e2\u20ac This frequency is patched with a LAWAPD trunk talk group for\ninteroperability. Unfortunately, a single point of communication across all of those agencies is not\nsufficient to manage a large-scale multi-agency event, such as the one on November 1. During that\nresponse, multiple channels/talk groups were needed and communications could have been divided\nbased on joint activities and not just agency. Examples of such activities include traffic control, crowd\nmanagement, perimeter security, and special operations. Being the only agency in the area on a trunk\nsystem, LAWAPD is unable to maximize the full capability of its radio technology and integrate with and\nenable coordination among the regional agencies that may support responses to future incidents at LAX.\nLacking interoperability means that LAWAPD units are also limited in their ability to maintain situational\nawareness concerning activity within surrounding jurisdictions that may have implications for LAX safety\nand security or require interagency mutual aid. LAX borders the cities of El Segundo and Inglewood and\nis within the city limits of Los Angeles. Each of these agencies operates on a separate conventional radio\nsystem. If these systems were interoperable, LAWAPD radios could be programed to monitor the\nactivities of the neighboring cities and be aware of calls for service. All LAWAPD radios are programmed\nwith LAPD Pacific Base frequencies and can easily be accessed by LAWAPD officers. However, LAWAPD\nleadership has expressed concerns about having to switch frequencies in a fast moving event, where it\nmight be safer for a supporting agency not so heavily engaged to switch to an LAWAPD frequency.\nLAFD operates on an 800 MHz frequency, which is not compatible with the LAWAPD radio system.\nHowever, LAFD vehicles operating at LAX are equipped with UHF radios that can be programmed with\nLAWAPD frequencies. Currently, LAWAPD has provided a single hand-held radio to each of the LAFD\nBattalion 4 vehicles serving LAX to allow them access to the LAWAPD trunk radio system. In addition,\nLAWAPD and LAFD are in discussion to program LAFD UHF mobile radios with LAWAPD trunk talk groups.\nThere is currently no easy solution to the interoperability dilemma faced by LAWAPD. LAWA has made a\nsignificant investment in a radio system that meets current interoperability standards while other\nregional agencies have not made similar upgrades. The LA-RICS program, after years of delay, is\nrecently gaining momentum but the full build-out of that system is still years away. LAWAPD should\ncontinue to engage in the LA-RICS initiative, but short-term improvement may only come from a less-\nthan-optimal set of fixes until more universal regional interoperability is achieved.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 5.1: Expand efforts to work with LAPD, LAFD, and other public safety partners\nthrough the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communication System (LA-RICS) initiative.\nIn 2009, public agencies in the Los Angeles area entered into a Joint Powers Agreement to establish the\nLA-RICS. This agreement allowed members to establish a wide-area interoperable public safety\ncommunications network and provide for common standards for continually evolving interoperable\ncommunications platforms used by more than 80 police and fire agencies in the area. As a collection of\nagencies similarly grappling with the challenge of interoperability, LAWAPD can benefit from this\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 32 Observations and Recommendations\nassociation as it negotiates and develops agreements to strengthen interoperability of its communications\nnetwork with those of their closest mutual aid partners. As a priority, LAWAPD should explore long and\nshort-term technology options to ensure more complete interoperability with LAPD and LAFD.\nRecommendation 5.2: Pursue acquisition of a communications van to serve as an interoperability hub\nin support of incident command post operations and procure a cache of additional LAWAPD radios.\nWhile LAWA has invested deeply in new communications technology, interim solutions must be found\nand implemented if the current interoperability gap is to be bridged between LAWAPD and its closest\nmutual aid partners. Increased flexibility in interagency communications can be achieved by acquiring a\ncache of LAWAPD radios to deploy with the supervisors of mutual aid partners responding to a major LAX\nemergency. While this will not solve the interoperability problem, it could go a long way to making\ncommand and control in a crisis like November 1 somewhat more manageable. LAWAPD should also\nconsider the purchase of a communications van equipped with radio technology compatible with its\nlocal, state, and federal partners. That van would serve as a communications hub at an ICP and provide a\nback-up alternative to the LAWAPD dispatch center, should that center ever be disabled.\nRecommendation 5.3: Develop a comprehensive communication plan annex to the LAX Airport\nEmergency Plan (AEP) that incorporates local law enforcement, fire, and federal agency partners.\nAs part of LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing AEP annex development, a Communications Annex is already programmed for\ndrafting. That annex must align with and support not only the multi-agency incident command framework\noutlined in the base AEP, but also the more tailored implementation of the AEP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scenario-based\noperational annexes that may have their own unique communications requirements. The plan will\nnotionally describe the allocation of communications equipment and spectrum by unit, function,\nchannel/talk group, as well as alternative communications means should the primary assignments be\nsomehow compromised or not available. All communications modes, not just radio, should be considered\n(e.g., satellite phones, voice-over-IP, etc.). The practice of developing incident specific communications\nplans as a part of the IAP process should also be reinforced during on-going training and exercises.\nCommunications exercises with LAWAPD mutual aid partners, especially LAPD, are strongly encouraged.\nObservation 6: Evolution of Incident Command\nDisciplined build-out of the incident command structure and deliberate integration of all response\npartners is key to achieving unity of command and leveraging the full capability of all available assets.\nThe response to and recovery from a no-notice incident requires rapidly developing an emergency\nresponse organization that integrates the efforts of numerous agencies and jurisdictions, each with\ndifferent roles, responsibilities, and capabilities. That organization begins with the first arriving public\nsafety official and establishing an ICP. It then continues on through response to recovery and the\nultimate return to normal operations. Development of that organization evolves over time and must\nbuild the capacity to manage the totality of the event. It must include not just the ICP and first\nresponders at the scene, but also the operations centers and leadership structure that are vital to\nmanaging a collective multi-agency response and recovery effort.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 33\nIn addressing the active shooter incident on November 1, 2013, the participating public safety agencies\neach made a determined effort to implement incident command practices in the management of\nresponse operations. This was particularly true in the ultimate establishment of collaborative and\nunified joint-agency command and the manner in which resources from various agencies were blended\ntogether to form integrated teams to accomplish a variety of operational tasks. Although Unified\nCommand was achieved, it was initially slow to develop, the ICP did not evolve sufficient capacity to\naccomplish key incident management tasks, and it lacked adequate representation from civilian\noperations to help focus and address non-security issues. Even though it was ultimately successful due\nin large part to a terrific spirit of interagency support and cooperation, there is general consensus that,\nwith more robust evolution of incident command, recovery may have been accelerated.\nBackground\nResponse to a complex incident requires the coordinated efforts and resources of numerous\nindependent agencies, organizations, and jurisdictions. The Incident Command System, a pillar of the\nNIMS, provides a standardized incident management approach to unify all response activities within a\ncommon organizational structure that is designed to achieve unity of effort and a shared set of incident\nobjectives. ICS is predicated on nine principles that guide its application: unity of command; modular\norganization; manageable span of control; consolidated incident planning; management by objectives;\nintegrated communications; common terminology; comprehensive resource management; and\ndesignated incident facilities (e.g., ICP, staging areas, etc.).\nICS structure is meant to be scalable and flexible. It can be expanded and contracted as needed\ndepending on the nature, scope, and complexity of the situation. The principles of unity, modularity,\nand span of control are reflected in the five major sections of ICS structure, which include Command,\nPlanning, Operations, Logistics, and Finance and Administration. Although in the early stages of an\nemergency these functions are typically dominated by public safety leaders, ICS encourages integration\nof key civilian capabilities and interests as essential to managing the totality of the crisis. The\nintegration of all relevant stakeholders is in keeping with what is called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole-community\u00e2\u20ac approach.\nEmergency response and recovery, especially at an airport, demand such an approach. Civilian\nemergency management and airport operations counterparts need to be fully embedded in the incident\ncommand structure at the outset. If not, the failure to adequately address non-public safety issues and\nincident objectives (e.g., mass care, disaster recovery, etc.) could compromise the entire operation.\nDuring the initial response to the November 1 incident, responding agencies immediately began to\nimplement ICS and took steps to develop Unified Command. As the active shooter incident began to\nunfold and tactical teams entered Terminal 3, the LAWAPD Watch Commander obtained the LAWAPD\ncommand vehicle and established an ICP outside the terminal. The ICP initially had representation from\nLAWAPD, LAPD Field Services Branch, and Airport Operations. LAPD resources arriving from offsite\nestablished their own ICP, but identified the duplication of effort and relocated to the LAWAPD ICP by\n10:05 AM. Similarly, LAFD initially established a separate Fire Command and Staging Area on the upper\nlevel on the east end of Terminal 2. The LAFD Incident Commander eventually relocated to LAWAPD\nICP. At that point, UC was established with representation from the lead response agencies. The\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 34 Observations and Recommendations\nUnified Command held its first incident objectives meeting at 11:00 AM and efforts were made to\norganize responding assets into a single ICS structure for the incident.\nAnalysis\nEven though all responding agencies made a strong commitment to implement ICS and a Unified\nCommand approach to managing the incident, there were several areas in which more disciplined\napplication of incident command doctrine and processes would have benefitted overall efforts at\nresponse and recovery. These issues relate to the ICS principles described above and include: 1)\ndifferences in perspective around the scope and focus of the incident command team (unity of effort);\n2) the structure and capability needed to support incident management (scalable organization); and 3)\nhow efforts to achieve objectives would be synchronized (incident action planning).\nUnity of Effort \u00e2\u20ac\u201cThe agencies involved were committed to collaborative decision-making within the\nUnified Command and Airport Operations was included in all decision-making; however, the intense\nfocus of public safety leadership on the tactical situation tended to narrow their perspective to that\naspect of the emergency alone. Such emergencies can place responders under unimaginable stress,\noften causing them to mentally narrow their focus on doing what they know and migrating toward\nwho they know best.6 No matter how well meaning the intent toward collaboration, this narrowing\nactually works against real collaboration and reinforces an organizational bias that can limit how\nleaders view the scope of the problem and who should be involved to solve it. In this case, the Unified\nCommand saw its role as addressing the shooting and not the larger airport emergency.\nOn November 1, there were two emergencies, one a result of the other. There was the active shooter\nevent to include residual security concerns and then there was the larger airport-wide disruption. The\nfirst of course was of greater priority, but they were interdependent. While airport recovery was high\non the minds of the senior leaders in the Unified Command, and it was discussed in the development\nof incident objectives, this priority did not carry forward into either the build-out of the incident\ncommand organization or in deliberate incident action planning. This impacted things like delay in\ngetting mission-essential civilian personnel into the airport to enable recovery, lack of awareness at\nthe ICP about mounting mass care needs, and less than seamless transition between airport-wide\nsecurity operations and terminal restoration efforts. In addition to simple differences in\norganizational perspective, Unified Command\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of awareness and thus attention to non-security\npriorities was further compounded by the lack of strong and sufficient representation in the ICP by\nAirport Operations to address these sorts of non-security issues.\nScalable Organization \u00e2\u20ac\u201c While Unified Command did assign Section Chiefs for three of the four top-\nline components within the ICS structure (Operations, Planning, and Logistics), only the Operations\nSection was further built out and organized into branches with the assignment of resources from the\nvarious public safety agencies. With a priority focus on security objectives, neither civilian airport\noperations nor facilities management was included in the structure of the Operations Branch. Their\nomission tended to hamper police - civilian coordination on mass care and recovery concerns and\nunnecessarily limited the Unified Command\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to civilian operational assets should those have\nbeen required.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 35\nIn large multi-agency operations, the Planning Section is essential to maintaining situational\nawareness, shepherding the incident planning process, drafting the Incident Action Plan (IAP), and\nforecasting the needs of future operational periods and phases of the response. Likewise, as the scale\nof an emergency response expands, so do the resources to support it. The Logistics Section provides\nresources, facilities, services, and material to meet the requirements of the ICS organization, as well as\ntechnical support for interoperable communications. Figure 4 provides two examples of how ICS can\nbe adjusted (expanded or contracted) to meet the needs of the response. It also shows the\nrelationship between functions to include the notional build-out of the Planning and Logistics sections.\nThe structure for an incident of the scale of November 1 would normally be closer to the smaller of\nthe two charts, with the exception of the further build-out of the branches under Operations and\nwhat should have been the inclusion of airport operations and facilities management resources.\nFigure 4: Examples of Differently Scaled ICS Organizational Structures\nAs the incident on November 1 expanded in scale and complexity, limited staffing and build-out of\nboth the Planning and Logistics Sections created challenges for Unified Command. Rather than fully\ndelegate tactical responsibility for law enforcement and EMS operations to the Operations Section\nChief, members of the UC directly engaged in controlling tactical employment of assigned resources.\nWith the Unified Command unable to fully organize ICP functioning, the Planning Section did not\nevolve and grow as conditions warranted. Thus the Planning Section did not develop full situational\nawareness of the larger emergency or advance a deliberate process of incident action planning in\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 36 Observations and Recommendations\nanticipation of emerging events on behalf of Unified Command. As a result, Unified Command\nassumed the planning role in addition to control of tactical operations. This limited its ability to step\nback and appreciate the extent of the larger emergency or address non-security issues.\nFocused on both planning and controlling tactical operations, and lacking the advantage of the fuller\nsituational awareness that the Planning Section should have provided, Unified Command had neither\nthe time nor perspective to better engage on the non-security aspects of the emergency. Moreover,\nless than full build-out of the Planning Section meant that key tools and artifacts of incident\nmanagement (e.g., maps, status boards, inventory of resources, etc.) were not available to the Unified\nCommand making the job of command and control in such a situation all that more difficult.\nPersonnel filling key incident command roles were simply not sufficient in number or prepared with\nthe training, equipment, or technology needed to support an incident of this magnitude.\nIncident Action Planning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A consolidated planning effort is vital to establishing incident objectives,\ndefining the resources and organization needed to achieve those objectives, and guiding coordinated\nemployment of those resources to accomplish operational tasks. This work is largely accomplished\nthrough the Incident Action Planning process, also known as the Planning \u00e2\u20ac\u0153P.\u00e2\u20ac\nAs shown in Figure 5, planning activities begin at the initial\nresponse and provide an iterative framework where\nUnified Command assesses incident requirements,\ndevelops clear and concise incident objectives, and creates\nan IAP for the upcoming operational period. The IAP is\nprovided to responding agencies to explain how resources\nwill be organized and managed within a single ICS structure\nto accomplish operational objectives. Even though the\nprocess is structured, it should be considered a mental\nmodel that can be accomplished at any level of rigor and in\nthe field without the need for excessive documentation.\nWhat is important is that it provides a predictable and\ndependable cycle of planning and decision-making.\nWithout a robust Planning Section to facilitate this\ndeliberate process, or Logistics Section to anticipate\nresource needs as inputs to planning, Unified Command\nneeded to spend precious leadership time reconciling and\nharmonizing incident objectives and associated resourcing\nstrategies. It was also forced to continually troubleshoot\nand make adjustments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c checking, rechecking, making\nassignments, and then making reassignments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which\ncreated confusion among responders. This took away from\nUnified Command\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to see the broader emergency unfold and engage, coordinate with, and as\nneeded employ LAWA civilian counter-parts in addressing non-security issues like mass care and the\ndeliberate planning needed for a speedy transition to recovery.\nFigure 5: FEMA Planning \"P\" Of fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 37\nThe complexity of conducting multi-agency emergency response and security operations at a major\nairport like LAX requires rapid and disciplined build-out of ICS structure, full inclusion of all disciplines -\npublic safety and civilian - in that structure, and application of a deliberate and predictable process of\nplanning and decision-making that can effectively drive response and recovery operations.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 6.1: Make efforts to address the naturally occurring organizational bias that may\ninhibit full integration of public safety and civilian operations in unified incident command.\nOn November 1, the professionalism and spirit of interagency collaboration among all of the agencies\ninvolved was the primary factor in what was a remarkably successful response to a very serious threat.\nPublic safety leadership was very mindful of the importance of resolving the security issue as safely\nand rapidly as possible and included civilian operations in all decision-making. However, a tendency\nfor public safety to see the incident in primarily security terms and a tendency for civilian operations\nnot to fully assume its role with a stronger place in the incident command structure meant that the\nvoice of operations was not as strong as it should have been. Joint civilian-public safety training and\nexercises would help further strengthen the growing spirit of collaboration even further.\nRecommendation 6.2: Expand LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Readiness Assessment and Performance Improvement Drills\nto train and evaluate staff in executing incident command and the build-out of an ICS organization.\nAn important opportunity for building greater public safety-civilian operations familiarity is in the\nnewly launched incident command training program \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Readiness Assessment and Performance\nImprovement Drills (RAPID). RAPID is designed to strengthen the skills of LAWA personnel who will fill\nkey incident management roles in an emergency. An important factor on November 1 was a lack of\npeople with the necessary training, equipment, and technology. The capability to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapidly\u00e2\u20ac establish\nthe logistics of a fully functioning ICP would have better supported the Unified Command and freed\nleadership to address more strategic concerns. RAPID workshops and exercises should drive joint ICS\nreadiness and stress greater public safety-civilian integration.\nRecommendation 6.3: Advance on-going \u00e2\u20ac\u0153position-specific\u00e2\u20ac training for police, civilian personnel,\nand public safety partners to ensure readiness to fulfill key roles in the incident command structure.\nPart of creating a robust ICS structure is ensuring enough properly trained and experienced personnel\nare available to fill key roles during an incident. LAX has created a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tiered\u00e2\u20ac system symbolized by color\n(similar to the different colored belts that classify Six Sigma) to incentivize staff to improve their\nemergency management and response abilities. They have also partnered with the City of Los Angeles\nDepartment of Emergency Management to provide airport staff with position-specific courses.\nPosition-specific training readies select staff to fill key roles in the ICS structure (e.g., Planning Section\nChief, Logistics Section Chief, etc.). Lack of qualified staff to fill these roles was largely the problem\nthat prevented the build-out of the ICS organization. There were a lot of people around to help but\nnot many with the skills and experience to do what was needed on behalf of leadership. Roles like\nLogistics Chief do not need to be done by a public safety official who might otherwise be better used.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 38 Observations and Recommendations\nObservation 7: Incident Command Post (ICP) and Supporting Capabilities\nThe ICP must be secure, well-organized, in reasonable proximity to the emergency, have the staff and\ntechnical capability needed to maintain situational awareness, and enable command and control.\nThe incident on November 1, 2013 is a reminder that what may first begin as a straight forward \u00e2\u20ac\u0153call for\nservice\u00e2\u20ac may rapidly escalate into a much greater emergency, particularly at a facility like LAX. Decisions\nmade by the first arriving supervisor concerning the establishment of an ICP could determine how well\nresponse operations unfold from there. Moreover, the unique aspects of public safety and emergency\nmanagement at LAX make it imperative that the airport maintain a robust capability to quickly support\nan ICP with the equipment, systems, and vehicles necessary to give an incident commander the greatest\npossible advantage in managing a crisis.\nThough Unified Command was established and multi-agency coordination was sufficient to successfully\nresolve the emergency on November 1, the location of the ICP posed security and operational risks and\nthere were shortfalls in some of the most basic incident management capabilities available to LAWAPD.\nThese factors made the functioning of the ICP less than optimal and placed drag on the ability of the\nUnified Command to conduct response operations. This in turn had an impact on the speed of recovery.\nBackground\nThe Incident Commander or Unified Command needs a physical location from which to establish the ICS\norganization, direct on-scene tactical operations, conduct incident planning, and communicate with\nother incident facilities and response assets. The selection of an appropriate ICP location must take into\nconsideration the hazards presented by the incident and/or weather conditions, the technical\ncapabilities required to support operations and interoperable communications, the proximity to the\nincident site and associated incident facilities, and the anticipated duration of the response.\nTo meet the needs of a rapidly expanding incident, the ICP must be large enough to accommodate\nessential staff and equipped to provide the needed technology to facilitate communications and\nconduct interactive planning activities with other ICS facilities and outside locations. It must also be\nsecure enough to provide an element of safety for ICP staff and near enough to the incident location to\nbe accessible to responders and executive leadership. An ICP may change locations during the event\nand be located in a vehicle, tent, or building; but wherever it is, it must be functional.\nOn responding to the shooting on November 1, the LAWAPD Watch Commander followed standard\nprotocol to obtain the LAWAPD command vehicle and travel to the incident location to establish an ICP.\nThe position selected was outside and on the upper roadway adjacent to Terminal 3. Separate ICPs\nwere initially set by LAPD and LAFD, but they were soon abandoned as these agencies transitioned to\nUnified Command with LAWAPD. In addition to the LAWAPD command vehicle, both LAPD and LAFD\nbrought command vehicles of their own. This assembly of vehicles served as the Unified Command ICP\nand the location from which LAWAPD, LAPD, LAFD, and Airport Operations would jointly orchestrate\nresponse activities for the majority of the incident.\nAs the Incident Commanders from the responding agencies along with the respective vehicles\nassembled to organize Unified Command outside Terminal 3, deputy commanders and other support\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 39\npersonnel from each of those agencies also started to coalesce at the ICP location. While Unified\nCommand was taking shape, assignments were made to fill ICS staff positions to include Section Chiefs\nfor Operations, Logistics, and Planning. A Safety Officer, Liaison Officer, and Public Information Officer\n(PIO) were also appointed.\nAs the ICP was located outdoors, on an elevated roadway, and in close proximity to the initial shooting\nlocation within Terminal 3, it was soon realized that the location posed a potential security and safety\nrisk. In response, LAWAPD positioned two teams of marksman atop parking structures across the\nterminal roadway as a precaution to counter the threat of additional shooters and protect the ICP.\nAnalysis\nThe initial decision to create an ICP outside Terminal 3 was based on a narrow assessment of the\nincident scope and, while it served its purpose, it proved to be far from ideal. The proximity of the ICP\nto the active shooter incident caused delay in the establishment of Unified Command, as LAFD was\ninitially reluctant to relocate due to the unresolved security situation. The outdoor location and noise\nlevel on a still operating airport also challenged the ability of incident command leadership to simply\ncommunicate with the steadily growing crowd people congregating around the center of the ICP.\nAccess to the ICP was not secure and the arrival of individuals not having an incident command role\nfurther complicated the ability to maintain a sense of order and discipline in the functioning of the ICP.\nResponding command vehicles had only basic supplies and lacked essential resources such as airport\nplans, map overlays, aerial photos, charts, easels, vests, and other such material needed to meet the\nneeds of Unified Command for organizing assets and prominently displaying this information to others.\nThe LAWAPD command vehicle, though perhaps adequate for smaller emergencies, was not sufficient to\nfacilitate a meeting of the Unified Command and senior members of the staff. Nor does it possess a full\nsuite of communications equipment needed to support multi-agency command and control by the\nUnified Command team. Despite the technological sophistication of the ARCC, none of that technology\nwas available to the ICP to include CCTV access, nor was the ICP able to directly link to the City EOC.\nThough the LAPD command vehicle had aerial video downlink capability to receive feeds from LAPD\nhelicopters, LAWAPD does not enjoy that same technological advantage for aerial imagery.\nIn addition to Unified Command activities, LAWAPD reception and staging of arriving resources and\nseveral other response functions were co-located or adjacent to the ICP. The number of personnel,\nvehicles, and activities moving around or being conducted in close proximity caused confusion and made\nit difficult for the ICP to operate throughout the incident. Knowing that Unified Command and the ICP\nhad the most up-to-date incident information, numerous other responding agencies, as well as City of\nLos Angeles officials and airport executive leadership, crowded the ICP in an attempt to gather gain\nawareness, causing further distraction. Partway through the first operational period, an attempt was\nmade to move the ICP inside the terminal to gain better control and access restrooms and other\namenities, but this area also became too overcrowded to provide a more conducive environment.\nUnified Command realized early that the Terminal 3 location (whether inside or outside) was not\nsatisfactory, especially with the need to manage wide area security operations and support a continuing\ninvestigation, along with the expansion of command structure that those activities would entail. Unified\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 40 Observations and Recommendations\nCommand therefore initiated action to relocate the ICP to LAFD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fire Station 5. However, with the\nthreat situation still unknown, and civilians and officers still potentially in harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way, the leadership\ndecided not to move prematurely in an effort to maintain continuity. Once the CTA had been cleared\nand reopened, the ICP was relocated to Fire Station 5 at 6:00 PM. As ICP activities waned, the ICP was\nmoved a final time to the LAWAPD Headquarters building at 7:15 AM on November 2.\nLike the need to improve personnel readiness to conduct incident command operations, it is also\nimportant to support those personnel with the right incident command facility/location, and with the\nequipment, systems, and vehicles that will give them greatest advantage in the interest of public safety.\nLAWAPD and the LAWA Emergency Management Division do not currently possess the basic tools\nnecessary to support multi-agency incident command and efforts must be made to address those gaps.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 7.1: Establish and equip Fire Station 5 as a permanent ICP and determine site\nselection criteria and pre-identify alternatives ICP locations conducive to a range of scenarios.\nEquipping Fire Station 5 with basic information technology infrastructure, associated fixtures, and pre-\nstaged equipment will enable it to be used as a permanent ICP location that is secure, climate\ncontrolled, and has the necessary amenities to support extended operations. Though some\nemergencies may require an on-site ICP or at least one closer to the action, alternative ICP locations\nshould also be identified and recorded in the ICS Facilities Annex to the LAX AEP. As part of that\neffort, a set of ICP site selection criteria should be developed and provided to LAWAPD supervisors so\nthat more informed choices can be made on any ad hoc selection of an ICP should one be required.\nRecommendation 7.2: Procure an incident command post vehicle sized and equipped sufficiently to\nenable multiagency operations and ensure it is compatible with both the DOC and regional partners.\nAlthough Fire Station 5 offers many advantages as a fixed facility, it will not be conducive to\nsupporting all response scenarios LAWA may need to confront. LAWA should consider the\nprocurement of a modern mobile ICP vehicle. This would provide a flexible, secure, temperature-\ncontrolled environment for conducting command and control activities, as well as communicating\nwith agency dispatch centers, the DOC, the LAWA Clifton Moore Administration Building (possible\nlocation for JIC and Executive Command Group), and LA City and County EOCs.\nThe vehicle should be equipped with a radio suite sufficient to provide interoperability with\nsurrounding jurisdictions and other local, state and federal partners operating in and around LAX. It\nshould also have on board computer workstations, a mobile data terminal, alternative wireless and\nmobile SatComm capability, and on-board IT technology to include crisis management system (e.g.,\nWebEOC), GIS mapping, and e-mail connectivity. It should be wholly compatible with LAWA DOC and\nCity of LA City Emergency Management Division systems where practical. Wireless CCTV access from\nLAWA camera systems and video downlink capability from LAPD helicopters are also suggested.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 41\nObservation 8: Department Operations Center\nAchieving the DOC's full potential requires synchronizing the ICP/DOC interface, trained staff, and\nprocesses to support decision-making and resource management, and senior leadership participation.\nThe DOC is a physical location from which key incident management activities can be performed. The\nDOC is intended to support the ICP with information and resources, as well as aid in strategic-level\ninteragency coordination and executive decision-making. As such, the DOC represents one important\nnode in the overall incident management structure of a major emergency. The LAWA DOC is outfitted\nwith various technologies to perform these functions, and its association with the ARCC provides it with\naccess to information and direct communications with a range of airport activities and partners. On\nNovember 1, 2013, the DOC played a useful role in managing non-security response issues. However, it\nwas largely ineffective in supporting the ICP or enabling strategic-level awareness and decision-making.\nBackground\nAccording to FEMA, the core functions of an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) include coordination,\ncommunication, resource allocation and tracking, and information collection, analysis and dissemination\nrelated to a specific incident. EOCs are generally organized along ICS lines to mirror the structure at an\nICP and are configured to expand, as necessary, to support large-scale and/or a multi-agency response.\nThe primary difference between an EOC and an ICP are that the EOC is normally a permanent facility and\nit does not usually exercise control over response assets in the way an ICP does, although it may.\nRole of the Department Operations Center \u00e2\u20ac\u201c In most cases, EOCs act as one key part of a larger\nsystem of incident management and networked multiagency coordination, with the on-scene ICP at\none end and a web of agency, city, county, and/or State operations and communications centers on\nthe other. Most EOCs perform two primary functions:\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Develop, maintain, and share situational awareness, support executive decision-making, facilitate\ninteragency communications and coordination, and provide public information; and\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Assist the ICP and response agencies by acquiring resources, performing overhead tasks better\nmanaged away from the incident scene, and coordinating with other partners on issues at the\nperiphery of the emergency and outside the immediate control of the ICP.\nTo distinguish it from the City of Los Angeles EOC, LAWA maintains a DOC to support response\noperations at LAX. The functioning and operational rhythms of an ICP and the DOC are and should be\ninterdependent. As such, this relationship must be well synchronized and supported by a continuous\nexchange of incident management information. Unlike an ICP, which is organized around command\nand control of incident operations, the DOC is intended to deliver more strategic-level support, to\ninclude planning and resource management. Having a broad overview of the emergency, the DOC is\nalso positioned to provide executive staff with a vantage point from which to obtain general\nsituational awareness and to make key policy decisions as needed. Similar to an ICP, the DOC must\nhave the capacity to be scalable and expand and contract as required. The more complex the crisis,\nthe more robust the DOC staffing and structure should be to meet the challenge.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 42 Observations and Recommendations\nICP / DOC Relationship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Among the most important functions of the DOC (and thus the ARCC in\nsupport of the DOC) are developing and maintaining a common operational picture and support for\nincident action planning. As discussed previously, a common operational picture (COP) is a single\nidentical depiction of incident-specific information that can be accessed by multiple units. The shared\nsituational awareness the COP provides is then the base from which collaborative planning and\ncoordinated operations occur. That collaboration is dependent on regular and continuous contact\nbetween ICP and DOC leadership, to include periodic situation reporting by the ICP Planning Section.\nAs situation assessment and deliberate planning are performed in the ICP Planning Section, that\ninformation should be exchanged with the DOC Planning Section. The DOC Planning Section advises\nthat process with added perspective and situational awareness, works with the ICP to identify\nresource gaps to be managed in support of ICP planning, and helps to synchronize incident objectives.\nThis exchange then enables Unified Command and LAWA executive leadership to be in harmony and\ntogether better develop and manage the achievement of those objectives. Figure 6 represents the\nsynchronous relationship that should exist between the ICP and the DOC.\nFigure 6: ICP - DOC Synchronization\nDOC Mobilization \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LAX created both the DOC and ARCC slightly more than three years ago and co-\nlocated them in one building with the intent of providing an efficient means of capitalizing on ARCC\ncapability to support incident management while at the same time minimizing the impact to ongoing\nairport operations. The active shooter incident on November 1, 2013 is the first time the DOC has\nbeen activated to Level 3 (high) since opening. During the incident, the DOC was made operational at\nnearly the same time as the ICP was established. The decision to activate the DOC was prompted by\nalerts from the LAWAPD Communications Unit and the ARCC/APIIC.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 43\nThe DOC was initially staffed with 11 personnel and grew to 30 by mid-afternoon on November 1,\n2013. It remained open for three operational periods, and demobilized at 6:00 PM. on November 2.\nThe following agencies provided staffing for the DOC during one or more operational periods:\nLAWA\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Airport Operations\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Airport Police\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Public Relations\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Facilities Management Group\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Customer Service\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Emergency Management\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Commercial Development Group\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Information Technology Group\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Ground Transportation Group\nPartner Agencies\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Transportation Security Administration\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 American Red Cross\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 LA Co. Department of Mental Health\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Los Angeles Police Department\nKey DOC Roles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The focus of key ICS staff positions at the DOC is very similar to that of counterparts\nin the ICP, with the exception that these roles more typically perform as enablers and facilitators of\nactivity in support of the ICP and executive-level decision-making. The DOC Operations Section Chief\nis concerned about problem-solving and advising on ICP implementation of strategy and tactics to\ncarry out incident objectives, and may control some operational tasks directly as required. The\nPlanning Section Chief provides the ICP and executive leadership with situational awareness and\nmanages the DOC part of the planning process. The Logistics Section Chief provides the resources and\nservices requested by the ICP. The Finance and Administration Section Chief is responsible for overall\nmanagement of costs and contracts. As such, in a major event, these roles need to be performed by\nseasoned staff with the requisite training, skills, and leadership gravitas to be effective in a crisis. On\nNovember 1, Airport Operations Managers primarily filled these key positions within the ICS structure.\nExecutive Leadership \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Integrating executive leadership into the incident management framework is\nessential to inform response and recovery strategy development and drive key policy decisions.\nExecutive leaders provide overarching guidance, authorize resources, and in many cases grant\nresponders the authority to act on their behalf during an incident response. Based on their executive\nexperience and position, they can provide insight into overarching considerations that might better\ninform and enable response and recovery operations on the ground. Executive leaders can also\nstreamline interagency coordination on a peer-to-peer basis when problems arise or an impasse\nneeds to be bridged. The best way for senior leaders to fulfill these key roles is to maintain direct\nassociation with the activities of the DOC. On November 1, most executives went directly to the ICP\nand did not maximize the use of the DOC or provide senior-level guidance to or from that facility.\nAnalysis\nOn November 1, 2013, the DOC played a valuable role in addressing non-security response issues that\nwere not being addressed by the ICP. However, not having operational assets assigned to it, the DOC\nbecame preoccupied with organizing and managing those non-security tasks which overwhelmed its\nability to perform its primary mission. With the exception of airport operations liaisons assigned to the\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 44 Observations and Recommendations\nICP, there was virtually no interface between the DOC and Unified Command leadership at the ICP to\ncoordinate on airport-wide response planning and resource management. Nor did the Unified\nCommand make use of DOC technology or other resources available to it.\nARCC personnel who made up the initial core of DOC staffing did not have the necessary ICS position-\nspecific training to perform key DOC roles, nor were they sufficiently senior enough to wield the\nauthority needed. The DOC never was able to energize an operational rhythm around the Planning \u00e2\u20ac\u0153P\u00e2\u20ac\ncycle and synchronize and integrate with the operational rhythm of the ICP as that facility was similarly\nchallenged. There was no disciplined situation reporting up from the ICP to the DOC and the DOC never\nproduced a common operational picture for the ICP or executive leadership. Absent the benefit of a\nsenior public safety leader in the Operations Section Chief role, the DOC was unable to effectively relate\nthe escalating non-security issues attendant to the larger emergency to the ICP. Nor could it integrate\nwith ICP planning related to CTA clearing operations, perimeter security, or eventual airport recovery.\nPerspectives on Role \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Throughout the incident, the ICP and DOC did not have a shared understanding\nof roles and responsibilities, especially for activities related to non-security issues such as passenger\nassistance, the repopulation of terminals, recovery of facilities, and the resumption of airport\noperations. The ICP tended to view the DOC as solely focused on civilian aspects of airport operations,\nrather than supporting the entire breadth of emergency response and recovery. The ICP therefore did\nnot appreciate the overall value of the DOC in providing airport-wide situational awareness or in\nfacilitating integrated public safety-civilian operations planning.\nOver time, the DOC continued to lose ground with regard to situational awareness of ICP activities and\npriorities. The ICP established goals and timelines for reopening the CTA, but did not effectively\ncoordinate all necessary activities with or through the DOC and consequently did not have situational\nawareness of mission-essential airport and airline operations. Passenger care and recovery objectives\nassumed for handling by the DOC appeared complementary on the surface, but they could not be\ncarried out independently because they required collaboration with ICP response operations,\nparticularly with response strategies and tactics associated with CTA clearing and perimeter security.\nICP/DOC Interface \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The planning processes of both the DOC and the ICP were not robust or\nsynchronized and their respective incident objectives were not jointly developed with the intent to be\nmutually supporting. While the two entities did communicate via Airport Operations liaisons at the\nICP, they failed to harmonize their activities. The DOC staff felt that they lacked good situational\nawareness of what decisions were being made at the ICP, which led them to take a more passive role\nas they expected the ICP to push information and assignments to them. The ICP assumed that the\nDOC was independently handling airport operations related issues, so they did not seek to engage\nwith the DOC or provide information. The assumption at the ICP was that the civilian Airport\nOperations staff at the ICP were facilitating all of those requirements with the DOC.\nStaffing and Personnel Readiness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Most of the personnel who are expected to staff the DOC are new\nto those roles, as the DOC is only operational during exercises, planned events, or real-world\nemergencies. Build-out of key ICS staff sections like Planning was limited, due to the unavailability of\npeople who could be pulled from their regular duties and were also familiar with DOC operations.\nEven though some key DOC positions were filled, these people were often redirected to address \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot\u00e2\u20ac\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 45\nproblems as these cropped up. While LAWA has placed a general priority on training staff on ICS\npractices, the reality is that only a small percentage of the staff identified to work in the DOC have\nmore than a basic level ICS training. That training is not sufficient to function in key DOC roles. Given\nthese staffing and readiness issues, as the intensity of the incident increased, DOC functioning\ndevolved into largely a process of handling problems on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first in - first out\u00e2\u20ac basis. Its focus also\nshifted from the totality of the crisis to performing as a civilian ICP centered on non-security concerns.\nWhen fully established, Unified Command at the ICP consisted primarily of high-ranking leaders from\nLAWAPD, LAFD, and LAPD (and included a mid-level Airport Operations manager). In contrast, the\nstaffing of key ICS roles in the DOC was comprised of mid-level Airport Operations managers.\nAlthough highly dedicated and professional in executing their duties on November 1, these individuals\nwere at a distinct disadvantage in attempting to fulfill their assigned ICS role without the necessary\ntraining and authority. They were also faced with addressing issues that may have been better suited\nto more senior LAWA staff, to include interacting with the FAA on decisions related to air traffic.\nExecutive Leadership \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Even though LAWA executive management was deeply involved in response and\nrecovery efforts on November 1 and 2, they were not provided the full benefit of real-time situational\nawareness concerning the totality of the emergency as it was unfolding. Nor was there a place for\nsenior management to effectively \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plug-in\u00e2\u20ac to the emergency management decision-making process.\nThe ICP was appropriately focused on security priorities and the DOC did not evolve sufficiently to\nsupport that level of decision-making. Having a more informed perspective, away from the heat of the\naction, would have permitted management to anticipate and get ahead of emerging issues and direct\nrefinements in response and recovery objectives, to include the harmonization of security and non-\nsecurity plans, especially those related to airside operations, mass care and CTA recovery.\nLAWA has already made a major investment in DOC/ARCC capabilities and is committed to ongoing\ntraining in ICS practices (to include position-specific training for those in line to staff the DOC). These\nfactors, along with the progressive spirit of interagency cooperation evident on November 1, suggests\nthat LAWA is already well positioned to make the improvements needed in DOC functioning, ICP/DOC\nsynchronization, and DOC support to executive leadership that are indicated here.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 8.1: Resolve staffing and process constraints that limit the DOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to\ndevelop a common operational picture and engage in coordinated incident planning with the ICP.\nDespite the unflagging efforts of LAWA personnel and others who provided DOC support on\nNovember 1, the complexity and scope of this incident highlighted the need for enhanced capabilities,\nboth in basic processes and the type and level of staff assigned. As previously cited, the DOC/ARCC\nhas no definition of a common operational picture; no procedure for creating and maintaining one;\nand no means to get that picture to the ICP to help in synchronizing the planning and decision-making\nactivities of the entire incident management team. Moreover, there is little guidance for staff in the\ndrafting of a LAWA-specific IAP and no protocols for how to harmonize DOC planning efforts with\nthose of the ICP, when one is established. A DOC standard operating procedures needs to address\nthese shortfalls.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 46 Observations and Recommendations\nOn November 1, key DOC roles were all filled by Airport Operations Managers. Although Airport\nOperations Managers are highly capable, these key ICS roles may be better played by more senior\nindividuals with the requisite day-to-day expertise. For example, the Operations Section Chief position\non November 1 may have been better addressed by a LAWAPD Assistant Chief and that of Logistics\nChief by someone from LAWA Administration. Likewise, the DOC Director role may have been\nreserved for the Director of Emergency Management. Staffing plans for the DOC should be reviewed\nand refined accordingly, to include assumptions for around-the-clock staffing in shifts.\nRecommendation 8.2: Conduct training and exercises that require competence in the exchange of\nsituational awareness, coordinated planning, and joint decision-making between the ICP and DOC.\nThere is a tremendous level of investment in technology and information-collection capacity resident\nin the ARCC and, by default, the DOC. Little if any of that technology mattered to the execution of\noperations out of the ICP. Having information versus getting that information in a useful form to\nwhere it can do the most good to plan and coordinate response operations are two entirely different\nthings. Assuming the assignment of the right people to the right roles in the DOC, the DOC/ARCC\nneeds to practice and hone the skills necessary to provide situational awareness to those in the ICP\nwho need it and in the form that they need it. The DOC planning function needs to likewise train and\nexercise directly with LAWAPD personnel who may fill the Planning Chief role to work out mutual\nexpectations and synchronize approach. The same holds true for all of the other ICS positions in the\nDOC. Realistic training and exercises like LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RAPID should provide staff the opportunity to test\nand evaluate their skills in a controlled environment before a being activated in a real-world event.\nRecommendation 8.3: Establish an Executive Command Group of top senior leadership at LAWA\nand supplement it with senior leaders from other organizations as appropriate to the situation.\nLAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incident management model needs to incorporate provisions for formal engagement of\nexecutive leadership in the process of response and recovery decision-making at a strategic level. An\nExecutive Command Group (ECG) should be formed as a leadership council chaired by the Executive\nDirector or Deputy. It should also include a limited number of other senior executives from across the\norganization who may also be filling specific incident command roles (e.g., Chief of Airport Police,\nDirector of Emergency Management, etc.). The DOC Director would regularly brief members of the\nECG on the status of an emergency. The ECG would be convened only as needed to address high-level\nmatters of policy that may have implications for response or recovery operations but not otherwise\ninvolve operational tactics. A decision to close the airport to all aviation traffic might be the level of\ndecision such a group would consider. The ECG should be supported by the DOC and have the\ncapability to convene virtually if necessary. It will thus require reliable communications connectivity.\nPolicy and protocols for the ECG should be codified in the LAX AEP and DOC SOP.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 47\nObservation 9: Mutual Aid and Resource Management\nA well-structured resource management process supports the ability of incident command at both the\nICP and DOC to identify needs and then source, stage, employ, track, and demobilize response assets.\nResource management during an incident response is a process by which resources are acquired and\napplied to enable specific tactics and strategies associated with incident objectives. Basic resource\nmanagement practices that begin right at the outset of an incident \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as sourcing, tracking, and\nstaging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ensure that the right resources arrive at the right place, at the right time, and in the right\nquantities. Resources are divided into two types \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tactical Resources, those used in direct response\nroles, and Support Resources, those that enable the response, but are not tactically engaged.\nIn the response to the November 1 active shooter incident, resource management primarily revolved\naround law enforcement capabilities (Tactical Resources) that arrived, in many cases, as unrequested\nmutual aid. Though there was a requirement for water and health and comfort items to support\npassenger assistance efforts (Support Resources), for the most part, these were not significant resource\nmanagement challenges. However, the management of Tactical Resources in the mutual aid response\nrevealed possible weaknesses in overall resource management capability that merit some examination\nas these may become more critical under other crisis scenarios.\nBackground\nThe resource management process can\nbe separated into two parts: resource\nplanning prior to a crisis and resource\nmanagement during a response.\nResource planning attempts to identify\nresource requirements under various\nscenarios and establishes protocols for\nobtaining additional resources through\nmutual aid agreements or other means.\nDuring an actual response, as ongoing\nincident assessment efforts inform\npriorities and needs, resources are\nordered, procured, and tracked using a\nresource management process or\nsystem. Such resources are often obtained\nthrough mutual aid and can be in the form of\npersonnel, teams, facilities, equipment, and/or supplies. When no longer needed, resources are\ndemobilized. This ensures that all incident resources are tracked from request to redeployment, as\ndepicted in Figure 7. Like ICS in general, resource management during an incident should be scalable\nand flexible to meet the changing needs of the incident. Whether a Tactical Resource is acquired via\nmutual aid or not, this process of accountability and resource management still applies.\nFigure 7: Resource Management Process\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 48 Observations and Recommendations\nAs the initial response to the November 1 shooting took shape, additional tactical resources were also\nneeded to: establish perimeter security; manage traffic control; clear and secure the CTA; and provide\nassistance to airport residents and airline passengers impacted by the event. Each of these missions\ndemanded some level of planning and requirements definition. In addition, the resources ultimately\nassigned to these missions represented both a capability and an expense that have to be tracked and\naccounted for. In any emergency response, it is important for the Incident Commander to know what is\nneeded, where it is, and how to get to it. The more effective the resource management process, the\nfaster decisions can be made, response operations can be implemented, and recovery achieved.\nAs the LAWAPD response to the shooting at Terminal 3 unfolded, both requested and self-deployed\npolice resources either arrived at staging areas hastily assembled near the ICP or self-reported to other\nlocations where they assumed needs existed. Another large influx of police resources occurred when\nLAPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Air10 helicopter initiated a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153help call\u00e2\u20ac for support once unable to communicate with Unified\nCommand. While Unified Command certainly benefitted from the large influx of police resources\navailable to assist, it struggled to account for, organize, and manage these resources effectively as a part\nof the overall response. Later in the day, in an effort to assist, LAPD established an off-site staging area\nfor law enforcement assets at the nearby Ahmanson Training Center.\nAnalysis\nThe initial response to an active shooter incident is understandably chaotic, however, once an incident\nmanagement structure is established, normal resource management protocols should be implemented.\nThis allows Unified Command to: 1) account for all resources already on scene; and 2) establish resource\nmanagement functions within the ICS structure to order, procure, track, and demobilize resources for\nthe remainder of the incident.\nMutual Aid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The immediate response from mutual aid partners during the November 1 incident is a\ntestament to the cooperative spirit and willingness of those jurisdictions to assist LAX at a moment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nnotice. A Request for Mutual Aid is a well-defined process in LA County. LAWAPD never made an\nofficial request for Mutual Aid through the LA County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office, which coordinates mutual aid in\nthe County. Having enough law enforcement resources was never an issue. The response of\nresources from LAPD was quick and sufficient to manage the incident. In one instance, an LAWAPD\nSergeant took personal initiative to contact the South Bay Regional Dispatch and ask for additional\nhelp. This was not directed by the Unified Command or really needed. Had the incident been much\nlarger or more significant those resources may have been necessary.\nSome initial LAWAPD and LAPD units formed contact teams on arrival to make entry into Terminal 3,\nwhile other on- and off-duty responders from LAWAPD and mutual aid partners reported directly to\nthe CTA and the ICP while others reported to pre-designated locations to implement perimeter\nsecurity and traffic control plans. After establishing Unified Command, one of the first challenges was\nidentifying what mutual aid resources were officially deployed or had self-deployed to the incident,\nwhere they were staged or operating, and what additional capabilities or resources were needed to\nmeet incident objectives.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 49\nAccountability and Staging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c It was difficult for responding agencies to maintain accountability during\nthe initial response, as mutual aid resources did not participate in a unified check-in process on arrival\nat the scene, some resources had self-deployed, and the lack of interoperable communications\nbetween some agencies contributed to confusion and duplication of resource requests. As Unified\nCommand was being established, it required extra effort to go back and reconcile the status of\nindividual agency resources into a common picture of available response capabilities and shortfalls.\nThere was no common view of what resources had deployed, where they were located at the incident,\nwhat roles they were performing, and whether additional resources would be needed.\nAnother challenge for Unified Command was the large numbers of vehicles parked on both upper and\nlower CTA roadways. Without a pre-designated staging area, resources reported directly to the scene\nand were quickly assigned responsibilities within terminals and parking structures. Unified Command\nattempted to get responders to relocate their vehicles to other locations, but in many cases it was\nunable to determine who the vehicles belonged to, or the location of the operators. As these vehicles\nwere delaying the reopening of the CTA, Unified Command eventually had to resort to towing\nresponders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vehicles out of roadways.\nResource Planning and Tracking - In the absence of built-out ICS structures at the ICP, and the lack of\neffective communication and planning processes between the ICP and DOC, it is unclear how resource\nneeds were identified, prioritized, and fulfilled across the breadth of the entire incident. The lack of\nan established planning process between the ICP and DOC meant that resource needs were not\nsystematically assessed to determine shortfalls in capabilities, ways to fill those gaps were not\nidentified, and resources committed to the incident were not tracked. The Planning Section should\nwork with Operations to identify resource requirements for the incident, while an expanded Logistics\nSection provides resource support to Operations. Without robust capabilities in these areas, resource\nrequests and tracking activities were decentralized which made it difficult for Unified Command to\ndetermine whether incident resource needs were being met effectively.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 9.1: Refine mutual aid agreements with public safety partners to include\nguidance on deployment and staging, and conduct periodic training and mobilization drills.\nLAX is a complex facility with a layout unfamiliar to many neighboring responders, as well as unique\nhazards and operating conditions. LAX should conduct familiarization training and incorporate mutual\naid partners into mobilization drills tailored to test response activities. LAWA should review and\nupdate mutual aid agreements to ensure staging areas are identified and response protocols are\nclearly stated, as this will improve organization and accountability in the earliest stages of incident\nresponse. Staging areas need to identified and recorded in the LAX ICS Facilities Annex to the AEP.\nRecommendation 9.2: Establish practices for resource management, asset tracking and control,\ndocument in an annex to the LAX AEP and train in the processes and technology.\nResource management during an incident is an iterative process of evaluating and applying resources\nto achieve incident objectives in accordance with plans, procedures, and agreements developed in\nadvance. In anticipation of similar no-notice or fast-breaking incidents requiring extensive mutual aid\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 50 Observations and Recommendations\nassistance, LAX must develop systems that will allow them to more effectively manage the expected\ninflow of multi-agency resource support. NFPA 1600, NIMS resource management guidance\ndocuments, and the California Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) Resource\nOrdering and Tracking Guide are references available to emergency managers. These guides provide\ndirection on how to codify resource management policies, conduct resource needs assessments, and\nimplement processes to employ, manage, track, and demobilize resources.\nRecommendation 9.3: Consider the use of WebEOC and its resource management module for both\na virtual means of interagency information sharing and a way to handle requests for support.\nInitial response operations are expected to be chaotic, but the use of a Crisis Management System\n(CMS) can help to capture and report data during an incident and better enable systematic resource\nmanagement. A system like the resource management module in WebEOC would provide improved\nvisibility of available resources and some automated functionality for the conduct of resource\nmanagement activities during an incident. WebEOC is the CMS currently employed by the City of Los\nAngeles and the State of California. Its use at LAX is recommended to provide the airport with\nregional interoperability. If common systems and practices are widely employed, these systems\nwould better enable interagency resource management, especially in complex emergencies.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 51\nResponse Operations\nThe active shooter event at LAX on November 1, 2013 was tragic in its outcome, and the loss of life and\nphysical injuries sustained by the victims were unconscionable. Airport operations were greatly\ndisrupted, most aviation services were suspended, and thousands of people were delayed and\notherwise inconvenienced. However, in light of the lethal and uncertain nature of the security threat\nthat emerged, the need to manage the situation with extreme caution, and the overall complexity of the\nairport environment, it is remarkable that the majority of the LAX CTA returned to normal operations\nwithin a matter of hours. Almost as notable was the fact that Terminal 3, the scene of a horrific crime,\nwas also returned to full service the following day on November 2.\nNotwithstanding the resumption of most airport operations on the afternoon of November 1, the\nresponse to the incident revealed a number of opportunities for improvement in general emergency\npreparedness beyond incident command. Those that merit particular attention are addressed in this\nsection of the report. While each emergency is unique, there are a few aspects to response operations\nthat seem common to most. These include: 1) alerting and informing the people impacted; 2) organizing\nthe response and taking steps to isolate and secure the area; 3) implementing actions to address the\nneeds of victims and those displaced; 4) performing activities to stabilize the crisis and provide public\nsafety; and 5) returning things to normal. The observations that follow address each of these in turn.\nObservation 10: Public Mass Notification\nDeveloping and integrating a full range of strategies and systems for public alert and mass notification\nare vital to ensuring awareness, safety, and comfort of those impacted by a crisis.\nA major airport like LAX is a tremendously complex and confined environment that includes a network\nof hundreds of loosely connected yet interdependent entities that interact with and service not only a\nresident population equal to that of a small city but also thousands of additional travelers and transient\nvisitors. Many of those people may be unfamiliar with the airport, some do not speak English, and some\nhave disabilities or other special needs. Given the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s compact footprint and often high population\ndensity, providing timely alerts and accurate mass notifications of an emergency to those in harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way\nis crucial to managing their behavior and minimizing their exposure.\nBackground\nMass public alerts are best accomplished through the use of an integrated Mass Notification System\n(MNS) and associated strategy. The goal of any mass notification system is to ensure all persons are\ninformed of an emergency regardless of their location. According to the National Fire Protection\nAssociation, there are various types of MNS for communicating directly to targeted individuals and\ngroups that might not be in a contiguous area. 7 These systems include: 1) in-building fire Emergency\nVoice/Alarm Communications systems; 2) in-building mass notifications (to transmit messages for\nemergencies other than fires); 3) wide-area mass notifications (for large, contiguous or multiple outdoor\nareas), and 4) distributed recipient mass notification systems (DRMNS).\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 52 Observations and Recommendations\nOn November 1, 2013, approximately 4,500 passengers self-evacuated from Terminals 1, 2, and 3 and\nmore than 20,000 passengers were sheltered in place on aircraft and in terminals. At the time, LAX did\nnot have an MNS available to directly alert people across the airport of the emergency. The majority of\nthe terminals at LAX are leased by airline tenants who control their own public address (PA) systems.\nMoreover, PA systems in terminals managed by LAWA are not centrally controlled. As a result, no\nimmediate or on-going PA announcements were made to people in the terminals and around the CTA.\nHowever, LAX did employ a variety of other methods to provide emergency related information to\ninternal and external audiences:\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 LAWAPD Communications radioed police officers who, through direct contact, notified as many\nmembers of the public as possible while those officers were responding to the emergency.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The Airport Police Information and Intelligence Center (APIIC) used the computer-aided notification\nsystem Everbridge to alert a select list of LAWAPD, operations, and management executives.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 The ARCC Duty Manager also used the Everbridge system to notify a much broader audience of\nairport stakeholders to include LAWA staff, the airlines, concessionaires, and other agencies.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 LAWA operations staff, customer service representatives, and other airport personnel on-scene\nprovided direct information to LAX tenants and travelers across the CTA.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Within minutes of the incident, LAWA Media and Public Relations Division began communicating\nwith the media and general public using the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official Twitter account, @LAX_Official.\nThe @LAX_Official account was designated as the official source of incident information. More than 500\ntweets were sent over a 2-day period, along with nearly 400 personal engagements with LAX twitter\nfollowers. The LAWA Media and Public Relations Division organized several news conferences, posted\nregular incident updates to the LAX website, and emailed incident updates to pre-identified external\ngroups including media outlets, airport stakeholders, elected leaders, and community members.\nAnalysis\nLAWA made significant efforts to alert and inform the general public and, specifically, the airport\nresident and transient populations throughout the entire airport disruption that followed the active\nshooter event on November 1, 2013. However, lack of well-developed, integrated public alert and mass\nnotification systems and practices left significant gaps in communication vital to the awareness and\ncomfort of those people impacted by the incident. Various LAWA units share the responsibility and\naccountability for alert and mass notifications. PA systems in the terminals were not designed for use\nfrom a central location and were thus not employed by emergency responders. The challenges\nassociated with alert and mass notification mainly fall in three areas: protocols, operations, and systems.\nProtocols \u00e2\u20ac\u201c On November 1, several different entities within the LAX organization performed various\nforms of public alerting and communication without a common point of leadership or responsibility.\nPolice, Operations, Customer Service, and Media and Public Relations Division all provided information\nto LAWA stakeholders and/or the general public. The effort was not centrally coordinated, which\nresulted in some redundancy of effort and voids in the timely and uniform delivery of vital information\nto those most impacted by the incident. Moreover, the alert and notification effort was not\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 53\nconnected to operations at the ICP but rather functioned largely apart from it. This limited the\nincident commander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opportunity to use available public alert and notification assets to fully shape\npublic behavior and help ensure public safety.\nOperations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A primary example of the absence of effective alert and notification protocols was the\nuse of the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Everbridge system within the LAX ARCC. On notification of the incident, the APIIC,\nwhich resides within the ARCC, issued immediate Everbridge notifications to key stakeholders. At 9:25\nAM, the APIIC sent a message to the Law Enforcement Notification Group only. A select set of\npersonnel from airport operations, airport police, and LAX executive management received those\nnotifications. At 10:15 AM, the LAWA DOC Director recognized the Everbridge notifications were not\nsent to all key stakeholders. Although the DOC Director took corrective action, in the heat of DOC\nactivity, those additional notifications did not go out until 10:54 AM, almost an hour and thirty\nminutes after the initial shooting took place.\nSystems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Everbridge is LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary alert and mass notification system that currently targets\nairport stakeholders and not the general public. The system possesses the capability to broadcast\nmessages to virtually any communications device including mobile devices and desktop computers.\nFor pre-determined lists, message escalation follows the order of preference designated by the\nrecipient and stops once they confirm receipt. On November 1 and 2, the ARCC issued 45 Everbridge\nmessages. LAWAPD, LAWA DOC, Customer Service, and Media and Public Relations Division also used\ne-mail and telephone to supplement communications via Everbridge. In addition, the DOC contacted\nthe airlines to convey information to employees and passengers. Despite best efforts, all of these\ncommunications were somewhat compromised by lack of timely and accurate information exchange\nbetween the DOC and the ICP.\nAlthough PA systems associated with fire protection equipment exist in every terminal, these systems\nare not integrated in a way that permits central control nor were they accessed and used individually\nto communicate with people in those terminals. Having a single point of control over the PA systems\nin the terminals would have provided LAX with a straightforward and conventional means of notifying\npassengers across the CTA. Current public alert and mass notification technology includes Wireless\nEmergency Alert (WEA) systems that can target all mobile devices within a given geographic area.\nLAWA was not aware of and did not request support from the public alerting and mass notification\ncapabilities of the Los Angeles Emergency Management Division; however, as of this writing LAWA,\nhas collaborated with the City of Los Angeles and is now utilizing its WEA system.\nOf all the challenges LAWA had to contend with in response to the massive disruption to airport\noperations on November 1, probably the most significant issue from a public perspective was lack of\ntimely, accurate, and relevant information to those people most directly impacted by the incident. In\nthat case, the consequences were largely anxiety and inconvenience as people coped with the\nemergency using whatever information they received. In a more complex and threatening situation,\ngaps in communication to those potentially in harm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way could have more serious outcomes. Although\ncommunications efforts on November 1 were extensive, they were not sufficient.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 54 Observations and Recommendations\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 10.1: Fully integrate and exploit the potential of an LAX-wide Mass Notification\nSystem, capitalize on existing public address capability, and link these systems back to the LAX DOC.\nMNS have evolved significantly over the last decade. Starting in 2007, NFPA8 began integrating\nrequirements for MNS within building fire emergency voice/alarm communications systems, and\ncommercial applications have been designed to connect numerous facilities to provide for central\ncontrol from locations such as the ARCC. Since November 1, LAWA has launched an initiative to\ninventory all PA systems at the airport to assess the feasibility and cost of modifying them to function\nas an integrated MNS. LAWA has also established procedures to use a WEA system that will provide\npublic alerting to mobile devices across the airport.\nRecommendation 10.2: Implement a mass notification strategy that capitalizes on all forms of real-\ntime communication with the public, whether controlled by LAWA, its tenants, or regional partners.\nGeorge Moore, author of the NFPA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Designing Mass Notification Systems, notes that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mass\nNotification is more than the use of technology (equipment and systems) to perform effective\nemergency communications.\u00e2\u20ac He suggests that mass notification must be effectively incorporated\ninto the development of emergency response plans. The November 1 incident also indicates that\nthere needs to be a well-integrated strategy and set of protocols that harmonize dissemination of\npublic messaging. That strategy should state who is responsible for the entire system, how it is to be\nemployed, under what circumstances, who is to be alerted, and what messages should be delivered.\nObservation 11: Strategic Communications and Joint Information Center\nEffective coordination of messaging to influence behavior in support of incident objectives depends\non how well agencies manage public information assets within the incident command structure.\nIn an emergency, clear, accurate, and timely information about the nature of the circumstances, actions\nbeing taken in response, and what people can do themselves, can help save lives, lessen anxiety, and\nchange circumstances by informing and influencing attitudes and behavior. The ability to provide\naccurate, timely, and actionable information during a crisis requires careful planning and redundant\nforms of communication using available tools including mainstream and Social Media, as well as having\nthe cooperation of those directly involved in managing the crisis to provide insight and perspective.\nStrategic communication requires unity of effort and close collaboration among all of the agencies\ninvolved and full integration in support of the incident command structure.\nBackground\nIn recognition of the importance of strategic communications in an emergency response, ICS includes a\nPublic Information Officer (PIO) position to manage this activity. The PIO position may exist at the ICP or\nat the DOC but most importantly, it must be embedded in and be an integral part of the incident\ncommand framework. It must also work in close conjunction with the PIOs of other responding\norganizations and agencies to ensure effective and consistent messaging. Lack of coordinated and\nconsistent messaging can negatively impact public perceptions of the handling of the incident. At\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 55\nLAWA, the overarching role of PIO is performed by the Director of Media and Public Relations, while\nLAWAPD has a full-time PIO that handles messaging for the Division as well as emergency response.\nThe PIO gathers, verifies, coordinates, and disseminates accurate, accessible, and timely information on\nthe incident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cause, size, and current situation; resources committed; and other matters of general\ninterest for both internal and external use. Standing emergency plans designate one senior LAWA PIO\nand one LAWAAPD PIO to respond to the ICP during an airport emergency and or incident, including\nmulti-agency responses under Unified Command. To ensure coordination of public information during\nincidents, the Unified Command may use a JIC to support the gathering, verification, coordination, and\ndissemination of accurate, accessible, and timely information. The JIC is a central location that facilitates\noperation of the Joint Information System (JIS). Respective PIOs use a JIS to organize, integrate, and\ncoordinate information to ensure consistent messaging. Although the roles of the PIO and JIC are well\nunderstood, LAWA does not yet have fully developed protocols and/or facilities for their employment.\nThe growing use of smart phone and computer tablets by the public acting as on-the-scene reporters, as\nwell as an escalating use of social media and nearly non-existent news media reporting cycles, make it\nespecially challenging for PIOs to stay \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in front of a story.\u00e2\u20ac While all information must first be cleared by\nthe Unified Command prior to release by a PIO, misleading and inaccurate information provided to the\nmedia by nonofficial sources may be more timely than what PIOs can provide. It is therefore vital that\nPIOs have firsthand knowledge of unfolding events. This is only possible if they are appropriately\npositioned in the incident command structure to not only verify reports received from unofficial sources,\nbut also coordinate information with partner organizations and agencies. PIOs and their incident\ncommand leadership need to plan for and embrace social media technology as part of pre-incident\nplanning and ensure that their systems and JIC staffing are sufficiently robust to manage the deluge of\nboth traditional media and social networking internet activity that emergency incidents tend to attract.\nAnalysis\nAt the early stages of the response to the active shooter incident on November 1, 2013, PIOs from some\nof the responding agencies deployed to the airport initially in support of their individual organizations.\nAs incident command structure began to evolve, the LAWAPD PIO established herself as the incident PIO\nat the ICP. However, in reaction to the need to manage a growing media contingent within the secure\nperimeter of the CTA, the LAWAPD PIO was dispatched from the ICP to relocate this contingent to\nensure their safety and act as their immediate LAWA representative. Unfortunately, this need further\nstretched the PIO resources immediately available to the incident command team. As well, because the\nlocation and general arrangement of the ICP was not conducive to establishing a JIC, the function was at\nfirst slow to materialize. The LAWA Director for Media and Public Relations quickly stepped in as senior\nLAWA PIO and began aggressive efforts to assemble an overall picture of events on the ground,\ncoordinate messaging both within LAWA and across responding agencies, and organize and coordinate\nthe efforts of other PIOs. Although the strategic communications campaign was largely successful,\nchallenges related to the location of the JIC, ICP logistics, and incomplete situational awareness limited\nthe ability of the JIC function to fully establish itself and realize its ultimate potential in shaping events.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 56 Observations and Recommendations\nInitial Formation of the JIC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A LAWA PIO was dispatched to the LAWA DOC to obtain situational\nawareness and begin utilizing the LAX Emergency Communication Plan. Within several minutes of the\nincident, another LAWA PIO began disseminating information using the official LAX Twitter account.\nThe LAWAPD PIO was integrated into the larger public information effort, and PIOs from responding\nagencies were invited into an emerging, though to some extent virtual, JIC function. This included TSA\nand FBI representation via e-mail and phone-bridge.\nJIC Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Without a suitable place in which to conduct its work, the JIC function was eventually\nmoved inside Terminal 2. Because of this move away from the ICP, the PIOs were not fully integrated\ninto the activities of the incident command team; had difficulty engaging in command briefings; and\nthose PIOs who were able to participate often could not hear the information being conveyed because\nof the outdoor location of those briefings. Moreover, the JIC function was hampered by the same lack\nof general situational awareness that plagued both the ICP and the LAWA DOC. These conditions made\nit challenging for the LAWA PIO to maintain cohesion among the PIOs from the various agencies as\nneeded to support the functioning of the JIC. As a result, some PIO efforts of the responding agencies\nwere not always well coordinated. As time went on, efforts were made to relocate the JIC to Fire\nStation 5 but this move did not take place until after the CTA had been re-opened to vehicle traffic.\nJIC Operations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c While largely preoccupied with response and recovery operations, the incident\ncommand team relied heavily on the PIOs in the JIC to coordinate, produce, and disseminate public\ninformation, which they accomplished successfully through a variety of means under very challenging\nconditions. That campaign was externally focused and designed for broad consumption. It correctly\nemphasized getting timely, accurate, and relevant information to a broad external audience.\nHowever, the functioning of the JIC was not synchronized with the efforts of the LAWA DOC or\nCustomer Service unit to communicate more specific information to people who had either evacuated\nterminals or were otherwise sheltering in place in other terminals and aircraft across the airport. A\nfully coordinated campaign of emergency notification, using all means available, can help shape public\nbehavior in a way that better enables the response and allows those directly affected to take\nappropriate action that could mitigate the cascading effects or expansion of the emergency.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 11.1: Incorporate protocols for a Joint Information Center (JIC) in an annex to the\nAirport Emergency Plan to include its full integration into the ICS structure during future operations.\nThe LAWA Media and Public Relations Division has a well-developed public information and\nemergency response plan, its Director is highly conversant in the JIC concept and its application in\nincident response operations. However, the LAWA AEP and its suite of response annexes do not\nadequately address the organization and employment of a JIC and there is no plan for supporting its\nlogistics. That annex should define the structure of the JIC, the expectations of partner agencies, the\nresources required, and a list of alternative locations for its establishment, along with media briefing\nand VIP handling locations. It should also outline the linkage between strategic communications and\nmass notification efforts.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 57\nRecommendation 11.2: Implement a Joint Information System to effectively integrate information\nand ensure consistent messaging across disciplines, public agencies, and private sector partners.\nEven in an emergency of limited scope, the JIC function may not enjoy the luxury of having all of the\npeople essential to a strategic communications campaign in one place. Partner PIOs may not be able to\naccess the JIC location or there may be approvals necessary from officials not immediately at hand.\nThe need to rapidly assemble information and formulate public statements as part of a collaborative\neffort places a premium on having a process that is well organized and supported by information\ntechnology. A JIS provides the mechanism to organize, integrate, and coordinate information to ensure\ntimely, accurate, accessible, and consistent messaging across multiple jurisdictions and/or disciplines.\nIt includes the plans, protocols, procedures, and structures used to provide information during a crisis.\nObservation 12: Perimeter Security and Access Control\nPerimeter security must control access to the emergency while being flexible enough to facilitate\nentry and circulation of essential resources and the achievement of response and recovery missions.\nAn important step in response to any emergency, especially one involving an armed threat, is to\nimmediately secure and control access to the area. The LAX roadway and pedestrian network is\ncomplex with multiple avenues into and out of the airport and around the CTA. Within minutes of the\nactive shooter incident of November 1, LAWAPD implemented standing plans to secure the CTA and\nshutdown the approach roadways. Steps were also taken to implement a larger roadway closure and\ntraffic diversion plan to shunt incoming traffic away from the airport. Similarly, access to the Air\nOperations Area (AOA) was closed. Although these plans were generally well executed, they had the\nunintended consequence of also impeding the movement of essential non-public safety personnel and\nrestricting the accomplishment of non-security missions in support of the overall operation.\nBackground\nDay-to-day traffic management and perimeter security at LAX is the responsibility of the Traffic and\nSecurity Section of LAWAPD. This unit is responsible for the safe and orderly flow of vehicular and\npedestrian traffic as well as controlling access to the CTA, the AOA, and various facilities and restricted\nareas throughout LAX. As first notifications to police across the airport were going out, and as LAWA\nincident command was initially being established at Terminal 3, LAWA police supervisors were\nindependently assessing courses of action to include perimeter security measures. Radio calls from the\nICP were made to close both upper and lower level access to the CTA and to clear the CTA roadway of\ncivilian vehicles. Independent of incident command, the LAWAPD Security Access Control Unit ordered\nthe closing of all security gates accessing the AOA.\nWhile actions to establish perimeter security were taking place and as Unified Command began to\ncoalesce, LAPD and LAWAPD incident commanders jointly agreed to implement the LAPD Operation\nNighthawk traffic plan, which rerouted traffic away from the airport. Local jurisdictions adjacent to LAX,\nincluding El Segundo and Westchester, also implemented their respective traffic plans. Consistent with\nNighthawk, the California Highway Patrol and Cal Trans closed the I-105 and I-405 freeway exits leading\ninto the airport. Through these actions, all traffic to and from the airport was effectively locked down.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 58 Observations and Recommendations\nConcurrent with the activation of traffic plans and roadway closures, numerous police agencies\nresponded to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153help call\u00e2\u20ac issued by the LAPD Air10 helicopter. These supporting units staged vehicles\non both the upper and lower CTA roadways as they awaited direction from incident command. The\nuncontrolled arrival and parking of so many police vehicles at the CTA later created challenges for\nmovement across the terminal frontages and hindered the recovery of the airport. As the incident\ncommand structure formed at Terminal 3, traffic control and perimeter security were assigned to a\nTraffic Branch in that structure. Heightened access control remained in effect until late in the afternoon\nof November 1 when the CTA was cleared by law enforcement and considered safe, at which time all\naccess points were reopened.\nAnalysis\nDuring the uncertain and fluid security situation that emerged on November 1, LAWAPD supervisors\ntook quick and decisive action to rapidly secure the airport perimeter in an effort to control the threat\nand limit any additional public exposure. These perimeter security measures were implemented\nconcurrent with security operations at Terminal 3 and across the CTA. The incident command structure,\nthough ultimately unified, did not fully mature and did not have the resources or information needed to\nhave complete situational awareness of conditions surrounding the airport. This included incomplete\nawareness of the restrictive nature of the security cordon, police vehicle crowding across the CTA\nroadway, and mounting traffic congestion radiating along major arteries near LAX. All of which\nhampered ingress and circulation across the airport and slowed some response and recovery operations\ndependent on inbound mission-essential civilian staff and non-public safety resources.\nAccess Control \u00e2\u20ac\u201c While crucial to public safety and initial stabilization of the situation, the inflexibility\nand slowness to incrementally relax the posture of perimeter security at key access points once the\nimmediate threat was resolved became a major source of frustration and a significant contributor to\nless than optimal service to stranded passengers. This inflexibility negatively affected the mobilization\nof mission-essential personnel and tended to compound pedestrian and vehicle traffic congestion\naround the airport. Police officers from other jurisdictions assigned to manage perimeter checkpoints\nwere not familiar with LAX operations or access protocols and refused entry to many badged\nemployees and responders from civilian agencies. Moreover, in the absence of instructions to the\ncontrary, guards at AOA entry gates in one instance denied access to airport operations personnel\nresponding to the needs of people who had been displaced because of prior terminal evacuations.\nSituational Awareness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c During the initial hours of the response, the ICP was largely unaware of\nmounting access issues. Moreover, because there was no special guidance provided to police officers\nat perimeter security posts on rules for access control and no means to adjudicate their authenticity\nor operational need, people were either turned away or had to obtain an escort on their own. This\nincluded civilian responders from the Department on Disabilities and the Red Cross. TSA security\nofficers, pilots and flight attendants, aircraft mechanics, ground crews, and contract staff were also\ndenied access. The inability to gain entry by the people needed to staff the terminals and service the\naircraft only added to crowding issues across the CTA and the tremendous frustration of passengers\nheld on board aircraft for as many as six hours. Even the LAWA Executive Director and Director for\nMedia and Public Relations (performing remotely as the LAWA PIO) were denied access for a time.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 59\nAirport Recovery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The lethal nature of the threat situation clearly warranted the aggressive\nperimeter control measures initially implemented. However, once the initial danger was resolved and\nthe general security situation in the CTA cleared, managed entry of mission-essential personnel should\nhave been given earlier consideration. The airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to systematically recover in stages, and in\nso doing help alleviate some of the pressing consequences of the emergency, is greatly dependent on\nhelp from a range of key civilian personal. Leaders in the Unified Command were very much focused\non the safe return of the airport to normal operations as soon as practical. Nonetheless, lack of\nbroader situational awareness and absence of a clear appreciation for the problems created by an\ninflexible security cordon delayed airport recovery and exacerbated the conditions experienced by\nairport residents and travelers. There is consensus that the CTA could have been restored earlier.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 12.1: Refine perimeter security and access control plans to simultaneously isolate\nthe emergency and provide safe marshaling and passage of mission-essential personnel.\nPolice perimeter control and traffic diversion plans were, in large measure, effectively implemented\non November 1. Lessons learned revolve around the need to incorporate in those law enforcement\nplans emphasis on access rules for security checkpoints and briefing checkpoint personnel; methods\nfor adjudicating credentials and mission-essential status of persons attempting to gain entry; and\nmore robust command/control and situational awareness of perimeter security assets out of the ICP\nor alternatively the LAWA DOC. Guidelines for controlling arriving mutual aid units and diverting those\nunits to staging should also be addressed.\nRecommendation 12.2: Identify and implement marshaling areas and control points to adjudicate\naccess credentials and to organize the secure and timely movement of mission-essential personnel.\nOne of the annexes to the LAX AEP under development is focused on plotting ICS facilities to include\nthings like alternative ICP locations and resource staging areas. As a part of developing that annex,\nperimeter checkpoints should also be plotted along with marshaling areas for mission-essential\npersonnel and control points where access credentials can be adjudicated as needed to ensure the\nintegrity of the security cordon and speedy resolution of access issues. Resource requirements to staff\nthese sites should also be planned. Airport tenants with mission-essential roles should be familiarized\nwith these locations in advance and employing these marshaling and control points should be\npracticed in airport exercises.\nRecommendation 12.3: Ensure the incident command organization provides for close cooperation\nbetween police security operations and civilian operations functions to enable timely recovery.\nEmergency response and recovery, especially at an airport, require a whole-community approach.\nPublic safety and civilian emergency management and airport operations counterparts need to be\nfully cognizant of the operational concerns of the other and these concerns need to be blended into\nincident command objectives at the outset. Airport operations staff need to be fully embedded in the\nincident command structure and adequately represent strategies to facilitate airport recovery to the\nUnified Command. Collaboration between public safety and airport operations needs to include the\nidentification of mission-critical airport and airline personnel and their organized and safe passage.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 60 Observations and Recommendations\nObservation 13: Evacuation and Shelter-in-Place\nTerminal evacuations must be enabled by effective public communications, personnel trained to guide\nand assist evacuee behavior, and rapid mobilization of additional help to ensure public safety.\nNFPA 1600 Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs states,\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Protective actions for life safety include evacuation, shelter-in-place, and lockdown and depend upon\nthe nature and location of the threat or hazard.\u00e2\u20ac 9 From an incident management standpoint, triggering\nany of these protective actions initiates a continuum of care in which responsibility is not complete until\nthe people among the impacted population safely depart the airport property or are otherwise in secure\nhands. Implementing protective actions at an airport the size of LAX takes prior planning, coordination,\nand trained personnel to include those within the resident population. Airports are a particular\nchallenge in comparison to other large facilities in that most people, when the daily population is at its\npeak, are transients who do not know the airport well, if at all, and must be guided or even assisted in\nany directed or spontaneous evacuation.\nBackground\nOn November 1, 2013, as the assailant made his way down Terminal 3, TSA agents, passengers,\nconcessionaires, and airline staff fled in the general direction of the gate area, with some taking shelter\nin the terminal but most initiating a spontaneous evacuation out of the building. People exited the\nterminal by whatever means possible, some through emergency exits onto the AOA adjacent to the\nterminal and others back into the CTA. The evacuation of Terminal 3 also triggered the spontaneous\nevacuations of Terminals 1 and 2. Airfield bus operators transported the evacuees to the Tom Bradley\nInternational Terminal for temporary sheltering in accordance with the LAX Evacuation and\nRepopulation Plan. Others either loitered in the CTA or exited the airport on their own. Approximately\n4,500 passengers self-evacuated from Terminals 1, 2, and 3 and more than 20,000 passengers were\nsheltered in place on aircraft, and in terminals.\nThe evacuations of Terminal 1, 2, and 3, coupled with the initially uncertain circumstances surrounding\nthe emerging security threat, prompted LAWAPD officers to direct the people they encountered in other\nterminals to shelter in place until their safety could be assured. Other than those initial contacts by\nindividual officers, it is not evident that an actual airport-wide directive to shelter-in-place was issued.\nNor is it clear that if such a directive were issued, how and by whom it would be relayed. Some in LAWA\nmanagement believe that many passengers and airport workers did not necessarily shelter-in-place, but\nrather were simply taken to inaction based on a lack of information and the visual and audible cues from\nthe unfolding response across the CTA.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 61\nAnalysis\nThe spontaneous and unassisted evacuation of multiple terminals created cascading effects across the\nairport and complicated essential airport operations and incident management. The LAX Terminal\nEvacuation and Repopulation Plan details provisions for an uncontrolled (spontaneous) evacuation\nfollowing, or in conjunction with, a dangerous incident. However, airport operations, the ICP, and the\nLAWA ARCC/DOC were ill prepared to manage the near-simultaneous evacuation of multiple terminals\nand the balance of the CTA population sheltering-in-place.\nLAWA personnel who attempted to help manage the flood of evacuees were overwhelmed, too few in\nnumber, and had minimal guidance from the ARCC/DOC. It was also clear that most airport residents\nwere unfamiliar with the evacuation plan, were of limited assistance in guiding evacuees, and either\npreceded or evacuated right alongside the airline passengers. With a focus on the uncertain security\nsituation in Terminal 3, the extent of multi-terminal evacuations had not been fully communicated to\nthe ICP. Lack of an integrated airport-wide mass notification system hampered the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to\nprovide information and direction to evacuees and those sheltering-in-place.\nDay-to-day communications between the LAWA ARCC and the various terminals typically occurs through\na variety of channels, to include customer service representatives, airline station managers, and the TSA\nand CBP supervisors. While these channels suffice for relatively routine matters, they proved entirely\ninsufficient and undependable during the confusion of three terminal evacuations that occurred on\nNovember 1. Lack of dependable communications into the terminals and the limited presence of LAWA\nstaff on-scene hampered the ARCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and thus the DOC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, ability to provide broad situational awareness,\nnot only during these evacuations but also throughout the entire life-cycle of this incident.\nLAX terminal evacuation plans contain the basic concepts needed to facilitate evacuations, but fail to\nidentify and address key \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pinch-points\u00e2\u20ac such as a lack of integrated alerting and mass notification\ncapability and assumptions regarding mobilizing and organizing staff resources needed to marshal and\nsafeguard evacuees. Although initial marshaling of those who evacuated from the terminals onto the\nAOA was well executed with good inter-unit collaboration, those resources were quickly overwhelmed.\nThe DOC was too far removed and lacked sufficient situational awareness to influence events. Because\nthe ICP was preoccupied with the security situation, it too did not have either the situational awareness\nor the immediate ability to mobilize assets in response. Moreover, there was no clear understanding as\nto which of the two entities - the ICP or the ARCC/DOC - should have assumed operational control.\nAlthough it is preferred that terminal evacuations be guided by trained and knowledgeable LAWA\npersonnel, this is often impractical, especially in the case of a spontaneous evacuation. Instead,\nterminal residents must be trained in evacuation procedures and by their actions guide airport visitors.\nUsing Floor Wardens for this purpose is also recommended. Floor Wardens are resident volunteers\ntrained in marshaling and guiding fellow evacuees in the event of a fire or other emergency. During\ninterviews with LAWA staff, it became clear the airport Floor Warden program previously in place had\nfallen into disuse and associated training for airport residents had not been recently refreshed.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 62 Observations and Recommendations\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 13.1: Train LAWA and tenant personnel in shelter-in-place and evacuation\nprocedures to ensure the safety of evacuees, particularly those with disabilities or special needs.\nLAWA airport operations and emergency management leadership realized the gaps that exist in their\ncurrent evacuation plans and have already initiated improvement efforts accordingly. The Floor\nWarden program, which will identify and train volunteer resident personnel in each of the terminals to\nassist with the evacuation process, is being revitalized and a training schedule advanced. LAWA has\nalso formed a new program called the Airport Response Team (ART) consisting of LAWA staff\nvolunteers. These volunteers are trained to aid travelers and airport residents during emergencies\nand will provide information and comfort items. The ART program will also place significant emphasis\non assisting members of special needs populations.\nRecommendation 13.2: Support ongoing awareness of emergency evacuation and sheltering\nprocedures through a sustained information campaign to include public address announcements.\nMost people at the airport on any given day are travelers who do not know the airport environment\nwell, if at all, and who must be guided or even assisted in any directed or spontaneous evacuation.\nSignage, way-finding, and routine public messaging are important strategies to improve the readiness\nof the airport population for any potential emergency. LAWA, under sponsorship of the Airport\nEmergency Management Working Group (AEMWG), has designed a robust public awareness campaign\nthat leverages visual and audible cues to orient travelers to their environment and provide them with\nbasic personal safety information. Once implemented, the campaign will link to pre-scripted\nemergency public announcements in the terminals to provide travelers with specific directions to\nfollow in an emergency.\nRecommendation 13.3: Plan for rapid mobilization of LAWA police or civilian staff to any shelter-in-\nplace or evacuation location to enable safe containment or evacuee marshalling and transport.\nThe active shooter incident demonstrated the importance of maintaining the ability to mobilize LAWA\ncivilian employees as needed to assist with a variety of non-risky, though nonetheless important,\nemergency response related tasks. Depending on the extent of an emergency, the numbers could be\nsignificant and require careful planning and management. From providing aid to terminal evacuees to\nstaffing shelter-in-place locations, there are personnel requirements contained within the AEP and its\nassociated annexes that have yet to be fully assessed. As part of the capabilities gap analysis of the\nAEP annexes now under way, planning factors should be developed and used to guide the use of the\nLAX Terminal Evacuation and Repopulation Plan and other emergency response plans as appropriate.\nObservation 14: Transportation Services\nPre-planning and central management of transportation services within the ICS framework are vital to\nsupporting needs like evacuation, sheltering, movement of key personnel, and/or aircraft deplaning.\nCentrally managed transportation services, both for moving incident responders and mission-essential\nairport workers, are a critical resource during an incident. In an emergency, a range of vehicles may be\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 63\nrequired to carry out rescue operations, transport personnel, and haul supplies and debris. These\nservices should be organized and directed from a single point within the ICS structure to ensure unity of\ncommand and effort. When leveraged properly, transportation services can be a significant enabler to\naccomplishing key incident command objectives.\nBackground\nAt the onset of the active shooter incident on November 1, the ARCC Duty Manager and Airfield Bus\nOperations leveraged the use of LAWA buses to gather and transport displaced passengers and\nemployees from Terminals 1, 2, and 3 onto the AOA; provide a safety barrier from the danger of ongoing\nairfield operations; and transport them to a safe location away from the immediate incident. Buses\nwere used again later by incident command for the managed transportation of TSA personnel and other\nmission-essential tenant employees, from staging areas to the CTA, to help advance the reactivation of\nterminal operations as part of overall incident recovery. Buses were also used to transport passengers\nfrom the CTA area to Lot C where they could solicit off-site transportation through a variety of\ncommercial transportation operators.\nAnalysis\nThroughout the incident, there were challenges to incident management and ongoing airport operations\nthat were or could have been addressed by employing centrally managed transportation services. These\nincluded: passengers needing transportation to temporary shelter locations; deployment of police\nofficers from off-airport staging to support CTA security operations; movement of mission-essential\nairport workers to assist in airport recovery; and aircraft deplaning operations and subsequent\nmovement of passengers to the terminal area from airside parking ramps.\nThe tight security cordon placed around the airport made it difficult for civilian responders, LAWA staff,\nand mission-essential airport workers to gain access to the facility without the benefit of an arranged\nescort or some other form of managed and secure transportation. These personnel were important to\nresponse and recovery operations and their delay only served to worsen an already difficult situation for\nthose impacted on the airport. The inability to deploy civilian staff needed to support terminal and\naircraft operations hindered aircraft arrival and departure operations causing lengthy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hold on boards\u00e2\u20ac\nand tarmac delays. Consequently, about 20,000 people were either confined in terminals or on waiting\naircraft from 30 minutes up to 6 hours.\nAs described, LAWA did organize some transportation services during the incident. However, lack of a\nready plan, absence of pre-arranged agreements with transportation providers, and no central\nmanagement of transportation services from either the ICP or the LAWA DOC limited the options\navailable to employ transportation assets as a ready enabler to response and recovery operations. It\nappears that management of transportation requests was largely done through the DOC via its interface\nwith ground transportation services or coordination with the City EOC. A number of requests for support\nwere sent to both the ICP and the DOC, which led to duplication of effort. Lack of a process and a\ntransportation management function in the incident command structure meant that requests were not\nprioritized and were handled on a first-in / first-out basis. Lack of pre-identified staging areas, access\npoints, and travel routes further complicated the transportation management challenge.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 64 Observations and Recommendations\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 14.1: Account for organizing and managing transportation services in pre-event\nplanning and ensure proper inclusion of this activity within the ICS structure.\nTransportation services are an important consideration throughout the lifecycle of any emergency.\nLAWA should ensure that this consideration is appropriately recognized in the AEP and its associated\nannexes and that those plans include transportation management as a specific part of the incident\ncommand structure, both at the ICP and the LAWA DOC. Staging areas, access points and travel\nroutes should be outlined in the AEP annex dealing with incident command system facilities. Potential\ntransportation requirements should be evaluated as part of the capability gap analysis now underway\nand an inventory of the LAWA vehicle fleet should be kept in the ARCC/DOC.\nRecommendation 14.2: Negotiate agreements with other transportation agencies and commercial\nproviders to ensure these resources can be mobilized in an emergency to provide support.\nLAWA is encouraged to work with the City of Los Angeles Emergency Management Division as it\nconsiders its own emergency transportation management needs and leverages similar planning and\nstanding agreements already in place by that agency. This would include any existing agreements with\nthe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority for emergency bus service. LAWA\nroutinely interacts with numerous transportation providers on a daily basis and should consider\ndeveloping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on-call\u00e2\u20ac agreements with those providers to assist LAX if needed. Protocols for managing\ntransportation services should be described and associated authorities for triggering standing\ninteragency agreements or commercial contracts defined in the AEP.\nObservation 15: Passenger Assistance and Mass Care\nResponse plans must provide for mobilization of care for persons displaced by an emergency and with\nspecial needs, to include basic health and comfort, family reunification, and interim sheltering.\nU.S. DOT FAA Circular 150/5200-31C, Change 1 defines mass care as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the actions that are taken to\nprotect evacuees and other disaster victims from the effects of the disaster.\u00e2\u20ac 10 More importantly, it\nadvises airports that mass care activities include providing temporary shelter, food, medical care,\nclothing, and essential life support needs to those people who have been displaced in an emergency.\nAlthough the incident on November 1 was not of the extent that persons impacted required this level of\nsupport, it is also clear that people adversely affected by an airport incident of even modest duration\nmay require a minimum of comfort items that equate to good customer care, such as:\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Reasonable climate control\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Water\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Comfortable seating\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Male and female restrooms\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Charging stations for phones and electronic devices\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Assistance with luggage and belongings\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 65\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Actionable incident and flight information\nThe active shooter incident in Terminal 3 prompted the evacuation and/or displacement of thousands of\npassengers and the virtual confinement of thousands of others. As the incident unfolded, many of the\nevacuated passengers were transported to temporary holding areas, others were held on buses, and\nmost sheltered in place in aircraft, and other terminals. The LAX Terminal Evacuation and Repopulation\nPlan provides guidance for the care of displaced passengers and others affected by an incident, and that\nplan was executed on November 1. That plan was not sufficient to address the airport-wide passenger\nassistance or mass care needs experienced on November 1.\nBackground\nAlthough a lack of access to the airport due to the security cordon hampered some efforts at passenger\nassistance, at LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request, the American Red Cross (ARC) delivered over 5,000 bottles of water,\nmeals and snacks, cots, and personal hygiene kits to people in the terminals. In addition, a number of\nairlines provided whatever water and snacks were on hand. At the height of the incident, efforts were\nalso made by airport operations and LAFD to distribute water to people around the CTA. The DOC\nactivated a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Reliant Immediate Care, a 24/7 urgent care\nclinic in the vicinity of the airport to address medical needs. Reliant was already serving as an ad hoc\nholding area for senior citizens and persons with disabilities until terminal repopulation began. Reliant\nprovided food and water, filled prescriptions, and monitored the medical condition of evacuees. In TBIT,\n20 Reliant attendants were on duty and worked continuously for about 10 hours providing\nindividualized support, including addressing the needs of about 100 people confined to wheelchairs.\nIn accordance with the LAX Evacuation and Repopulation Plan, Parking Lot C was identified as a staging\narea and as a location for the reunification of passengers with local contacts or who could otherwise\narrange for their own transportation off the airport. Initially, there were no shelter or passenger care\namenities at that location, but by the afternoon, some food, water, and portable toilets were provided.\nAirport operations staff at Parking Lot C also provided evacuees with information concerning rental car\noperators, hotels, and taxis. As a result, many passengers were able to arrange for their own\ntransportation and lodging if needed. Another 70 to 100 passengers remained in Parking Lot C until\nterminal operations were reestablished and they could continue on to their travel destinations.\nAnticipating the need for overnight sheltering, the DOC coordinated with the City of Los Angeles\nEmergency Management Division\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EOC to procure shelters for a possible 300-400 displaced passengers.\nBy midafternoon on the day of the incident, two shelter sites were activated off of airport property: the\nWestchester Recreation Center at 7000 West Manchester Avenue (3 miles from LAX) and the Westwood\nRecreation Center at 1350 South Sepulveda Boulevard (12 miles from LAX). Later that evening, as the\nincident stabilized and needs for overnight facilities were better assessed, the DOC informed the City of\nLos Angeles EOC that the mass sheltering centers were not needed.\nAnalysis\nThe events of November 1 demonstrated that there are some important gaps in the LAX Terminal\nEvacuation and Repopulation Plan. Those include the need to anticipate and support simultaneous\nevacuation of multiple terminals, coupled with the potential for the shelter-in-place of passengers and\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 66 Observations and Recommendations\nairport workers across the entire CTA for an extended period. The plan also did not sufficiently address\nincident command and control, nor did it adequately identify the personnel and logistics support\nneeded to manage related customer care operations. Most importantly, there was some confusion over\nwhich entity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ICP or the DOC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should have provided operational control over incident-related\npassenger assistance and mass care activities. Given these factors, there were shortfalls in providing\nneeded passenger assistance and mass care support to those impacted by the emergency.\nIt appears that passenger assistance and mass care objectives were never fully integrated into incident\nobjectives at the ICP or the DOC, nor were the incident command structures at either entity built-out\nsufficiently to address the management of these activities. Lacking full situational awareness, the ICP\nwas not able to appreciate the magnitude of passenger assistance and mass care challenge. Having\nslightly better awareness than the ICP, the DOC recognized these emerging requirements, but having\ncontrol over few operational assets, was unable to provide the staff and resources needed to fully\naddress them. Although the DOC arranged sheltering, of the thousands of passengers transported to\nthe TBIT, only 33 stated a need for overnight sheltering. Rather than transport this small number to a\nshelter off airport grounds, airport operations staff at TBIT worked with the DOC to arrange for cots,\nfood, water, and hygiene kits. The ARC delivered these items to the TBIT Special Events Lounge where\nthese people spent the night.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 15.1: Conduct joint planning with the Red Cross to assess potential needs and\ndevelop strategies for delivering passenger assistance and mass care under a range of scenarios.\nPassenger assistance and mass care requirements can vary from minor comfort items to overnight\nlodging to specialized assistance for the functional and access needs populations. To best determine\nthese requirements across a variety of emergency scenarios, it is recommended that LAWA partner in\nits planning with the ARC. Responding to more than 70,000 disasters across the country every year,\nno organization better understands providing mass care better than the ARC. LAWA should also\nconsult with the City of Los Angeles Department on Disability and the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Emergency Management\nDepartment for additional advice and to harmonize planning efforts. It is further suggested that the\nLAX Terminal Evacuation and Repopulation Plan be retitled, revised, and expanded to encompass a\nbroader focus on general passenger assistance and mass care concerns.\nRecommendation 15.2: Estimate logistics requirements related to providing passenger assistance\nand mass care support and decide on the best ways to ensure immediate access to those resources.\nConcurrent with the planning work recommended above, LAWA should assess the logistics associated\nwith providing passenger assistance and mass care services to passengers and airport employees in\nthe event of an extended emergency. The needs generated by the November 1, 2013 incident should\nbe considered as a baseline for that analysis. Once those needs are determined, LAWA should decide\nwhat resources must be kept on-hand, what resources should be procured as needed, and what\nresources can be readily obtained with the help of the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Emergency Management Department.\nProtocols for managing passenger assistance and mass care resources and the associated authorities\nfor triggering procurement of additional resources should be defined in the AEP.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 67\nRecommendation 15.3: Update existing plans and conduct training as required to provide effective\npassenger assistance and mass care to access and functional needs populations in an emergency.\nLAWA has a well-established program to address the requirements of the access and functional needs\npopulations at its airports and these issues are clearly a priority for airport management. Federal and\nState laws require that children and adults with disabilities have equal opportunity to access\nemergency programs and services. LAWA has been very proactive in integrating access and functional\nneeds requirements into its revision of the AEP and the development of new AEP annexes. Given the\nchallenges associated with the general delivery of passenger assistance and mass care cited above,\nsome needs on November 1 may have gone unmet. However, on that day, the LAWA Coordinator for\nDisabled Services in concert with the City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department on Disability worked tirelessly with the ICP\nand DOC to address access and functional needs concerns and search out and assist members of those\npopulations where they could. The lessons learned from that experience should be factored into\nfuture planning, training, and exercises.\nObservation 16: Security Clearing Operations\nConducting wide-area security operations requires careful planning, organization, and harmonization\nwith civilian counterparts to both ensure public safety and speed facility repopulation and recovery.\nOn the day of the active shooter incident, security-clearing operations were initiated immediately\nfollowing the apprehension of the shooting suspect and continued until the mid-afternoon. The whole\ntime, the incident command team placed considerable emphasis on two distinct priorities: 1) protecting\nthe people at the airport from any further security threat; and 2) verifying the general safety of the\nairport to facilitate restoration of operations as quickly as the security situation would allow.\nConducting security operations to sweep and verify the safety of CTA was no small task. The airport\ncomplex spans more than 3,425 acres. Within that area, the CTA contains nine passenger terminals\nconnected in a U-shape. It has parking structures at its core that are ringed by a two-level roadway\ndividing arrival and departure activities at the terminal frontages. The parking structures within the CTA\ncontain nearly 8,000 parking stalls. In addition to the CTA parking area, LAX has a capacity of over 4,500\nparking stalls in an economy lot outside the CTA. All of the terminals and parking structures in the CTA\nhad to be swept by police with explosive detection K-9 teams before the all-clear could be sounded.\nThat call was made at about 2:30 PM, five hours after the shooting.\nBackground\nWithin the operations section of the UC, a special operations group was established and organized to\nconduct CTA security clearing operations. These clearing operations occurred in two distinct segments:\nclearing areas directly associated with the shooting and the securing of Terminal 3; and the subsequent\nactions to ensure that the entire terminal area was safe and could be readied for reactivation and\nrepopulation. As the shooting scene was secured, LAWAPD and LAPD commanders worked together to\nassemble and deploy strike teams to search Terminal 3 for additional shooters, possible Improvised\nExplosive Devices (IEDs), and survivors who had not evacuated the terminal.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 68 Observations and Recommendations\nPolice teams cleared passengers, concessionaires, and LAWA employees who had taken shelter in\nTerminal 3 restrooms, restaurants, stores, and gate areas. They also found and immediately extricated\nseveral shooting victims and directed other passengers to temporary holding locations. Terminal 3 was\nfully cleared by 10:00 AM, one half hour after the initial shooting. At that time, the terminal was\nsecured for law enforcement-only access to preserve the crime scene and facilitate the investigation.\nWith Terminal 3 fully secured, emphasis transitioned to clearing operations across the rest of the CTA.\nAs fresh police resources arrived, they were paired with LAWAPD officers in additional strike teams and\ndispatched to conduct clearing operations across the other terminals and parking structures.\nAs the incident unfolded, sporadic reports of potential suspects, suspicious behavior, and possible IEDs\nall required immediate police response and resolution. These calls only added to the challenge of the\ndeliberate and painstaking sweep and clearing operations being conducted for each terminal and\nparking structure. The latter included the simultaneous search for the vehicle in which the suspect\narrived and its driver whose whereabouts were for a time still unknown. As evidence of the concern for\npotential IEDs, police strike teams included 27 K-9 units from various agencies which were essential to\nclearing luggage left behind by passengers who self-evacuated from Terminals 1, 2, and 3. Security\nclearing operations were completed, and all terminals and parking structures (with the exception of\nTerminal 3) were reopened by late afternoon on November 1, 2013.\nAnalysis\nWhile security sweeps were executed by police teams with tremendous diligence, the full scope and\ncomplexity of the operation was beyond initial estimation and clearing operations took longer than\ninitially thought. None of the agencies involved had ever had to sweep and clear such an enormous\nfacility, most of it still heavily populated with passengers and airport workers. This was done while also\ncautiously searching for what could have been additional armed threats or explosives. Adding to the\nchallenges of scope and complexity, the ICP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s control of clearing operations underway were hampered\nby several additional factors. These included: 1) the less than full build-out of incident command\nstructure to include a robust planning section; 2) a lack of interoperable radio communications to\nfacilitate coordination with non-LAWAPD police teams and resources; and 3) gaps in ICP situational\nawareness of the status of ongoing clearing operations.\nPlanning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There are two areas of focus for a planning section in the incident command structure.\nOne is to monitor the evolving situation and help the incident command team maintain situational\nawareness as needed to exercise command and control. The other is to look forward into the next\noperational period, and based on the incident commander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intent, to formulate an IAP. That plan\nshould define objectives, how those will be achieved, and the command structure needed. Although a\nplanning section was established, the dynamic nature of ICP activity and the absence of additional\nstaff with the right training and experience prevented the planning section from fully supporting the\norganization of the clearing operation and monitoring its progress.\nCommunications \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The ICP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to monitor clearing operations was handicapped by the lack of\nboth interoperable radio communications and an incident communications plan as part of the IAP.\nEffective communications are essential to situational awareness and, in this case, the lack thereof\nmade it challenging for the ICP to coordinate clearing operations across multiple agencies, track what\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 69\nwas cleared and what remained, and to redirect assets as needed. Some teams had been ordered to\nsearch different areas by different supervisors and in other cases teams were ordered to search the\nsame areas multiple times. These conditions made it difficult to predict when clearing operations\nwould be completed and in turn delayed the restoration of terminal operations.\nDespite the challenges involved, security clearing of the CTA was a substantial accomplishment by all of\nthe police agencies involved. It was a unique demonstration of highly collaborative police operations\norganized and conducted in a very compressed time frame. The lessons learned should be documented\nby LAWAPD and offered for study by other police agencies that are concerned about similar threats.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 16.1: Document the CTA security clearing operation, develop planning factors for\nestimating resources and time to complete clearing tasks, and apply these to future incident planning.\nThe CTA clearing operation conducted on November 1 provides LAWAPD with a set of valuable planning\nfactors that can now be used as a baseline for any future response of a similar nature. For example, it is\nnow known how many officers, organized into how many teams, and with what resources, are needed\nto clear individual terminals and the entire CTA in what time. With that information, more accurate\nestimates of both time and labor can be calculated and better predictions provided for a return to\nnormalcy as a way to facilitate parallel planning for the recovery of airport operations. These planning\nfactors might also be used to strategize how to evolve clearing operations in stages, and by closer\ncoordination with airport operations, advance a more rapid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rolling recovery\u00e2\u20ac of the CTA.\nRecommendation 16.2: Develop tools and methods to facilitate tactical planning, track the progress\nof operations, and share situational awareness to strengthen coordination among those involved.\nDeveloping situational awareness and managing tactical operations at the ICP on November 1 would\nhave greatly benefited from a set of simple tools and methods to support overall command and\ncontrol. These tools should be used to orient responders to the airport layout, record the status and\nemerging details of the incident, and depict deployment of resources in a way that would provide all\ninvolved within a unified picture of the situation. Tools such as command boards, schematics of\nterminal footprints, and map overlays all tailored and prepackaged for easy use in the field can go a\nlong way to making the ICP more effective. Ready duplicates of some of these tools for use by\ncounterparts from other agencies would help ensure all are literally on the same page. Compatible\napproaches would also improve the ICP /DOC interface and the more structured exchange of incident\nrelated information to the advantage of both.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 70 Observations and Recommendations\nObservation 17: Transition to and Hand-off for Recovery\nRecovery objectives must be addressed as early as possible in incident planning to ensure effective\nsynchronization of public safety requirements with the time-phased resumption of facility operations.\nIt is a basic principle that planning for disaster recovery must begin early in the response phase and be\nbased on assumptions prepared during pre-disaster preparedness efforts. For that reason, recovery\nobjectives are normally included in the IAP initially developed to guide response operations. This is so\nall responding members understand that, beyond the priority of saving lives and attending to the needs\nof survivors, the ultimate goal is a return to normalcy as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible.\nActions taken in the response phase can have major influence on the pace and direction of recovery. On\nNovember 1, 2013, a lack of readiness and differences in perception of role, between police and airport\noperations and between the ICP and the LAWA DOC, served to slow response planning and the\nsynchronization of effort needed for a more speedy recovery. Once recovery began, the ICP did not shift\nits focus and there was not a transfer of command that would permit airport operations to capitalize on\nthe structure and resources in place.\nBackground\nWhether at the ICP or at the DOC, the planning section plays a key role in leading the IAP process by\nidentifying barriers, examining possible courses of action, and drafting suggested incident objectives\nbased on information gathered and synthesized by the section\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s situation unit. Objectives are updated\nfor each subsequent operational period, which is normally 12 hours but could be shorter or longer\ndepending on the nature of the emergency. In the development of recovery objectives, there must be a\nsymbiotic relationship between the planning section in the ICP and the planning section in the DOC so\nthe perspectives of both entities are harmonized and integrated to achieve unity of purpose across the\nincident command structure. It matters little if early recovery planning is primarily accomplished in one\nplace or the other, just so long as it is accomplished and recovery objectives are effectively synchronized\nin an integrated IAP at both levels.\nOn November 1, airport operations representatives assigned to the ICP provided subject matter\nexpertise and served as primary points of contact between the ICP and DOC. These individuals made\nliaison with the DOC within the first hour, exchanged critical incident information, and made ongoing\nefforts to bridge the operations of two entities. The airport operations representatives at the ICP\nfocused on passenger care, terminal repopulation, and airport recovery issues and noted that recovery\nobjectives were discussed during the first ICP planning meeting, which occurred within 30-45 minutes of\nthe shooting. The DOC similarly held planning meetings to identify priorities and establish incident\nobjectives complementary to those of the ICP.\nWhile CTA security clearing operations were still being conducted, airport operations personnel in the\nICP worked directly with the DOC to establish LAWA-staffed Terminal Incident Recovery Centers (TIRCs)\nin Terminals 1 and 2 and the TBIT. Once the police signaled that the security clearing of the CTA was\nconcluded and the all-clear was given, the CTA roadways were reopened to commercial traffic at\napproximately 2:30 PM. Airport workers and flight crews were then allowed entrance and the\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 71\nrepopulation of Terminals 1 and 2 began. By 6:30 PM, all terminals (except Terminal 3) were functional.\nThe recovery and repopulation of Terminal 3 occurred on the morning of November 2.\nAnalysis\nThe planning sections in both the ICP and the DOC were not fully developed and lacked trained and\nexperienced planning staff. As a result, neither entity developed much in the way of an IAP beyond\nincident objectives. Moreover, routine contact between the ICP and the DOC was accomplished through\nairport operations personnel at the ICP and not between the respective planning sections or command\nstaff. Although the ICP structure was not fully built-out, it at least had the benefit of senior leadership.\nThe DOC not only lacked sufficiently trained staff, but also had no senior leadership from the response\norganizations integrated into the command and general staff positions within its structure.\nThe LAWAPD incident commander stated that he had no direct communication with the DOC manager\nthroughout the entire incident and had little awareness as to what the DOC was doing. The DOC\nmanager stated that he likewise had little knowledge of what the ICP was doing, except for what was\nbeing relayed to him from the airport operations liaisons on-scene. In this environment, there was little\ncapacity or opportunity to develop robust and unified recovery objectives, embed them within an\nintegrated IAP, and synchronize CTA security clearing operations and terminal recovery and\nrepopulation efforts. Had there been more executive-level representation from the responding\norganizations, especially police, in the DOC and had the DOC and ICP planning sections been better\nstaffed, there would have likely been a more seamless and timely recovery.\nAs security operations largely concluded at approximately 2:30 PM when the CTA roadway was\nreopened, the center of gravity of the incident shifted more fully in the direction of recovery. However,\nthe ICP did not then redirect its energy toward facilitating the recovery effort, which went on largely\noutside its purview. Nor was there a transfer of incident command to airport operations for that\npurpose. Instead, with the level of the crisis greatly diminished, the ICP gradually dissolved.\nAlthough efforts were made by the DOC and airport operations staff to implement TIRCs to smooth the\nway for terminal recovery, LAWA civilian staff assigned as TIRC leaders were inundated with unrelated\nrecovery tasks that pulled them away from their TIRC and its purpose. As a result, the TIRC effort was\nnot well supported and met with minimal success in the opinion of those staff. Had the ICP shifted its\nfocus to managing recovery and had authority been transferred to airport operations, the structure and\nresources of the incident command team may have been applied to supporting the TIRC mission and\nfacilitating other remaining recovery activities.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 17.1: Establish a recovery planning focus within the planning section of the DOC\nto think ahead and assess the impacts, anticipate requirements, and do early planning for recovery.\nThe planning section is a powerful tool at the disposal of incident command leadership, whether at\nthe ICP or in the operations center. The planning section has the freedom to stay somewhat detached\nfrom the immediate crisis and focus on the future by anticipating requirements, identifying possible\nchallenges, formulating incident objectives, and developing courses of action for consideration and\nimplementation. As recovery planning at the ICP may often be impractical, the LAWA DOC should take\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 72 Observations and Recommendations\nup this activity in an emergency. Consideration should be given to the subject matter expertise that\nmay be needed to facilitate recovery planning and the Planning Section Chief should be prepared to\ncall on variety of disciplines for assistance, such as operations, customer service, engineering,\nmaintenance, information technology, ground transportation, and any others as required.\nRecommendation 17.2: Incorporate robust recovery objectives in the Incident Action Plan early in\nthe response and plan for transition to recovery, to include the transfer of incident command as\nneeded.\nRegardless as to where recovery planning is performed, there should be a strong and ongoing\nconnection between the ICP and the DOC to ensure recovery objectives are synchronized with\nresponse operations and are firmly embedded into the IAP and an early stage. This helps the incident\ncommand better anticipate the transition to recovery and ensure that there is no loss of momentum\nin the return to normalcy. As the transition to recovery approaches, consideration should also be\ngiven to the possible need to implement a transfer of command. The idea here is to maintain the\nincident command structure and resources established for the response as a way to bridge into\nrecovery and allow the best-qualified person (or team of people) to assume responsibility.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 73\nEmergency Preparedness\nSimilar to the discussion of Public Safety issues and implications for overall security at LAX, a review of\nthe active shooter incident of November 1, 2013 provides a lens through which to consider the general\nadministration of the LAWA emergency management program. Like security, there is no single model\nfor an emergency management program that can be uniformly applied. Each program must be tailored\nto suit the nature of the entity it serves, the profile of risks that entity is likely to confront, and the\nmission, authorities, responsibilities, structure, and resources of its parent organization. There are,\nhowever, well-established and nationally recognized standards to gauge the maturity and guide the\ndevelopment of any program. This section applies elements of a few of those standards to the LAWA\nemergency management program to identify possible opportunities for improvement. Many of the\nissues outlined throughout this report have their roots in the current state of maturity of that program.\nLAWA Emergency Management Division\nThe LAWA Emergency Management Division reports to the Office of the Deputy Executive Director for\nOperations and Emergency Management, who in turn reports to the Executive Director. That placement\nprovides the Executive Director with visibility over emergency management programs at the same level\nof oversight as that of Airport Police and other major components of the organization. The Director for\nEmergency Management has two units reporting to him. One is the Training unit, which includes all\ntraining for operations personnel at LAWA. The other is the Emergency Management unit, which\ncurrently has four fulltime positions in its structure two of which are vacant. The four fulltime positions\ndo not include the Director of the unit.\nThe stated mission of the LAWA Emergency Management unit is: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Developing excellence in emergency\nmanagement through preparedness, mitigation, response, recovery, and partnerships in the unique\nregional and global environment of aviation.\u00e2\u20ac While preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery\nare typical core functions of emergency management, the reference to partnerships signifies the reality\nthat, perhaps more than most programs, emergency management is a responsibility that is shared\nacross the LAWA enterprise. It is also dependent on the participation and contributions of public safety\nagencies and private sector stakeholders both resident at LAWA airports and elsewhere in the region.\nOriginally set within LAWA Airport Operations, after September 11, 2001, the emergency management\nfunction was transferred to LAWAPD and following a later reorganization was transferred back to\nOperations in 2009. It has since had a succession of leadership on almost a two-year cycle. However, in\nJune 2011, LAWA implemented reforms and has made steady progress in improving stewardship of the\nprogram, training, and the development of a suite of new response plans. Given a revitalization effort\njust begun in late 2011, it is still in the early stages of its maturity. With consistent executive support\nand investment of essential financial and staff resources, it is on a path to achieving full capability. The\nprudent use of national standards and best practices can point the way toward continued improvement.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 74 Observations and Recommendations\nNational Standards and Best Practices\nThere are three primary sources of information to consider in assessing the state of maturity of the\nLAWA emergency management program. The first is policy guidance from FEMA on the execution of\nemergency management functions to include the NPS and NIMS. In addition, the two nationally\nrecognized standards for the administration of emergency management programs are: the National Fire\nProtection Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NFPA 1600 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Standard on Disaster/ Emergency Management and Business\nContinuity Programs; and the Emergency Management Accreditation Program (EMAP).\nFEMA National Guidance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The NPS establishes the basic process model for preparedness: assessing\nrisk; building and sustaining capabilities; planning and training; validating plans through exercises and\nactual events. The NPS was established to harmonize preparedness planning across jurisdictions to\nfoster better whole-community integration. NIMS provides a single consistent nationwide approach\nto the actual management of emergencies. Like the NPS, NIMS fosters collaboration across agencies\nas essential to an effective disaster response, regardless of the nature, size, or complexity of the\nevent. The NIMS is applicable at all levels of government and across all functional disciplines. At the\ncore of NIMS is the ICS, which is addressed in previous sections of this report.\nNFPA 1600 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c NFPA 1600 was first introduced in 1995 and has been updated to reflect the latest best\npractice in the organization and administration of both emergency management and business\ncontinuity programs. It has also been adopted as one of three standards approved under the FEMA\nPrivate Sector Preparedness Accreditation Program (PS-Prep). The most recent edition of NFPA 1600\nincludes contributions from FEMA, the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA), the\nInternational Association of Emergency Managers (IAEM), the Association of Contingency Planners,\nand the Disaster Recovery Institute International. NFPA-1600 takes a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153total approach\u00e2\u20ac to common\nprogram elements, techniques, and processes to include management, planning, implementation,\ntraining and exercises, and program maintenance and improvement.11\nEMAP \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The EMAP standard is an accreditation process focused at local and state emergency\nmanagement programs. Applicants engage in self-critique and incremental improvement typically\nculminating in a formal assessment by EMAP evaluators. The process is voluntary, scalable, and can\nbe applied by any public sector organization, whether seeking accreditation or not. Given that the\nstandard represents nationally recognized minimum performance criteria, it can also be applied as a\ntool for strategic improvement in the administration of emergency management programs. EMAP has\nbeen approved by the American National Standards Institute and endorsed by NEMA, IAEM, the\nCouncil of State Governments, and the National Association of Counties. EMAP criteria fall into two\nbroad categories. The first deals with program management, emphasizing general administration,\ncoordination, and stakeholder involvement. The second spans criteria in fifteen different aspects of\nemergency management, ranging from risk assessment through crisis communications.12\nNot all of the guidance in the resources outlined above will apply or map perfectly to the LAWA\nemergency management program. Nonetheless, taken together, they do provide a benchmark from\nwhich to consider the current level of performance and program maturity and suggest areas needing\ndevelopment, support, and/or additional improvement.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 75\nObservation 18: Governance and Administration\nThe Emergency Management Division must have a clear charter, be empowered to drive cross-cutting\nprograms, be resourced sufficiently to fulfill its mission, and be in a state of continuous improvement.\nLAWA began a deliberate effort to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reset\u00e2\u20ac its emergency management program in late 2011. The\nagency implemented basic ICS training, acquired consultant assistance to develop an expanded suite of\nemergency response plans, and hired new leadership to better organize the program and advance the\nreforms already begun. Although reform is still in its early stages and will take time to mature, the\nobservations on emergency management operations contained in the previous sections of this report\nsuggest that there are both strengths and weaknesses in the program that should be further explored.\nGaps in response capabilities evident during the active shooter incident of November 1, 2013 have a\ndirect link to effectiveness of the overall emergency management program and its governance.\nBackground\nEmergency management is both a professional discipline and crosscutting program. As professionals in\nthe discipline, emergency managers fill a unique role among their public safety counterparts in police,\nfire fighting, and emergency medical services in that they typically do not have direct control over the\nresources (e.g., public safety or public works) that are essential in responding to a crisis. In fact, the\nword \u00e2\u20ac\u0153management\u00e2\u20ac is a misnomer as it implies control when the emergency manager largely facilitates\nthe activities of the other disciplines. FEMA defines the role as that of a leader who is also an alliance\nbuilder, communicator, planner, administrator, coordinator, educator, and problem solver.\nNFPA 1600 describes emergency management as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an ongoing process to prevent, mitigate, prepare for,\nrespond to, maintain continuity during, and to recover from, an incident that threatens life, property,\noperations, or the environment.\u00e2\u20ac The EMAP standard defines emergency management more broadly as\nproviding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the coordination of prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery activities for\nall hazards and that encompasses all organizations, agencies, departments, and individuals having\nresponsibilities for these activities.\u00e2\u20ac Emergency management is thus a cross-cutting program that sets\nthe framework for coordinated multi-agency preparedness, response, and recovery operations. A few\nof these will be performed by the emergency management organization itself while the majority will be\nperformed by others. To establish this framework, emergency management must have the mandate,\ntrained people, essential resources, and the plans, policies, and procedures needed to fulfill its mission.\nTwo key elements of effective emergency management are governance and administration.\nGovernance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Both NFPA 1600 and the EMAP standard address the topics of program charter,\nexecutive support, and program leadership in slightly different though consistent ways. Those are\nadapted here under the heading of governance. The most fundamental requirement for governance\nis a clear statement of corporate policy for the emergency management program. That statement\nmust provide emphatic and unambiguous guidance to all members of the larger organization\nconcerning the importance of the program, its vision and mission, and the roles, responsibilities, and\nauthorities of its members, not just the emergency management function alone. There must also be\nan emergency management director who is placed high enough in the structure to wield suitable\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 76 Observations and Recommendations\nauthority and has the visible support of executive leadership. With that support, the director must\nbe empowered to work with and obtain cooperation from across the rest of the organization.\nAdministration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Given the crosscutting nature of the program, an emergency management director\nshould be assisted in its administration by an advisory committee made up of key stakeholders. That\ncommittee would provide input and/or assist in preparing, developing, implementing, evaluating, and\nmaintaining the program. A multi-year plan that defines goals, objectives, and costs for the program\nshould be prepared through coordinating with these stakeholders. This collaboration is essential to\nwinning management support for the personnel and financial resources needed to mitigate the risk\nof those threats and hazards the organization has identified of most concern.\nNFPA 1600 and EMAP address the need to take a risk-based approach to advancing emergency\nmanagement programs and likewise stress the need to implement a process of continuous review\nand improvement in the programs themselves. Consistent with the basic concepts outlined in the\nNPS, emergency management programs should be guided by a cyclical assessment of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all-hazard\u00e2\u20ac\nrisks to the entity or jurisdiction its serves to drive its preparedness, mitigation, response, and\nrecovery planning efforts. This will in turn drive plans for its own development and renewal.\nAdministration of these programs should thus include methods to regularly evaluate its policies,\nplans, procedures, and capabilities. Those evaluations should be conducted on a regular basis and/or\nwhen a risk assessment is performed or real-world events suggest review is needed. An ongoing\nprocess for tracking the implementation of improvement actions is therefore also required.\nAnalysis\nMaturation of any emergency management program takes time, often many years. It requires\ndedicated executive attention, precious resources, and participation of many players from across a\nlocale, all who have other fulltime responsibilities. Some of the most significant players are in the\nuniformed public safety agencies or other departments where competition and organizational culture\ncan interfere with getting cooperation. Once organized, emergency management programs take much\npersistence to maintain. Leaders come and go, priorities change, and even well-established programs\ncan decline and falter. The LAWA Emergency Management Division should be viewed as being on the\nearly part of its maturity curve. It is incumbent upon LAWA to respond to the experience of November 1\nas an important opportunity to fuel its steady climb up that curve.\nMission and Mandate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The mission of the LAWA emergency management program is not well-\ndefined or widely understood across the agency, or perhaps even respected by the stakeholders it\nmust engage with and from whom it must win support and cooperation. While there was a launch\nmemo issued to LAWA staff and external agency participants, it was not robust enough or sufficiently\ndirective to clearly define what the emergency management program is, state why it is important, or\noutline the roles, responsibilities and authorities of either the Emergency Management Division or\nother leaders and functions across the organization that are key to its implementation. There has also\nbeen some resistance to program initiatives within the organization. Cooperation and progress has\nbeen largely achieved through force of will by the Deputy Executive Director for Operations and\nEmergency Management and the Director of Emergency Management, who are strongly committed to\nthe success of the program.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 77\nResources \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The LAWA Emergency Management Division does not appear to be appropriately\norganized, sufficiently staffed, or adequately resourced to fulfill the responsibilities associated with\nadministering a comprehensive emergency management program at a major international airport.\nNor does it seem to fully integrate with and benefit from the expertise, capabilities, and resources of\nthe Los Angeles Emergency Management Division. LAWA emergency management staff, already too\nfew in number, lack the training and depth of professional experience necessary to perform essential\nresponsibilities, thus creating an overreliance on outside consultants. Though its people should be an\nessential integrating element of any major crisis, the LAWA Emergency Management Division also\ndoes not have the vehicles, communications equipment, or other associated tools necessary to enable\nit to respond rapidly, maintain situational awareness, and play a meaningful coordinating role.\nProgram Management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c To its credit, LAWA has in place two inter-disciplinary advisory committees:\nThe Airport Emergency Management Committee (AEMC) and the Airport Emergency Management\nWorking Group (AEMWG). The AEMC consists of senior executives and public safety officials and\nprovides general direction for various initiatives being advanced by either the LAWA Emergency\nManagement Division or the AEMWG. The AEMWG has broader participation and consists of working-\nlevel staff and subcommittees. These committees have helped to advance LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comprehensive\nresponse planning effort and are already working on improvement actions from the November 1\nactive shooter incident. Unfortunately, this work is being accomplished without benefit of an overall\nprogram management plan or associated goals, objectives, and performance metrics.\nProgram Development \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Without firmly establishing a mission, vision, and management plan, LAWA\nmay expend considerable effort and expense though still not achieve an emergency management\nprogram that effectively develops and integrates the crosscutting capabilities needed to effectively\nrespond to a major crisis. Conversations with LAWA staff and review of various planning documents\nand staff briefings indicate that during the last two years, LAWA made a significant good faith effort to\ntrain staff in basic incident command practices as a way to inculcate an emergency management\nmindset into the broader organization. Following that training, it hired a consultant to conduct a very\ncomprehensive response planning initiative to develop 19 annexes to its base Airport Emergency Plan\n(AEP). However, while the AEP, which is mandated by the FAA, was also recently revised, that effort\nwas completed without the same rigor as the annexes. Staff regarded the AEP as simply a regulatory\nrequirement and anticipated the annexes would be the primary reference.\nSpanning two years, work to develop the suite of annexes to the AEP consumed an inordinate amount\nof staff time and attention across the entire organization. Given the diversity of stakeholders across\nthe Los Angeles area and the potential for a variety of competing perspectives on airport emergency\nmanagement, the consultant was asked to create a framework for annex development that reflected\nthat diversity. The effort to reach consensuses from and the committed participation of more than 15\ndifferent agencies took considerable time and effort on the part of LAWA staff. This appears to have\nbeen at the expense of the more deliberate and systematic development of the other fundamental\nbuilding blocks of a sound emergency management program, such as those outlined in the NFPA 1600\nand EMAP Standard. Although both the training and annex development work are important aspects\nof the program, the lack of a policy statement, management plan, and the right number of people\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 78 Observations and Recommendations\nwith the requisite skills and resources hampers a more logical process of program development. Even\nthough tabletop exercises were conducted to validate the plans with the planning team, as of\nNovember 1, incident command capability to implement those plans had not been fully tested in an\nexercise and the harmonious interagency relationships so vital to effective disaster response were not\nrefined. A bad plan implemented well is far better than a perfect plan not implemented at all. While\nthe LAWA Emergency Management team suggested interim AEMC adoption followed by capability\nanalysis and drills, a few members of the AEMC insisted on further analysis and refinement prior to\nfinal annex adoption. This has significantly slowed the process.\nAs demonstrated by the observations made in previous sections of this report, despite laudable efforts\nexpended in base-line training of staff and AEP and annex development, there are still opportunities to\nimprove areas such as incident command operations, resource management, interoperable\ncommunications, ARCC/DOC functioning, and public alert and warning. The need to address these core\nfunctions of emergency management would seem to indicate that LAWA may need to realign priorities\nto adopt a more long-term and deliberate approach. That will require a multi-year plan, the continued\ndedication of resources, and the patience to recognize that it all can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be done at once.\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 18.1: Issue a strong policy statement that formally establishes the emergency\nmanagement program, key roles and responsibilities, and the structure of program governance.\nAlthough the LAWA emergency management program enjoys strong support from executive\nleadership, the program\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s importance may not in all cases be well understood or fully respected by\nthose in the organization who must contribute time and resources in a collaborative effort to achieve\nits aims. A strong statement of executive policy must be issued that clearly articulates its importance,\nthe mission and vision of the program, and the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of those key to\nits success.\nRecommendation 18.2: Prepare a plan to guide emergency management program development,\nobtain broad consensus on its objectives, priorities, metrics, and funding needs, and implement.\nLAWA should organize a subcommittee of the AEMC to review the current maturity of the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nemergency management program. The subcommittee should use NFPA 1600 and the EMAP standard,\nas well as lessons learned from the November 1 incident, as guides. LAWA should also benchmark\nbest practices from other airport emergency management programs and in so doing establish a\nnetwork of experts for continued professional exchange. In line with the policy statement and the\nresults of the review and benchmarking cited above, LAWA should develop and obtain broad\nconsensus on a multi-year management plan and budget to guide staged long-term development of\nthe program.\nRecommendation 18.3: Ensure the Emergency Management Division is staffed and resourced, and\nhas the proficiency needed to execute both its day-to-day role and perform in crisis situations.\nA staffing study and job analysis should be performed to assess the LAWA Emergency Management\nDivision relative to its mission, core functions, and workload. This must include development of job\ndescriptions and performance criteria for each position and a comparison of the results against the\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 79\ntraining, skills, and experience of its current members. Performance goals, based on the management\nplan recommended above, should be developed as part of the performance appraisal process. LAWA\nhas already identified deficiencies in vehicles and associated equipment and those requirements are\nnow in the procurement cycle.\nObservation 19: Risk Management and Preparedness\nRisk assessment is core to emergency management and sets a baseline for all risk mitigation and\nresponse and recovery planning, which in turn drives development of all preparedness capabilities.\nWhether in security or emergency management, more of something is not necessarily better. What is\nimportant is the prudent application of the right resources, against the right priorities, and implemented\nin the right way to manage risk. Although risk management is still in the early stages of adoption by\npublic agencies, its application is accelerating due largely to national policies that have emerged after\n9/11 and Hurricane Katrina and the ongoing development of risk practices. This observation deals with\nthe opportunity to capitalize on that trend and better harmonize risk assessment efforts across LAWA,\nadopt a LAWA-specific risk management program, and apply it in a way that best informs priority setting\nand budgeting for risk mitigation, to include improvements in preparedness and especially response\nplanning. It is possible that gaps in capabilities evident during the incident on November 1, 2013 could\nhave been identified and resolved through a more integrated risk assessment and planning process.\nBackground\nOver the last decade, preparedness planning has evolved to address all threats and all hazards and take\na multi-disciplinary approach to risk assessment and risk mitigation. There are not enough resources to\neliminate risk but risk exposure can be assessed and, through priority setting, planning, and investment,\ncan be minimized and managed. Beyond facilitating responses to disasters, emergency management\nprograms are increasingly focused on efforts to identify and mitigate risks beforehand to lessen\npotential consequences through things like citizen awareness, physical hardening, and/or improvements\nacross the full range of response and recovery capabilities. Essential preparedness efforts to mitigate\nrisk include advance planning, related training, and exercises aimed at effective response operations.\nA number of different risk assessments have been conducted at LAX for a variety of purposes and from\nvarying perspectives. In addition, emergency management staff has compiled a hazard vulnerability\nassessment as a preamble to the response operations planning effort now underway. As of the writing\nof this report, the LAX Airport Emergency Plan (AEP) has been updated, the 19 annexes are in the final\nproduction stages, and the AEMC policy group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final approval is scheduled for April 17th with training\nto begin in May. Appropriately, those plans make assumptions concerning how the agency and its\npublic safety and airport partners will respond to a particular set of emergencies and identifies the\ncapabilities and resources needed to successfully manage them. A capabilities gap analysis was not\nconducted coincident with the development of these plans, although that process is now underway.\nThe NFPA 1600 and EMAP Standard emphasize the close and interdependent relationships between\nthreat / hazard identification and risk assessment, preparedness planning and capabilities gap analysis,\nand risk mitigation programs. That set of relationships plays out in a continuous cycle such as the one\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 80 Observations and Recommendations\ndescribed in FEMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NPS and the DHS risk management framework. Despite positive trends in their\nevolution and use, risk assessment concepts and terminology vary widely, as do approaches to the\nintegration of risk assessment results with planning and mitigation programs. The following summarizes\nsome of the basic ideas as a frame of reference for the analysis that follows.\nRisk Assessment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Risk has often been defined most simply as the product of the consequence and\nlikelihood of a disruptive event or hazard. When considering more complex risks like those related to\nmanmade events such as terrorism, the process becomes a bit more intricate and includes the added\nneed to in some way include a characterization of the threat. Whatever the methodology, risk\nassessment generally involves: 1) evaluating the criticality or relative importance of the entities being\nprotected; 2) defining the threats or hazards that apply; 3) assessing the vulnerabilities and capability\ngaps; 4) estimating the impact or consequence of a disruptive event; 5) determining the likelihood the\ndisruptive event will occur; and 6) calculating the resultant risk. Those vulnerabilities and capability\ngaps of concern can then be ranked in priority order and strategies to mitigate those risks considered.\nRisk Management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A risk assessment sets a baseline from which mitigation measures can be applied\nand overall risk reduced. Some assessments may focus on only a single threat or facility while others\naddress a range of hazards or facilities. Whatever the scope, there is likely never enough funding to\naddress all vulnerabilities and so trade-offs need to be made. By developing a menu of mitigation\noptions and estimating their risk reduction potential and cost, planners can suggest combinations of\noptions that will return the greatest risk reduction benefit for the funding available. The choices are\npresented to leadership who decides on priorities and how much risk reduction it can afford and then\nselects options to fund. If this process is consistently repeated, the organization moves from single\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153one-off\u00e2\u20ac assessment to an ongoing cycle of risk management. The key point is that assessments\nalone have limited value if they do not lead to the managed and cost-effective reduction of risk.\nRisk-based Planning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c National policy and best practice from FEMA and both NAFPA 1600 and the\nEMAP Standard recommend risk assessment as the prerequisite step in preparedness planning. That\nstep should address all significant threats and hazards to the jurisdiction to include, manmade (e.g.,\nterrorism or other violent attacks); natural events (e.g., storms and earthquakes), and technological\n(e.g., an energy disruption), along with the interdependencies and cascading effects of those risks. It\nshould consider a range of impacts on people, facilities and systems, and should assess the adequacy\nof existing prevention, protection, response, and recovery strategies in place. As risks and the options\nto mitigate related vulnerabilities and capability gaps are identified, this information is factored into\nthe organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management plan and its plans for security and disaster response operations.\nPlanning for Response Operations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Emergency management planning processes should be formal,\ndocumented, and involve a range of stakeholders to provide diversity of perspective and facilitate\ncommunity buy-in to the adoption of those plans. Standing committees are a best practice and are\nstrongly encouraged as plans are in a constant state of updating and refinement. Moreover, as gaps\nare identified, these committees provide a platform for corrective action and can guide related\ntraining and exercises. The work of a planning committee should be informed by an all-hazards risk\nassessment. Based on that assessment, a concept for response operations is then formulated, the\ncapabilities needed are assessed, and gaps are identified in those capabilities. More refined strategies\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 81\nfor response are then prepared, initiatives to address the gaps are surfaced to management, priorities\nare set and resourced, and the final plan is trained to and exercised.\nAnalysis\nLAWA has made great progress in response operations planning and training, however significant work\nstill remains. The process is firmly established, there is whole-community engagement through an\nemergency management committee structure, and the effort has been well supported by consultants.\nMoreover, vulnerability and risk assessments have been conducted that provide insight into strengths\nand weaknesses in security and emergency response capabilities. However, though the assessments are\nvaluable, there has been no consistent approach to harmonizing them, there is no means to integrate\nsecurity and non-security risk as a baseline for decision-making, and follow-up appears to be on a case-\nby-case basis rather than part of a unified risk management program.\nRecent Assessments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There have been a series of recent vulnerability or risk assessments and related\nstudies of LAX either by various outside agencies or internal staff. Each has been different in purpose,\nscope, approach, and the community of stakeholders involved. These include:\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 2004 RAND Near-Term Options for Improving Security at Los Angeles International Airport\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 2011 The Los Angeles International Airport Peer Review Study\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 2011 DHS Office of Infrastructure Protection Site Assistance Visit\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 2011 Report of the Mayor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Blue Ribbon Panel on Airport Security\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 2013 TSA/FBI Joint Vulnerability Assessment\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 2014 LAWA Emergency Management Division Hazard Vulnerability Assessments\nNotwithstanding the prior assessments listed above, there is no central tracking or oversight for the\nresolution of vulnerability and risk assessment results having implications for LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security and\nemergency management programs. Threats and hazards to LAX are not consolidated in a single\noverall risk profile for annual or biennial executive review, and the approval of risk mitigation\nmeasures for funding are done incrementally rather than as part of an integrated and prioritized set of\nrisk-based options for decision-making. The latter is essential to any program of risk management.\nAn integrated approach is also important if risk assessments are to be an effective first step in\nemergency response planning and preparedness training and exercises.\nPlanning Governance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The process for response plan development at LAWA is highly evolved and has\noutstanding representation from a broad cross-section of internal and external stakeholders. Both\nstaff-level participation in developing the plans and executive level guidance and oversight are strong\nand show significant leadership commitment. The inclusive whole-community approach adopted to\ndevelop LAWA response plans is consistent with best practice and has helped to form stronger\ncollaboration among key stakeholder groups. Planning support and oversight is provided by two\nstanding emergency management committees: the AEMC and AEMWG.\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Airport Emergency Management Committee (AEMC) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Made up of 24 executives from all LAWA\ndivisions as well as key leaders from City departments and federal agencies, this committee\nprovides senior-level direction to the planning effort and final approval of completed plans.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nPage 82 Observations and Recommendations\n\u00ef\u201a\u00a7 Airport Emergency Management Working Group (AEMWG) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This working committee consists of\nabout 35 core members and includes discipline-specific subject matter experts and supervisory\nlevel decision-makers from multiple LAWA divisions and external departments and agencies.\nPlan Development \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LAWA emergency management planning follows a deliberate eight-step process\nconducted by the AEMWG and facilitated / supported by the LAWA Emergency Management Division.\nThat process includes: 1) information gathering and scope definition; 2) work group assignments; 3)\ninitial draft development and interim AEMWG approval; 4) a planning workshop and plan refinement;\n5) production of a final draft plan; 6) AEMC review and approval; 7) training to familiarize responders\nwith the plan; and 8) formal activation of the final plan. As well-structured as the process is, aside\nfrom its selection of threat and hazard scenarios, it does not include a means to identify and resolve\nvulnerabilities, risks, or related gaps in capabilities. The need for a tactical EMS capability to support a\nRescue Task Force is an example of a gap that surfaced during the active shooter incident of\nNovember 1, 2013 that would be of the kind identified and resolved during the planning process.\nIt should be noted that, of the 19 AEP annexes originally commissioned for development in 2012, only\n13 have been completed and have provisional approval, while another 6 are still in development\nscheduled for completion by March 30, 2014. Although the draft Active Shooter Annex was originally\nprepared in March 2013, it had not been promulgated beforehand due to competing authorities at the\nAEMC and thus was not used in the response to the November 1 incident. While collaboration and\nconsensus are very important in a governance structure like the City of Los Angeles and LAWA, it is\nimperative that the relevant stakeholders commit to timely response and support their\nrepresentatives, or LAWA must develop an alternative methodology to drive decision-making to\ncompletion in order to move forward. As is often said\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perfect is the enemy of the good.\u00e2\u20ac\nIn addition to the pending status of annex development, there are a set of outdated response plans\nmaintained independently in a LAWAPD Airport Emergency Operations Plan (AEOP) that include both\nsecurity and non-security guidance to the Police Division. As such, there is overlap between the AEOP\nand the AEP and its annexes. That overlap should be resolved and the security aspects of the AEOP\nincorporated into other LAWA security plans as appropriate to eliminate redundancy, which can\ninherently breed conflict. Given LAWA emergency management staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of familiarity with\nperimeter security strategies employed on November 1, continued cross-training in all response plans\nalong with joint incident command practices is warranted.\nPreparedness Training and Exercises \u00e2\u20ac\u201c LAWA began training its staff in the NIMS and ICS in 2011.\nThis not only includes training in basic NIMS and ICS fundamentals but also more advanced training in\nmulti-agency incident command operations at the Texas A&M Emergency Services Training Institute\n(ESTI), a DHS chartered center of excellence for emergency services training for first responders across\nthe country. Beyond the full-scale exercises mandated by the FAA, LAWA has also implemented\ninnovative approaches to tabletops and mini-exercises that reinforce classroom -based ICS instruction\nand permit testing of planning assumptions. LAWA Readiness Assessment and Performance\nImprovement Drills (RAPID) provide a low-cost and effective way to practice ICS and strengthen inter-\nunit collaboration. Extending this concept to more senior response leadership, to include LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\npublic safety partners and airport stakeholders would yield even greater value.\nOf fic\nial LA\nW A\nDo cu\nme nt\nLos Angeles International Airport Active Shooter Incident\nObservations and Recommendations Page 83\nRecommendations\nRecommendation 19.1: Adopt unified risk management to consolidate assessment results and array\nmitigation options in a way that supports Department-wide priority setting and decision-making.\nLAWA has had the benefit of a number of vulnerability and risk assessments, security studies, and\nhazard impact analyses all of which provide significant information to inform risk mitigation planning.\nIts challenge is to now integrate that information and manage it. The process must orient leadership\nto the agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overall risk profile across all threats and hazards, present options for investment in risk\nreduction in a way that supports priority setting and informed decision-making, then monitors and\ntracks implementation of those initiatives to ensure overall risk mitigation aims are achieved. The risk\nmanagement process should span both security and emergency management, incorporate the benefit\nof assessments by others, and firmly integrate security and emergency response planning.\nSupplementing LAWA Emergency Management staff with staff from partner agencies could help\naugment the skill shortage within LAWA and reinforce the broad commitment the program needs.\nRecommendation 19.2: Bring the base Airport Emergency Plan update to a close, complete work on\nresponse annexes still pending, and resolve any outstanding issues that inhibit their adoption.\nA large amount of time and resources have been devoted to developing the AEP and its suite of\nscenario-based and functional annexes over a two year period. That effort has been at the expense of\nother equally fundamental aspects of emergency preparedness, to include response capability\ndevelopment. Work on the annexes should be brought to a close as soon as practical and the focus of\nthe AEMC and AEMWG should turn to testing and validating the base AEP and its finalization.\nValidating the annexes could follow in stages and be integrated into ongoing training and exercises.\nThe focus of the AEMC and AEMWG could then shift to mitigating gaps in general preparedness,\nresponse capabilities, and multi-agency incident command.\nRecommendation 19.3: Reinforce the program of incident command training already established,\nemphasizing joint training and exercises with LAWA public safety partners and airport stakeholders.\nAdvance planning is basic to emergency preparedness. The capability to rapidly and seamlessly\nimplement multi-agency incident command and execute well-coordinated response operations jointly\nacross LAWA and with its public safety partners is even more so. LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to train Police and\nkey civilian staff in incident command practices are laudable and must continue to mature. As outlined\nin observations elsewhere in this report, LAWA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s training and exercise program must place significant\nemphasis on building the capacity to execute unified ICP and DOC operations, as well as strengthen\ninter-unit and interagency coordination in implementing response strategies. Like its planning efforts,\nLAWA must take a whole-community approach to response training and exercises. Such\nimprovements will take time and so a phased multi-year training and exercise plan is suggested.
