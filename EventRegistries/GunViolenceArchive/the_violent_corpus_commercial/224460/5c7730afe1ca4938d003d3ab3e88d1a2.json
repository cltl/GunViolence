(AP) -- Tulsa police have identified a U.S. Army Reserve specialist as the woman who was fatally shot by her 3-year-old son.\nHomicide Sgt. Dave Walker said Tuesday the toddler accidentally shot 26-year-old Christa Engles in the head at their home on Monday. He says she appeared to be changing her 10-month-old daughter's diaper in the living room when she was shot.\nEngles was taken to an area hospital where she later died.\nOfficers believe the boy picked up the loaded 9 mm semi-automatic handgun from an open holster on a low-lying table in the room. His grandmother found the woman shot and called 911. They say the boy tried to leave the house before his grandmother arrived."}
