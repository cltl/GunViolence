(WOOD) \u2014 The 14-year-old girl who was wounded during Saturday\u2019s shooting spree in and around Kalamazoo remained in critical condition Wednesday at Bronson Children\u2019s Hospital.\nDoctors said on Monday Abigail Kopf was still on a ventilator fighting for her life.\nThe family previously asked that the teen not be identified, but rescinded that request Monday evening when addressing the media.\n\u201cAbigail, her parents and our team continue to fight hard for her life,\u201d Dr. Aaron Lane-Davies said. \u201cIn spite of the seriousness of her injuries, we are encouraged by her relative stability over the past couple of days and her responsiveness to her parents and our team.\u201d\nFamily members said earlier Monday that her prognosis was uncertain. Vickie Kopf fought back tears Monday evening as the doctor described her daughter\u2019s condition.\n\u201cEverybody needs to get that straight. My daughter is not dead. She is alive and she is fighting for her life. I want everybody to understand that,\u201d Vickie said.\nAbigail still \u201chas a long road ahead,\u201d said her father, Gene Kopf, but is \u201cstrong-willed and fighting.\u201d\n\u201cAs of right now she is actually showing some progress. Which is great news,\u201d said Vickie.\nAbigail was shot outside the Texas Township Cracker Barrel, the last of three shootings that made up Saturday\u2019s spree.\nShe had joined four women for dinner at the Cracker Barrel, then went to see a show at Miller Auditorium. The group had returned to the restaurant to pick up a car when they were shot while sitting in their vehicles just before 10:30 p.m.\nAll four women, 60-year-old Mary Jo Nye of Battle Creek, her 62-year-old sister-in-law Mary Lou Nye of Baroda, 68-year-old Barbara Hawthorne of Battle Creek and 74-year-old Dorothy Brown of Battle Creek were killed.\n\u201cAbigail is strong, and she is a vibrant beautiful young lady and she did not deserve this. And either did her grandmother or those other victims,\u201d Vickie Kopf said.\nAbigail was rushed to the hospital. Her heart stopped beating at one point, Dr. Lane-Davies said Monday, but doctors were able to restart it.\n\u201cDue to both the nature of her injuries and the efforts required to sustain her life, our team discussed the possibility that she could become brain dead,\u201d Lane-Davies said. \u201cAt the request and with the permission of Abigail\u2019s parents, our team contacted Gift of Life to begin the process that ensures the dignity and safety of the injured person. The active organ donation after a tragedy like this one can only occur after a person has died. Determining brain death requires a series of physical exams, sometimes in conjunction with other testing, over the course of multiple hours. This series of exams has not begun due to Abigail\u2019s medical condition. Abigail was not declared medically brain dead. She has undergone a surgical procedure to address her injuries and remains on the ventilator and critically ill.\u201d\nThe night of the shooting, Abigail squeezed her mother\u2019s hand, giving them new hope.\n\u201cBreathtaking,\u201d Vickie Kopf described that moment. \u201cA miracle on its own. You don\u2019t expect and then all of a sudden, it\u2019s there.\u201d\nShe and her husband have been by Abigail\u2019s bedside since the shooting. Vickie Kopf said Abigail has been wiggling her toes.\nAbigail called Hawthorne \u201cGrandma Barb,\u201d though the two are not related by blood. Abigail\u2019s parents say she loves theater and that Hawthorne would often take her to see shows, like they did on Saturday.\n\u201cEver since she was a baby, they have done things together,\u201d Vickie Kopf said. \u201cShe (Barbara) was a beautiful woman. She was a free spirit. Had an infectious laugh and she gave the most wonderful hugs. And she didn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d\nShe and her husband thanked the community, police and team of doctors treating their daughter.\nThe Kopfs have another 6-year-old daughter, who they say may not completely understand what happened.\nBarbara Hawthorne\u2019s family released this statement on Monday:\n\u201cWe are devastated and bewildered that our \u2018Auntie Barb\u2019 was taken from us in such a horrible and senseless way.\n\u201cOur \u2018Auntie Barb\u2019 was easy to laugh, a generous, giving person who loved her many friends and family. She was a true \u201chippie\u201d who marched for civil rights in the deep south, recycled everything that came through the house, and believed in marching to your own drummer. She loved the theatre and live music and shared tickets to performances whenever possible. Her table was often surrounded by her Euchre or crochet group. She believed in authentic connection and built her own family among her many friends and loved ones.\n\u201cShe was deeply loved and respected and will be missed by everyone who knew her.\u201d\nRich Smith, 53, and his 17-year-old son, Tyler were shot and killed at a Kalamazoo vehicle dealership about 15 minutes before the Cracker Barrel shooting. Kalamazoo Public Safety Chief Jeff Hadley told 24 Hour News 8 Monday Tyler\u2019s girlfriend hid from the gunman and survived.\nThe shootings started around 5:45 p.m. Saturday when Tiana Carruthers was shot several times outside Meadows Townhomes. The Kalamazoo County prosecutor said Monday she is recovering.\nSt. Augustine Cathedral held a mass to pray for the victims early Monday afternoon. The Battle Creek Community Foundation also set up a Help Now fund to support the community as it grieves.\nThe shooting suspect, 45-year-old Jason Dalton of the Kalamazoo area, was was formally charged in the case Monday.\nThe Kopfs aid their thoughts are with the family of the man charged with shooting their daughter and killing six others.\n\u201cWe want his family to know that we don\u2019t hold anything against the family members,\u201d Gene Kopf said.\nInside woodtv.com:\nComplete coverage of the Kalamazoo shooting rampage\n**Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Vickie Kopf\u2019s first name.
