The other seven people, including a second person who was taken to a local hospital, did not suffer life-threatening injuries, police said. Their names have not been released.\nDeanna Wilson, who lives on Hinson Drive, said she heard between 15 and 20 gunshots that sounded like \"a roll of firecrackers.\"\n\"You didn't hear anything but gunshots, and then you heard a bunch of yelling and commotion,\" she said. \"The whole neighborhood erupted into chaos. Everybody came out of their house. You only see stuff like that on TV.\"\nNo arrests have been made, but a Durham Police Department spokesman confirmed that officers had canvassed the neighborhood earlier Friday because of increased tensions that resulted from a separate shooting earlier this week.\n\u201cThey were out canvassing, just knocking on doors,\u201d Wilson said.\nAuthorities said Saturday that they are looking for a white vehicle that may have been involved in Friday\u2019s incident.\nAnyone with information about the shooting should call Durham Crime Stoppers at 919-683-1200.\nCrime Stoppers pays cash rewards for information leading to arrests in felony cases and callers never have to identify themselves."}
