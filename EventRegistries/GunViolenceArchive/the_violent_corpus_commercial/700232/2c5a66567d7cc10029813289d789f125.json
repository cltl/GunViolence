Brian Ahearn said on Wednesday it\u2019s unclear why Fernandez went there about 9:15 p.m. Sunday, but investigators believe he got into a fistfight with his ex-wife\u2019s boyfriend over the pair\u2019s relationship.\nAfter the fight, police said Fernandez went to his car and got a handgun, chased the boyfriend away and then returned to the apartment complex and opened fire.\nGonzalez and her 67-year-old grandfather were wounded. Her parents, Reyna Gonzalez, 42, and Julian Gonzalez, 45, were killed. The mother died Sunday, and the father died Wednesday morning, Ahearn said.\nThe mother was shielding her daughter when she was shot, Ahearn said. The father was trying to wrestle the gun away from Fernandez when he was wounded, a family member said.\nFernandez dragged his ex-wife into the street and had her in a headlock, his gun trained on her, when police arrived.\nOfficer Ross Bainbridge, who was accompanied by an officer in training, repeatedly told Fernandez to lay on the ground, Ahearn said.\nInstead, the gunman threatened to harm the woman or police, the captain said. Bainbridge then shot Fernandez once with a shotgun, killing him. Ahearn said the officer is a 12-year veteran of the department.\nThe slain couple were excellent role models who always took care of and protected their family, said daughter Cecilia Gonzalez. \u201cOur family is in terrible pain after losing our parents,\u201d she said Wednesday.\nShe said despite such devastating losses, their family does not blame the Fernandez family. A GoFundMe page was started to help with funeral costs.\nFernandez was initially identified by the county Medical Examiner\u2019s Office as a former boyfriend of Isabel Gonzalez, but court records show they we married on Halloween in 2014.\nThe couple separated nine months later. A divorce was filed in December 2015, and in February Gonzalez filed for and was given a restraining order against Fernandez.\nIn a letter to the court, she said Fernandez would randomly show up at her apartment to try to talk with her. He would tell her his friends had seen her leaving her home at specific times, making her feel as if she were being watched.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe even walking out of my house,\u201d she wrote.\nFernandez disagreed with the restraining order, saying he was merely trying to talk with her to see if he could change her mind about the divorce, according to court documents.\nHe wrote that he would never harm her or her dog. \u201cPlus, I don\u2019t know why I would harm anyone,\u201d he said.\nThe court granted a one-year restraining order in March, saying there was \u201cevidence that domestic violence or a threat of domestic violence has been committed.\u201d Fernandez was advised he couldn't own, possess or buy guns, and pledged that he didn\u2019t have any firearms or ammunition, according to court records.\nTwitter: @LAWinkley\n(619) 293-1546\nlyndsay.winkley@sduniontribune.com"}
