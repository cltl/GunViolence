The motive remained under investigation Saturday.\nSources told CBS 2 that Brown knocked on the family\u2019s door Friday afternoon and asked for a man inside. He then allegedly killed that man execution style before shooting the other victims on his way out.\nAfterward, helicopters hovered overhead as police searched for Brown. At one point, officers in tactical gear searched the building across the street, wearing heavy Kevlar vests and combat-style helmets, and carrying ballistic shields.\nThe shooting did not surprise one woman who lives down the street, and who talked to WCBS 880\u2019s Peter Haskell.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always shooting here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s always somebody.
