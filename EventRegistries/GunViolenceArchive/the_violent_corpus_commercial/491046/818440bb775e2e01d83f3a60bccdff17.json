Prosecutors will decide whether to seek the death penalty against Williams, who was embarking on a brutal crime spree when he killed the girl, investigators said.\nWilliams is also accused of killing a man who he attempted to rob during a dice game in Berkeley in September, authorities said.\n\u201cSome crimes rock the agency and the community; they affect us forever. This is one,\u201d said Oakland police Assistant Chief Paul Figueroa. \u201cKilling an 8-year-old is as despicable as it gets.\u201d\nAlameda County District Attorney Nancy O\u2019Malley said the suspects went to the Wilson Avenue apartment intent on killing someone they believed was responsible for Davis\u2019 killing and \u201cdid not care\u201d who was inside when they opened fire.\nCourt documents show the suspects knew that their intended target\u2019s children and their mother lived in the Dimond District apartment. Carradine was staying at her friend\u2019s house.\nWilliams, after orchestrating the killing with Carroll, rang the doorbell at 11:18 p.m.; as soon as Alaysha\u2019s friend, a 7-year-old girl, opened the door, he started shooting, O\u2019Malley said. The bullets pierced the apartment\u2019s metal gate and hit four of the five people inside. Alaysha was killed and her friend, a 4-year-old boy and their 64-year-old grandmother were wounded.\nCarroll was arrested Sept. 27 in Houston, and Williams was arrested Sept. 8 by Berkeley police.\nWilliams and Laquana Nuno are also charged with the Sept. 8 killing of Anthony Medearis in the 1400 block of Eighth Street in West Berkeley. Williams was shooting dice with Medearis and others when he decided to rob Medearis, according to court papers.\nWilliams shot Medearis, and in the process, a bullet fragment struck Williams\u2019 7-year-old nephew in the face, documents show. Nuno agreed to be a getaway driver for Williams, and fled police after Williams jumped out of her car, authorities said.\nWilliams was arrested later that night, found hiding in a shed, according to police.\nCarroll and three other suspected gang members \u2014 Joseph Connors, Emando Roos and Travon Wilson \u2014 were also charged with conspiring to murder two men who Carroll believed had disrespected him and his brother, authorities said. Information developed during the course of the investigation into Alaysha\u2019s death allowed police to prevent the killing, including when some of the men were stalking the targets at an unnamed Oakland nightclub, authorities said.\nNuno, Connors, Roos and Wilson were arrested Saturday after police served search warrants in Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward.\nSpeaking at a news conference announcing the arrests, O\u2019Malley said the killing of Alaysha \u201cshocked all of us\u201d and showed the \u2018disregard for human life\u201d that gang members have.\nShe singled out Oakland police homicide investigator Officer Rob Rosin, who headed the case, for bringing it to a successful conclusion.\nMayor Jean Quan said Alaysha\u2019s killing \u201creally broke my heart\u201d and said she hopes the arrests \u201cwill send a signal\u201d that violent crime will not be tolerated.\nAlaysha, whose family called her \u201cLadybug,\u201d would have started third grade at Fruitvale Elementary School in August. Her death was Oakland\u2019s 54th homicide this year, and she is one of the youngest Oakland homicide victims this year.\nLess than three weeks after Alaysha\u2019s death, 16-month-old Drew Jackson was shot and killed, along with his 20-year-old father, as the two slept next to each other at an aunt\u2019s East Oakland home."}
