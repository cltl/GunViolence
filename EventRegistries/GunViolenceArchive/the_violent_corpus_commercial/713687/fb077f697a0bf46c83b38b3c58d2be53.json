The assailant and his cohort then drove off to the north, Sgt. Tom Sullivan said.\nThe victim and his companion, meanwhile, ran away to the east. At 45th and Craigie streets, several blocks from the site of the shooting, they allegedly were seen putting a bag under a parked car before being picked up by the driver of another vehicle. Officers subsequently recovered the satchel, which contained a shotgun, the sergeant said.\nThe wounded teen was dropped off at Scripps Mercy Hospital in Hillcrest, where he underwent treatment for his non-life-threatening gunshot injury."}
