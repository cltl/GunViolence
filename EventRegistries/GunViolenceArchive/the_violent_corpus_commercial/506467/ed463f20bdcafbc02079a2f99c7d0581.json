Other details, including who shot the child and how the incident happened, were still under investigation Tuesday night, but Lewis said it was believed to be accidental.\nFlores said she\u2019s seen the family of four outside often while going on walks with her own kids. She and her family moved in about four years ago and the family was already there.\nFlores described her neighbors as \u201csweet\u201d and said she often waves and says \u201chi\u201d when she\u2019s passing through.\nMelanie Hernandez and Lauren Jackson, both Texas Tech students who live on the street behind the family, said they were on their way to the gym when they noticed all the police cars and saw the EMS trucks pull up.\nA swing set could be seen Tuesday night behind the fenced-in backyard, and a small, red push car could be seen just inside the garage.\nHernandez and Jackson said they always see the kids outside.\n\u201cThey would pretend to hammer on the fence,\u201d Hernandez said.\nSylvia Botello was sitting inside Trinity Church just across the street from the scene when she saw the first responders pull up.\n\u201cIn the 27 years I\u2019ve worked here, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d she said.\nHernandez said she considers it a safe neighborhood and was \u201cshocked\u201d at the news of the child\u2019s death.\nLewis said the incident is under investigation and did not release names.\nellysa.gonzalez@lubbockonline.com\n\u2022 766-8795\nFollow Ellysa on Twitter @AJ_Ellysa"}
