These are all older guys.\u201d\nThe first victim, identified as in his 60s, died hours before the second, a 43-year-old man, Detroit Police Officer Jennifer Moreno said. The two survivors, whose conditions at local hospitals were unknown, also are in their 40s and 60s, she said.\nTheir relationship wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\nThe shooting happened at about 3:40 p.m. at a home in the 2600 block of Hazelwood near Linwood. The victims were on the porch when three men in a black Dodge Journey SUV opened fire.\n\u201cThere were two types of weapons used: A pistol and a long gun,\u201d Dolunt said.\nDolunt said he didn\u2019t believe the first man slain was the intended target.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early, and I could be wrong, but that\u2019s what it looks like,\u201d he said.\nWitnesses did not provide a full description of the shooters, Dolunt said.\nThe shooting unnerved neighbors and others on the street, which is lined with mostly two-story homes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking,\u201d said Renee Little, whose family lives nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s daylight.\u201d\nKiara Head was down the street with her children and preparing to pick up another when she heard multiple shots.\nShe eventually learned her friendly neighbor had died.\n\u201cHe had a heart so big,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHe helped me carry groceries, played with my kids, loved them as if they were his own grandkids. He\u2019s going to be missed.\u201d\nAnyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers of Michigan at (800) 773-2587.\nghunter@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2134"}
