Fox Dallas-Fort Worth reports Braison was trying to wrest control of the gun back from Tristan when it accidentally discharged. Braison was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\u201cBy all accounts, this is just a tragic accident,\u201d Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner told WFAA.\nAt least three adults were home at the time of the shooting. Investigators are still piecing together what happened on that tragic day; it is not yet known whether anyone will face charges in connection with the fatal shooting. Under Texas law, children under the age of 10 cannot be charged with a crime, Tanner said."}
