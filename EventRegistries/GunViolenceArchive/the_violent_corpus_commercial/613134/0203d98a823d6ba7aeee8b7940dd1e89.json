They said one of them, a 15-year-old boy, was playing with a gun, and Rodriguez tried to stop him.\n\u201cThe victim took the gun away from him,\u201d said Sgt. David Soto with SAPD. \u201cWhen he grabbed it, the gun went off.\u201d\nRodriguez, who was shot in the chest, was taken to University Hospital by ambulance. He died later from his wound.\nThe 15-year-old suspect, meanwhile, had become frightened and ran off, police said. After officers search the area for about an hour, they said two men walked up and handed them a gun, saying the suspect was inside their nearby apartment.\nDrevonte King told KSAT 12 News he and his brother were shocked when the suspect barged into their home.\n\u201cHe was, like, \u2018I shot somebody! I shot somebody!,\u201d King said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019 So he goes to the bathroom and tries to put the bullets in the toilet.\u201d\nKing said his brother quickly wrestled the gun away from the suspect. He and his brother then walked out of their home toward the officers.\nHowever, King said he began to worry that they, armed with the gun, might get into trouble.\n\u201cWe got on our knees because a lot of people are being killed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we came and did that, got on the ground and gave them the gun. Then we told them (the suspect) was in our apartment.\u201d\nPolice said they found the 15-year-old inside the brothers\u2019 apartment and arrested him without incident. Soto said although the shooting was accidental, he could face a charge of manslaughter.\nAs of 8:30 a.m., police had not released the name of the teen who was arrested.\nCopyright 2016 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}
