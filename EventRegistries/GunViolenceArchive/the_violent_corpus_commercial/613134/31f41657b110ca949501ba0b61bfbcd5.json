David Soto. \"When he grabbed it, the gun went off.\"\nThe victim, Diego Rodriguez, suffered a gunshot wound to the chest. He was taken to University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nThe suspect was frightened and ran away, police said.\nAfter about an hour of searching for him, officers said they were approached by two men who handed them a gun and told them where to find the suspect.\nDrevonte King told KSAT 12 News that he and his brother were the men who gave police the weapon. King said the teenage suspect barged into his apartment in the 3600 block of Callaghan Road, visibly upset about what had happened.\n\"He was, like, 'I shot somebody! I shot somebody!\" King said. \"He said,'I don't know what to do.' So he goes to the bathroom and tries to put the bullets in the toilet. He was scared. You could tell in his eyes that he didn't want to come out. He didn't want to talk to nobody. But me and my brother knew what was best for him.\"\nOn his way to talk to police, King said he began to worry whether he and his brother might be walking into trouble. He said he wasn't taking any chances on police mistaking him for the suspect.\n\"We get on our knees because a lot of black people are being killed, so black lives matter to me,\" he said. \"We came and did that, got on the ground and gave them the gun.\"\nOfficers entered King's apartment and arrested the teen. Although police said the shooting appears to have been accidental, criminal charges are expected against the teen.\nCopyright 2016 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}
