The deceased were identified as Nolan\u2019s father, Adam Buchanan, 38, his fianc\u00e9e Molly McAfee, 37, and their 8-year-old son, Gavin. D\u2019Agostini said the three victims had been shot before the fire in the 4600 block of Highway 193. Adam Buchanan is president and chief operating officer of Buchanan Construction in Benicia.\nDeputies responded about 11 a.m. Sept. 13 to assist the Garden Valley Fire Department on a wildland fire. While searching the area, it was determined the residence had burned.\nD\u2019Agostini said arson investigators and sheriff\u2019s detectives joined in the investigation. Three bodies eventually were found.\nThe remains were sent to the Sacramento County Coroner\u2019s Office for examination and identification. Samples later were sent to the California Department of Justice for DNA analysis.\nThe residence belonged to Adam Buchanan.\nD\u2019Agostini said the Benicia Police Department contacted Nolan Buchanan, Adam Buchanan\u2019s son, at Adam Buchanan\u2019s Benicia home. The son told officers that his father, McAfee and his half-brother had driven to the Greenwood cabin, but he had not accompanied them.\nA search warrant was served at the Benicia residence and Adam Buchanan\u2019s construction company. D\u2019Agostini said a white Ford F150 truck that belonged to Adam Buchanan was found at the Benicia home, and evidence found inside the truck was contrary to the statement Nolan Buchanan had made to authorities.\nOn Sept. 19, a purse containing identification for McAfee and a wallet with identification for Adam Buchanan along with a firearm and ammunition were found in a business park near the Buchanan Construction Co. site.\nD\u2019Agostini declined to discuss a motive for the shootings. He said there are no other suspects in the case.\nInvestigators have not determined how the fire started, but they have confirmed that it was arson, D\u2019Agostini said.\nEl Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson said Thursday that Nolan Buchanan\u2019s arraignment had not been scheduled but could occur as early as Friday.\nDuring a news conference Thursday afternoon in Placerville, D\u2019Agostini said it was a sensitive investigation in an \u201cabsolutely tragic\u201d case.\n\u201cA father, a son and a mother all lost their life,\u201d and that, he said, is devastating to the family and the community.\nCathy Locke: 916-321-5287, @lockecathy"}
