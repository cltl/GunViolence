Rick Rodgers of the Los Angeles Police Department's 77th Street Division.\nThe victim, a passenger, was one of three males \u2014 ages 15 to 18 \u2014 in the vehicle, Rodgers said. They were riding around in the area when they were approached by another group of males standing on the street. Someone in that group fired several shots into the car, and the driver sped away.\nAnother passenger in the car, 17, said that they were driving near Vermont when the bullets started flying.\n\"Some man came from his house, and he just started letting off shots from the back of us,\" he said. \"My friend had turned back, and it hit him in the head.\"\nThe driver, 16, said he thinks the man who shot at them may have wanted to rob his car.\nThe number of suspects in the group and a description of the shooter were not immediately available.\nPolice are not sure whether the suspects took off on foot or in a car, but they believe the suspects were gang members."}
