We did have the five victims so it does qualify over that. With the 11-year-old there it ups the ante for us. Obviously this is something we want to get solved. We want to get this individual put behind bars,\" said Officer Richard Hilgeman of the Little Rock Police Department.\nThe investigation is still ongoing.
