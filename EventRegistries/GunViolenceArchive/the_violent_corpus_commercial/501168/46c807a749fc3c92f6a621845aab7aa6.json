He did not want to speak on camera, but was visibly shaken up over the situation.\n\"We don't want those things but people bring it to us. How can I avoid it? I think nobody can avoid it. Maybe I'm not the first, maybe I won't be the last\u2026but I wish those things don't happen to nobody,\" said Canela.\nRochester Police say there is no threat to the general public. According to Chief Michael Ciminelli, a dispute happened inside the bar before the shooting.\nTwo of the victims who survived were released from the hospital. Police do not have anyone in custody.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed."}
