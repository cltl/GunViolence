Court Commissioner Meagan Foley ordered him jailed in lieu of $1 million bail.\nTolbert died May 11 near South 93rd and Hosmer streets.\nHe reportedly was hanging out with as many as a dozen other young men about 8:30 p.m. when a Dodge Charger drove past, court records said. Tolbert allegedly had been \u201chaving problems\u201d with someone who drove a similar car, the records state.\nSomeone in Tolbert\u2019s group pulled out a revolver and opened fire as the Charger passed, the records state. His acquaintances told police the Charger then drove back by and someone inside fired two shots at the group, causing it to scatter.\nIt was only later that Tolbert\u2019s acquaintances realized he\u2019d been shot, the records show. Police reports indicate he was shot in the back and died at the scene.\nPolice talked to another witness who said no one in the Charger ever fired at Tolbert\u2019s group, the records show.\nReed was arrested three days later on a gun possession charge and booked into the Remann Hall juvenile detention center after police stopped a car he was riding in. They found a revolver jammed between his seat and the center console, court records show.\nReed denied owning the gun but said he\u2019d handled it earlier that day, the records state.\nThe state crime lab later determined the bullet that killed Tolbert was fired from the revolver found with Reed, prosecutors said.\nOn Wednesday, detectives interviewed Reed. He admitted being at the parking lot the night Tolbert died but denied shooting the teen.\n\u201cWhen confronted with the fact that he had been found with the murder weapon, the defendant claimed that he had switched guns with another member of his group after the shooting,\u201d deputy prosecutor Jesse Williams wrote in a determination for probable cause.\nDetectives talked to Reed again Thursday.\n\u201cThe defendant did admit that he had never traded guns after the shooting,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cThe interview was short and the detectives terminated it after it was clear that the defendant was too emotional and despondent over accidentally shooting and killing his friend.\u201d"}
