The older brother was shot in the head and underwent surgery at Denver Children's Hospital.\nInvestigators say the two boys were in the care of family friend because their parents had a medical appointment.

He never imagined when he saw the ambulances pull up, it would be for a nine year old boy.\n\"It was crazy. I didn't know it was a little boy at first. I didn't hear any of the gun shots, I didn't hear a gunshot or anything. Just saw the two cops come in and I came outside and then that's all I heard,\" says Romero.\nPolice have not arrested anyone, and the district attorney's office will review the investigation to determine what charges, if any, will be filed."}
