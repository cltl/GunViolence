An arrest warrant was issued Monday and Belmont was taken into custody in neighboring Chaffee County.\nOfficials say he was moved to the Park County jail before posting $50,000 bail.\nAuthorities say Belmont and his girlfriend stored a loaded shotgun in a children\u2019s play area in a home just southwest of Fairplay and that the firearm in turn caused the death of the toddler through means investigators are still working to uncover. The boy\u2019s name has not released.\nInvestigators indicated in the warrant that the shotgun possibly fell from a rack, discharging into the boy\u2019s upper body. Park County Undersheriff Dave Wohlers said, however, that officials might never know exactly what transpired.\n\u201cWe may never know. I think we\u2019re just not sure exactly how the weapon discharged,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s still a work in progress. Obviously it\u2019s concerning to have a loaded firearm just laying around where it can fall to the ground or be mishandled.\u201d\nBelmont\u2019s girlfriend, 30-year-old Stefanie Marie Wray, is also facing parallel charges in the case. She was arrested on Tuesday and was being held at the Jefferson County jail before posting $50,000 bail as well.\n\u201cIt also appears all of the other children living in this home were subjected to conditions threatening their life and death,\u201d the warrant says. Wohlers says the other children were between the 4 and 13 years old and that he didn\u2019t know of any prior law enforcement calls out to the home.\nInvestigators say they also found a loaded, .380-caliber pistol and a loaded, large-caliber rifle that were easily within in reach of the several children living in the house. According to the warrant, there was also a strong odor of urine and feces in the home as well as glass shards on the floor, dirty dishes strung about and \u201ca number of capped syringe needles.\u201d\nWhen Park County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived at the Nov. 13 shooting scene, they found the young boy\u2019s lifeless body in a bathtub clothed only with a diaper. It appears other children living in the home had seen the bloody scene.\nAuthorities were alerted to the shooting by someone who came to the North-West Fire Protection District station in Fairplay.\nThe boy\u2019s death was not made public until it was first reported Tuesday by KDVR-Channel 31. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation assisted prosecutors and sheriff\u2019s investigators with their probe.\n\u201cIt remains under investigation so there\u2019s nothing I can tell you right now,\u201d David Kintz, Park County\u2019s coroner, told The Denver Post.\nIn June 2014, Belmont was charged with sexual assault and accused of raping his estranged wife and briefly holding her captive in Aurora. Those accusations were later dismissed by prosecutors.\nAdams County deputy accused of sexually assaulting estranged wife: http://t.co/PWUjtoRLny\nAt the time of his arrest, Belmont had been working for the Adams County Sheriff\u2019s Office since 2004. When contacted Tuesday by The Denver Post, a department spokesman declined to discuss Belmont\u2019s employment, but said no one with his name is currently an Adams County deputy.\nSponsored Links\n.\nVital Reds SupplementHow To Fix Your Fatigue (Do This Every Day)Vital Reds Supplement\nForge Of Empires - Free Online GameThe most addictive game of the year!
