With all that goes on up there, so many people shooting and so many indiscriminate directions without really any rules or guidelines.\u201d\nThe 30-year-old Malaby was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Anchorage, where he was pronounced dead.\nThe name of the shooter was not released, and state troopers have not said how many gun owners were firing at the time.\nMalaby, a U.S. Army veteran, was trained to handle weapons, but some people who have been to the makeshift shooting range said he likely didn\u2019t realize he was in harm\u2019s way.\n\u201cI have had cases where people have fired guns in my direction from behind me,\u201d Dillon Barron, who has been to the gravel pits but now avoids the area. \u201cThere\u2019s usually never a firing line established and other shooters fail to communicate with one another if they have to go downrange. This is where it gets dangerous. Add alcohol and ATV riders to the mix, and you can easily see how it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen.\u201d\nInvestigators have not said whether alcohol was involved in the fatal shooting, but neighbors have asked city officials to improve safety conditions at the gravel pits \u2014 which they said attracts drugs and crime.\n\u201cAlcohol, drugs, there\u2019s people talking about hypodermic needles sitting out there,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cSome people are comparing it to like the Wild West. You can just go out there and do what you want to do.\u201d\nNo charges have been filed in Malaby\u2019s shooting death.\nWatch this video report posted online by KTVA-TV:"}
