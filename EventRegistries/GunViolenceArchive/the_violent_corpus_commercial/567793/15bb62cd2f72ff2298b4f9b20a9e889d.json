Nixon said it went in a downward angle and came out on the right side of the boy\u2019s neck right below his ear. He added no vital organs, veins or arteries were hit.\nThe detective said Clinton visited his nephew May 31 at Rainbow Babies & Children\u2019s Hospital and described him as alert and was able to remember what happened.\nThe detective said as soon as the boy was able to speak, he said, \u201cMy uncle shot me.\u201d The boy said it was an accident.\nNixon said it\u2019s likely Clinton fled because he is a convicted felon who shouldn\u2019t have a firearm.\nIt was determined that the gun involved in the incident wasn\u2019t reported stolen, but Nixon said that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it wasn\u2019t.\nAbout the Author\nKaylee is the Avon-Avon Lake reporter, but you can catch her covering different stories across the county.
