The names and conditions of those shot were not immediately known.\nAt least three other people believed involved were detained at the scene, Woolfolk said. Officers closed a portion of the street Wednesday afternoon to interview witnesses, including children who saw the shootings, according to police.\nInvestigators believe the shooting began as a verbal altercation between neighbors, but no information was released on a possible motive. Neighbors told Channel 2 that the incident began with an argument over a children\u2019s football game.\nStephanie Thompson, who moved in to a home on Center Hill Avenue on July 1, said she was inside when she heard a gunshot.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing my hair and I hear a pop, but I don\u2019t think nothing of it,\u201d Thompson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nBut when she heard a second shot, it scared her, and she and her mother turned on the news for information. Thompson, who lives seven houses down from the shooting scene, said she\u2019s thankful her family wasn\u2019t injured. But she\u2019s concerned for her 6-month-old baby.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to go,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI got a baby to raise. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d"}
