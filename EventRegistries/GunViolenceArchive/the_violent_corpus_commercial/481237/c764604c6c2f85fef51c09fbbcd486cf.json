Marisa Barnes, a police spokeswoman. \"There are three victims who are in serious but stable condition, and two that are in critical but stable condition.\"\nPart of the agreement for holding an event at the Tropical Palms is providing adequate security.\nThe owner of the banquet hall says he is not sure how many security guards were working Saturday night, but he does believe the building's cameras caught most of the incident on video.\nPolice are currently reviewing the footage.\nPolice say despite the large crowd, they have limited suspect information. But witnesses saw four people drive away from the banquet hall just after the shooting.\nNo one is in custody yet.\n(story by KCTV, Kansas City)\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
