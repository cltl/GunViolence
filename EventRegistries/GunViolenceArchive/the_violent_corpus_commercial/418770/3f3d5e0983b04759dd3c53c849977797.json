The driver pulled over, and the man in the front passenger seat got out, shot Gribble and ran away with the driver, the release said.\nAlong came a Macon Transit Authority bus, and Gribble stopped the driver, who called 911.\nThe wounded man was taken by ambulance to the hospital where he was in stable condition hours later.\nA crime lab technician photographed the abandoned car, which was parked with its flashers blinking about half a block from Nesbit Drive. The vehicle was towed to the crime lab.\nThe gunman is described as a black man who is about 6 feet tall and was wearing a black shirt and brown cargo pants.\nEarlier Tuesday morning, a juvenile was wounded in an accidental shooting in the Lynmore Estates neighborhood, Bibb sheriff\u2019s Lt. Randy Gonzalez said, but the two incidents do not appear to be connected.\nAnyone with information is urged to call an investigator at 478-751-7500 or phone anonymous tips to Macon Regional Crimestoppers at 877-68-CRIME.\nTo contact writer Liz Fabian, call 744-4303 and follow her on Twitter @liz_lines."}
