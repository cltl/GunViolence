All victims were transported, apparently via ambulance, to area hospitals for treatment.\nThe incident occurred shortly after midnight and other local agencies were called in to assist troopers from the Port Norris barracks, possibly due to the large number of people, as many as two hundred according to some sources, reportedly at the party.\nThe shooting is currently under investigation by State Police, and spokesman for police were unable to provide information as to suspects or a possible motive.\n--"}
