Mayhew was standing outside of a truck and attempted to retrieve his shotgun from the backseat by grabbing it by the barrel when it discharged.\nThe witnesses called 911 and began first aid until emergency responders arrived.\n\u201cThe males were all friends and relatives of each other,\u201d said JPD spokesman Lt. Dave Campbell. \u201cWhen (the victim) reached into the backseat, he pulled the shotgun toward him and the shotgun discharged. It was loaded and he basically was shot right in the torso.\u201d\nNo one else was injured when the shotgun fired.\nPolice chose not release a name because Mayhew was a minor, but multiple other sources confirmed his identity to the Empire.\nPolice are calling it a \u201ctragic accident\u201d and said \u201cat this point it looks totally accidental.\u201d Police have seized the weapon and the truck it came out of for evidence. An investigation is ongoing.\nNext of kin has been notified, as well as the Juneau School District. JSD will provide grief counseling to students when classes resume Monday."}
