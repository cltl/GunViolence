She had a gunshot wound to her upper torso, investigators say. Efforts to keep her alive failed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital.\nSgt. Tony Turnbull said the victim had been sitting in a parked vehicle with two men when a gun went off. It\u2019s not yet clear if the shooting was intentional, or if the gun went off accidentally, he said.\nNo names or other details have been released.\nA recording of Sacramento County dispatchers directing deputies to the shooting paints a confusing picture of passers-by unclear what was happening. At least one caller thought it might have been a car accident. Dispatchers reported they could hear a female voice screaming, \u201cHe killed her,\u201d while a male voice yelled, \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d\nRyan Sabalow: 916-321-1264, @ryansabalow"}
