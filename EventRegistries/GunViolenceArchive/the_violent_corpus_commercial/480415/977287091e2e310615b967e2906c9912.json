Minor asked for a court-appointed attorney.\nThe shooting happened Sept. 17, 2013 about two blocks away from the high school, shortly after the final bell. Three Sexton students \u2014 a 17-year-old girl and two boys, 14 and 15 \u2014 suffered gunshot wounds that were not life threatening. There was a fourth victim, a 15-year-old boy, who showed up later at a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Officials never said whether he was a student.\nA disagreement involving multiple teenagers led to the shooting. A group of students decided to go to the area where the shooting happened possibly to settle an argument, police have said.\nMinor, who was 16 when the shooting happened, was not a registered student at the time, according to Lansing schools spokesman Bob Kolt.\nA 16-year-old boy already has been charged as a juvenile in the shooting, officials said. He is not being named by the Lansing State Journal because he is a juvenile.\nA third teen, Narrion Lamont Caston, is charged as an adult in the incident \u2014 but not with firing a gun. Officials declined to discuss Caston\u2019s alleged involvement. In March, he was ordered to stand trial on charges of carrying a concealed weapon and felony firearm."}
