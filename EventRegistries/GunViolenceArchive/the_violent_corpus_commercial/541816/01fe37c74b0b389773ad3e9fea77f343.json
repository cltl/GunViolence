The shooting happened at a family gathering at about 5pm at a home on Precious Place and Roth Forest Ln.\nEyewitness News spoke exclusively to a teen who saw the shooting.\n\"When the 40-year-old man went to go get his dry clothes, he had a gun somewhere in there. And when he went to holster it he was spinning it on his finger, he pulled the trigger and accidentally shot her near the collarbone,\" said Lawrence Martinez.\nHe pointed to an area near his collarbone and neck to indicate where she was shot.\nThe girl did not have life threatening injuries and was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital in The Woodlands and was listed in stable condition.\nThe man with the 9mm appeared to be a family friend, according to neighbors. Lt. Daniel Garza said he could be charged with deadly conduct. One bullet ended up lodged in a car door several houses down.\nTwo people arrived at the home where the family gathering was taking place at about 8:30 pm. A man asked for privacy and would not answer questions, but said he has to take care of his niece and he's glad she will be okay."}
