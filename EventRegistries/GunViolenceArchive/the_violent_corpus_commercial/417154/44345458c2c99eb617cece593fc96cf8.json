Ogden Police Lt. Jake Sube said she was very lucky.\n\"It absolutely could have been very tragic,\" he said.\nThe incident happened just after 3 p.m. while the girls were at their grandparents' home in the 100 North block of Pingree Ave.\n\"It appears that the two girls were alone cleaning the grandparents' bedroom when the gun was found. Moments after finding the gun, the 11-year-old accidentally discharged the firearm striking the 13-year-old in the neck,\" he said.\nSube did not know Sunday where in the bedroom the gun was found. The older girl actually told her sister to be careful after she found the weapon because it might be loaded, he said.\n\"About the same moment it was fired,\" Sube said.\nThe weapon used was described as an older model .22-caliber revolver, Sube said. Police believe the elderly grandparents had not used the gun for many years and likely forgot it was in the bedroom.\n\"It had been out of sight, out of mind for a long time,\" Sube said.\nHe said the bullet broke her skin but did not penetrate any vital organs. He said a lump in her skin where the bullet came to rest could be seen.\n\"When police first made contact with the victim, she was conscious and alert but obviously shaken up. She was taken to a local hospital in good spirits and will likely have surgery to remove the bullet,\" Sube said. \"She had a very positive attitude.\"\nNo arrests were made or citations issued Sunday. The investigation would continue, he said.\n\"The family involved has avoided a tragedy today and we are very thankful. This could have been much worse,\" said Sube who also said the incident was a good reminder for all gun owners to keep their weapons secured in their homes, even if they don't have children of their own.\nTwitter: DNewsCrimeTeam"}
