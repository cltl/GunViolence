Jennifer Ciaccia said. A 33-year-old man suffered several gunshot wounds.\nHe was taken to University Hospitals by Cleveland EMS, where he was pronounced dead, Ciaccia said.\nThe Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office will identity the victim and determine his official cause of death.\nDuring their preliminary investigation, officers learned that the shots were fired from a vehicle. However, neither the vehicle's make nor model has been identified.\nAround the same time of the fatal shooting, police received a call of shots fired into a home on the 7900 block of Golden Avenue - just blocks away from where the man was mortally wounded, Ciaccia said. One bullet traveled through an upstairs window, shattering the glass.\nA 2-year-old girl suffered bruises to her chest during the shooting incident on Golden Avenue, Ciaccia said. She was taken to Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, where she is expected to be treated and released.\nCleveland detectives continue to work to determine if the two shootings are related, Ciaccia said.\nNo suspects have been identified, and no arrests have been made.\nIf you'd like to comment on this post, please visit the cleveland.com crime and courts comments section.\nGoogle Maps"}
