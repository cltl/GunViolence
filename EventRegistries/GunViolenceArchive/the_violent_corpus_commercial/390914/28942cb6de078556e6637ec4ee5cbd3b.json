Officers believe Wilkes shot and killed Charles Dean Thompson, a former Gaston County police officer who retired in 1995 after five years of service.\nThe shooting took place at a home on Balsam Court. Wilkes lived nearby on Greenwood Drive.\nWilkes also shot Debra Maness Childress, who fled from the home on Balsam Court and took refuge in a neighbor\u2019s house, police say.\nNeighbors in the quiet Gaston County community said they were settling in for the night when the gunfire began. Police said someone called police about 9:20 p.m., reporting a man in the home with a gun.\nThe caller said his father had been shot and that the suspect was still in the home. Several neighbors also called 911, saying there was a man walking around holding a shotgun and wearing a pistol.\nPolice, responding to a call of an active shooter, exchanged gunfire with Wilkes outside a house on Greenwood Drive. Two officers were shot, but neither had life-threatening injuries. The Gaston County Police Department had not released the officers\u2019 names. Childress\u2019 injuries also weren\u2019t life-threatening.\nPolice have not said why they believe Wilkes shot Thompson and Childress at the split-level tan house or why he later opened fire on officers. Thompson\u2019s daughter, Amy, said her father and Childress were friends and that Wilkes was an acquaintance.\nThompson \u201chad never had problems with (Childress or Wilkes),\u201d she said. \u201cI have no idea what transpired here. I don\u2019t know what happened. I don\u2019t know what set this man off.\u201d\nOfficers found Thompson\u2019s body inside the home on Balsam Court. They located the injured Childress at the neighbor\u2019s house.\nThe Gaston County police called in the SBI to investigate the officer-involved fatal shooting. Gaston County police will handle the other fatal shooting.\nThe officers involved have been placed on administrative leave with pay pending the results of the investigation. The Gaston County Police Professional Standard Unit is looking into whether all policies and procedures were followed.\nPolice ask that anyone with information about the case call them at 704-866-3320 or Crime Stoppers at 704-861-8000.\nUpdate: Police on officer involved shooting. @wsoctv pic.twitter.com/obeM937KlK\n&mdash; Alexa Ashwell (@AlexaWSOC9) August 9, 2015\nWootson: 704-358-5046"}
