The conditions and identities of the other four people weren't released.\nPolice said a number of people were standing outside the store when someone with a gun opened fire about 10 p.m. in the parking lot on North Lane near Pine Hills Road.\nAt least one of the victims was a teenager.\nA witness who didn't want to be named out of fear he'd be \"the next one shot,\" said he heard at least 10 gunshots. He was inside the Walgreens across the street and thought it was someone knocking on the glass doors.\n\"It was quick and constant, like pow, pow, pow,\" he said.\nLarry Mills, pastor at Mt. Sinai Missionary Baptist Church in Orlando, said the congregation held a discussion on Facebook Live Sunday afternoon calling for prayers for the city.\nWebb's wife, sister and sister-in-law attend Mt. Sinai, Mills said, and the church is trying to console them over his death. Mills said he didn't know Webb, but has called on the community to stand up and stop the violence.\nSince early October, eight people have died and at least 10 others were injured in 12 shootings in or near Pine Hills.\nMany of the cases remain unsolved, although investigators on Saturday announced the arrest of two teens accused in Wednesday's slaying of an innocent motorist outside a Citgo station at Silver Star and Pine Hills roads."}
