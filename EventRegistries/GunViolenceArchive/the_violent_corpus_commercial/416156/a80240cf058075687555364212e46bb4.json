She was later flown by air ambulance to an Indianapolis hospital.\nAuthorities were told the gunshot, apparently from a .22-caliber handgun, was accidentally fired by a 13-year-old boy, who had found the weapon and did not realize it was real.\nThe child's shooting came about 14 hours after city police, responding to a report of shots fired near the downtown McDonald's, found a 12-year-old boy carrying a .25-caliber handgun.\nThis story will be updated.\nContact news reporter Douglas Walker at (765) 213-5851.
