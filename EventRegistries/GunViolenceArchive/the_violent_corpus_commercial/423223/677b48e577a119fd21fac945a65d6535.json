One of those patients died in the emergency room.\nThree of the patients were taken to Sacred Heart Medical Center at Riverbend in Springfield for a \"higher level of care,\" said Gray. Two of them were in critical condition while another was listed as \"serious\" as of 9 a.m. Friday.\nSo far three of the patients that arrived at Mercy Medical have been treated and released. Three more are still receiving treatment; one of those victims might be released later in the day Friday.\nThe number of those injured in the shooting differs from what Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin reported on Thursday. He announced that there were seven victims wounded in the shooting.\nGray couldn't explain the discrepancy when KATU News asked him about the difference in Friday morning's news conference.\nMercy Medical Center will have a blood donation van in its west parking lot at noon Friday, in part a response to the overwhelming number of community members that arrived to donate blood after the shooting on Thursday."}
