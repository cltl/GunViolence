(KMOV.com) \u2013 A fourth man is facing charges in connection to a deadly shooting that took place along Interstate 270 in Hazelwood Sunday, February 21.\nJohn Howard Stith, 20, joins Tony Bailey, 21, Jerrod Corley, 24, and Leroy Coleman, 20, who were arrested and charged Friday, five days after Emma Wallace, 37, was shot and killed near North Lindbergh Boulevard. They face charges of first-degree murder, unlawful use of a weapon and multiple counts of assault and armed criminal action.\nWallace was inside a vehicle with three other people when the drive-by shooting happened around 2 a.m. Sunday. She had just been with friends at Jay's Classic Bar and on north Lindbergh before the shooting.\nPolice believe the shooting stemmed from a long running personal dispute.\n\"A confrontation, a disagreement. Something that was spurred from an event that happened between two people within the last year,\" said Hazelwood Police Chief Greg Hall.\nTwo other victims, a man and woman, were listed in serious condition, and another man was released from the hospital after the shooting.\nAuthorities believe Coleman carjacked a woman and three children on the Schnucks parking lot in Central West End only a few days before the shooting.\nTwo of the suspects are cooperating with officers, police said.\nCopyright 2016 KMOV (Meredith Corporation).
