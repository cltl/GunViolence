According to 11Alive Chattanooga sister station WRCB, eyewitnesses described the shooting as a murder-suicide, with Christopher Whitmore shooting and killing his wife, son and them himself.\nInvestigators determined Ball pulled up to the Shell station, and Whtimore drove up behind her.

Whitmore then pulled out a handgun and shot Grayden, who was sitting in the back seat.\nAfter killing his son, Whitmore shot Ball and then himself.\nThe Whitfield County Sheriff's Department told WRCB that Grayden was a student at Beaverdale Elementary School in Whitfield County.
