Officials said she hid the bodies in a shed owned by Weekly's landlord.\nWeekly's brothers cried and hugged one another after the judge denied bond for Cheyanne Jessie.\nRaw: Victims' family gets emotional after hearing\nRaw: Woman accused of killing daughter, father\nFamily members who spoke with Channel 9 on Wednesday said they hope Jessie gets the death penalty.\nPolk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Jessie got into an argument with Weekly about her new boyfriend at Weekly\u2019s home, on Drane Field Road in Lakeland.\n\"She was frustrated with the child and as a result, she didn't want the child to mess up the relationship she had with the boyfriend,\" Judd said.\nFamily members said Meredith was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and was recently put on medication.\n\"She was your friend one minute, and the next minute she could snap. But bipolarism is no excuse for murder,\" said Weekly's sister-in-law, Janice Weekly.\nInvestigators said Jessie\u2019s story changed several times after she reported the two missing. She first told authorities that the two were in Georgia, then claimed that she killed them in self-defense, deputies said.\n\"She supposedly gets the knife from her father after the father is fighting and slashing at her with the knife and accidentally stabs the 6-year-old. None of the evidence supports this,\" Judd said.\nDetectives said Jessie had no injuries to suggest that she had struggled with her father.\n\"He really cared for his granddaughter,\" said Mark Weekly's brother, Mike Weekly. \"I don't believe he would ever hurt her. It's terrible that this had to happen.\"\n\"I have no idea why anyone would do anything like that, even their 6-year old daughter,\" said Mark Weekly's niece, Crystal Stahl. \"I mean, it's just a disgusting thing anyone could do to any child or even their father.\"\n\"She had planned this. She had the furniture covered, is what we heard,\" said Mark Weekly's sister-in-law, Gaye Weekly. \"I want her to have to pay for it. I mean, I don't want her getting off with a lawyer putting her in a mental institution, because this is premeditated. Mental illness you don't plan out something, you just act. She planned this out.\"\nDeputies serving a search warrant said they found bloodstained floors and furniture with slash marks.\nhttp://twitter.com/TBarberWFTV/status/628257260205117440\nJudd said the house reeked of a foul odor, and Jessie claimed that there had been a dead raccoon under her porch.\n\"Nothing is more horrific than the murder of a child, except when it\u2019s done by a parent,\" Judd said.\nJudd said a gun and a knife were used in the killings, but they are waiting for the results of autopsies to determine how Mark Weekly and Meredith died.\n\"This is the face and (these are) the eyes of a cold-blooded murderer that not only murdered them on the 18th of July, but left them in the residence for many days,\" Judd said.\nA friend of Mark Weekly\u2019s said Weekly helped take care of Jessie's daughter.\n\"He would rather you take his life than mess with that baby,\" Fred Poore Jr. said."}
