A beautiful child, 6 years old, was viciously murdered by her mother. The question is: did she first witness the vicious murder of her grandfather?\" Judd said.\nInvestigators allege Jessie shot and stabbed her father and daughter July 18 after she got into an argument with her father over her boyfriend. She moved them to the shed four days later, they said.\nA couple who said they know the family claimed Jessie often complained about her daughter.\n\"I know she didn't like her daughter too much. I do know that. Cause she says she's always in trouble. She's a handful. She screams and shouts at her. But she don't do that with her granddad,\" Ruby Poore said.\nThe sheriff said Jessie claimed she killed her father in self-defense during their argument and that the child was caught in the middle.
