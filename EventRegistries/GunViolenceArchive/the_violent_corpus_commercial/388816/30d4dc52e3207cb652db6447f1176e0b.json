Jadurius was unresponsive at that point, and rescue workers were unable to resuscitate him.\nWillie J. Wilkinson Jr., 22, was taken into custody on the scene and charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He is also being held on a warrant for probation violation through the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Further charges are possible, depending on what the investigation turns up.\n\"It was determined that Wilkinson was in possession of the firearm prior to the incident,\" Boyte's statement reads.\nWilkinson had been staying at the home where the incident took place for about two weeks, police said. Police Chief Scott McKenzie said the two are somehow related, but are not father and son.\nPittman said at this point it's still not clear if the shooting was intentional or accidental. McKenzie said investigators are talking to witnesses and are not far from determining if further charges will be pressed.\nWilkinson was sentenced to three years probation on arson and five years probation on grand larceny earlier this year. He did not serve any time on either charge, said MDOC spokeswoman Grace Fisher.\nNo bond has been set.\n(This story has been edited to reflect Jadurius' name is Wilkinson, not Wilkerson as we were first told.)"}
