He was questioned and released by homicide investigators after he was located.\nThe case is being turned over to the District Attorney's office for review. Investigators recovered the weapon from the teenager. It's believed to have been stolen.\nAs many as a half dozen teenagers were in the house when the shooting happened. They were questioned and released as well.\nThe victim was shot in the head, and was flown by Life Flight to Memorial Hermann Hospital. We're told he was put on life support, because the family may be considering organ donation.\nThe bullet that was fired, according to neighbors, went through the wall of the house and broke a window in a house next door. That's where the bullet was recovered.\nA Sheriff's homicide investigator says there's evidence to suggest the teenagers had been smoking pot before the shooting."}
