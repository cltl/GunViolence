Prosecutors say that by leaving a gun within reach of his son, Holzwarth engaged in reckless conduct that created a substantial risk to the boy.\nThe boy shot himself in the mouth in November. The bullet lodged in the boy's upper palate and caused significant damage that required surgery.\nHolzwarth doesn't have any prior criminal history. Prosecutors are not expected to request bail when he is arraigned next month. They do plan to ask that Holzwarth not have any contact with his son."}
