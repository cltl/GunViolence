He was taken in serious condition to Comer Children\u2019s Hospital.\nA 28-year-old woman also suffered a gunshot wound to the head in the shooting, police said. She was lying in her bed inside her home nearby when a bullet came through the window, then the wall, and she was struck. She was taken in good condition to Stroger Hospital.\nPolice said neither victim was the intended target. The shooters were traveling in a four-door, dark-color vehicle and opened fire on a crowd that had gathered in the courtyard of the housing complex on that block.\nThe shooting occurred in a part of Woodlawn known as \u201cO Block.\u201d A Chicago Sun-Times analysis in November 2014 found that O Block \u2014 which derives its nickname from the 2011 murder of 20-year-old Odee Perry \u2014 saw 19 shootings between June 2011 and June 2014, more than any other block in the city.\nPastor Corey Brooks, of the New Beginnings Church of Chicago, tweeted early Wednesday that a $10,000 reward was offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the shooter."}
