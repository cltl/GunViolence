At the apartment complex, police found a man who had been shot. His injuries were treated and he has been released from the hospital.\nPolice said Diaz-Perez and Estrada told detectives they had been walking on Central Park Lane when the man was shot, but they were unable to relay any details about the incident and said they did not hear or see anything prior to the gunshot.\nBoth men gave the same vague account, according to the police report, and the person who was shot offered nearly the same story while being interviewed at the hospital.\nDetectives said they found a bullet hole inside the apartment and evidence indicated that the men were lying about what happened.\nAccording to the police report, Estrada eventually admitted to police that he was sitting on the bed in the bedroom playing with a gun when it went off, striking the other man in the face.\nFiling a false report to a police officer is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine."}
