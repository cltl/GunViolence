Police said the investigation is continuing.\nThe bowling alley was hosting Soul Bowl, an event for college-age people. There were about 160 people at the party, which featured a disc jockey.\nA group of people confronted others who were bowling, and alley employees decided to end the event after the confrontation got physical, Danny Collins, president of Collins Bowling Centers, said at the time. The shooting started as they were getting everybody out of the building.\nAt the time, police said investigators were struggling to get a handle on what happened because there were so many witnesses. One of the victims who was wounded told the Herald-Leader in April that the scene was a \"war zone\" and a \"battlefield,\" with more than one person shooting.\nWhen Webb was charged, he was already in the Fayette County Detention Center.\nHe had been arrested May 22 on several drug charges including trafficking in cocaine, according to jail officials.\nCan you help?\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the Lexington Division of Police.
