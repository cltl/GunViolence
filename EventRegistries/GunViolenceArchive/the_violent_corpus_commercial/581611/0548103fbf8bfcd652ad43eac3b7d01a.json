He claims he did it in self-defense because they were trying to attack him with knives.\n\"There's just no way that he could feel so threatened to carry out such an action to his wife and his daughter,\" said Desmond Bertrand, a relative. \"And then the range and where she was shot, there's just no way.\"\nAriel died at the scene. Her mother was rushed to the hospital with a gunshot wound to the head where she later died.\nThe father, 43, was taken into custody for questioning.\nCharges have not been filed in the case, but the investigation is ongoing. Police confirm they'd been called to the house before -- most recently on an assault allegation in April -- but no charges were filed in those cases.\n\"They were together, but separate, their family was coming back together, working on issues,\" Bertrand said.\nNeighbors were shocked.\n\"It's breaking my heart, it's really sad, it almost sounds unreal,\" said Gilbert Garcia.\n\"They seemed to be really nice people, all of them, every time i would see them, they would wave at me,\" said Perry Green.\nHPD asked for anyone with information to call homicide investigators at 713-308-3600 or Houston Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.\n(\u00a9 2017 KHOU)"}
