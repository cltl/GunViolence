Several minutes later, the clip shows police cars arriving on the scene.\nThe house where two men and their girlfriends were gunned down is outside the frame so couldn\u2019t be seen and the make of car is not clear in the nighttime shot. The business owner said police didn\u2019t want the footage released at this point.\nA next-door neighbor called police after hearing multiple gunshots, police said.\nWhen officers arrived, they were able to see four people \u2014 two women and two men \u2014 shot in the residence, said Melissa Bujeda, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nThree died at the scene and one was transported to a nearby hospital, where she died.\n\u201cWe have an individual or individuals at large who shot and killed four people,\u201d Bujeda said.\nThe victims were identified as 25-year-old Derek L. Williams of the home, 27-year-old Gontrell M. Hagans of Timuquana Avenue and sisters Keshell L. and Keyonna S. Brown, 21 and 22, both of West 11th Street.\nPolice said the shooting happened inside the house in the 1100 block and is one of three houses on the street that is a short block off Cassat Avenue in Murray Hill.\nFriday morning, about three dozen people gathered at the end of Randolph where a police line was established. Some people in the area said the home often had several people coming and going throughout the day. According to calls for police service to the address, it was not a problem home, Chief Annie Smith said.\nJohnny Hutchinson said one of the victims was his nephew, who he said had been shot once in the past.\nHutchinson said he tried to mentor the younger man who he feared was living dangerously.\n\u201cI\u2019d just tell him it\u2019s not working,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people just live the life and don\u2019t know anything else.\u201d\nBujeda urged anyone with information to call the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\u201cWe want someone to step forward,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a killer on the loose.\u201d\nAnyone with information can contact the Sheriff\u2019s Office at (904) 630-0500 or First Coast Crime Stoppers at (866) 845-8477 (845-TIPS) to remain anonymous and be eligible for rewards.
