(AP) Authorities say four people were shot during a party at a hotel in the Denver suburb of Wheat Ridge.\nPolice spokesman John Romero says officers were called to a Howard Johnson hotel at about 1:40 a.m. Sunday after multiple reports that someone had opened fire on the party. Officers arrived to find partygoers running from the scene, and at least one of the victims was taken to the hospital in a private vehicle.\nRomero did not know what kind of gun was used, the size of the party or the conditions of the victims. He says \"the nature of the scene being so chaotic, there are a lot of differing opinions on who the suspect is.\"\nInvestigators believe only one gunman was involved."}
