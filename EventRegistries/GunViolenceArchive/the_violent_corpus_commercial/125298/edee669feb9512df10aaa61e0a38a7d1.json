When he went to investigate, he found his 3-year-old grandson, shot in the head.\n\u201cWe had a bad tragedy. He shot himself,\u201d McDuffie said Monday. \u201cWhen I went in the room, there was the little boy.\u201d\nThe shooting was reported about 1:20 p.m. in the 700 block of Glasgow Road, near Moores Chapel Road in northwest Charlotte. The boy was taken to Carolinas Medical Center and pronounced dead, police said. Officials did not give his name, but McDuffie identified him as Anthony. Police do not believe foul play was involved.\nAnthony\u2019s father, who is also named Anthony, said Monday that shortly before the shooting, he had left to run an errand.\n\u201cI was only gone 20 minutes,\u201d the father said through tears. \u201cHe said, \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019ll be right back, son.\u2019 \u201d\nIn a frantic three-minute 911 call released by police Monday, an unidentified female begs for paramedics to come to the house as soon as possible.\nWhen the dispatcher asks what happened, she says repeatedly, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\nMcDuffie said Anthony visited every other Sunday. McDuffie said he looked forward to the visits and enjoyed cooking for 3-year-old Anthony and his other grandchildren.\nMcDuffie said that he has a concealed weapon permit but that he keeps his gun hidden. As of Monday afternoon, police had not said whose gun was used in the shooting.\nAt the time of the shooting, McDuffie said several other family members were also in the house, including one of his sons and another grandchild. His wife was at work, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to even talk on the phone to anybody,\u201d McDuffie said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really bad.\u201d"}
