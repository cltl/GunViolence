Jaehnert said she heard four gunshots.\nThe shootings occurred at 10:45 p.m. on Morgan Avenue N. about a block north of the precinct station.\nThe attackers fled. No arrests had been made by midnight Monday. Police said via their Twitter feed that they are searching for three white male suspects.\nThe gunshot victims were taken to North Memorial Medical Center and Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC), deputy police chief Medaria Arradondo said at the scene.\nA person at the scene said one of the victims had been shot in the stomach, and was undergoing surgery overnight at HCMC.\nJie Wronski-Riley said angry protesters moved the men away from the encampment at the police station. Wronski-Riley heard what sounded like firecrackers and thought, \u201csurely they\u2019re not shooting human beings.\u201d Two young black men on either side of him were hit, one in the back and leg, the other in the arm.\nAt least two of the three men who had been taunting protesters were firing guns, said Wronski-Riley, who described the incident as \u201creally chaotic, really fast.\u201d\n\u201cI am obviously appalled that white supremacists would open fire on nonviolent, peaceful protesters,\u201d said Nekima Levy-Pounds, president of the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP, who returned to the site after the shootings.\nThe protesters, angry over the fatal police shooting of 24-year-old Jamar Clark on Nov. 15, have maintained a presence outside the police station ever since.\nEddie Sutton, Jamar\u2019s brother, issued this statement early Tuesday morning in response to the shootings:\n\u201cThank you to the community for the incredible support you have shown for our family in this difficult time. We appreciate Black Lives Matter for holding it down and keeping the protests peaceful. But in light of tonight\u2019s shootings, the family feels out of imminent concern for the safety of the occupiers, we must get the occupation of the 4th precinct ended and onto the next step.\u201d\nMARY LYNN SMITH and CLAUDE PECK"}
