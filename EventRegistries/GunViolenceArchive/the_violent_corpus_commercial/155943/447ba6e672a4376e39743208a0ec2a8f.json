Base Line.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so violent you don\u2019t even feel safe in your own home,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cI was safer in Iraq than I am here. It\u2019s time to rethink my options and get out of Dodge.\u201d\nThe shooting, which also seriously injured four others, took place shortly after 11 p.m., police Lt. Rich Lawhead said.\nThe smoke shop is in a small strip mall on the corner of Base Line and Waterman Avenue, police said. Hunt was found on the sidewalk in front of the business.\nThree of the victims were found inside the smoke shop and the other was found behind the smoke shop near Stater Bros. Market, police said.\nAuthorities believe he collapsed running away from the shooting.\nThree employees of the smoke shop were inside the business as the barrage of gunfire found its way inside the shop, but they took cover when bullets began to fly and were unharmed, police at the scene said.\nPolice believe the motive behind the shooting was gang and/or drug-related. Authorities are searching for two men they believe are suspected of shooting the five people.\nLike Gomez, residents of the neighboring Waterman Gardens housing project say they heard the shots ring out.\n\u201cI was sitting in front of my home when it sounded like I was back in Iraq,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cIt just sounded like the gunfire wouldn\u2019t stop. I ran into my home.\u201d\nAfter the shooting, more than 20 yellow markers were placed throughout the parking lot of the strip mall showing where bullet casings landed after being ejected by a handgun.\nPolice responded to a shooting in the same area just the night before.\nShortly after 11 p.m., 9-1-1 received multiple-shots-fired calls from a Jack in the Box restaurant at 303 East Base Line, saying men were shooting at each other. One group was firing their guns from Masters Donuts at 306 East Base Line toward the Jack in the Box and the other from the Jack in the Box toward the doughnut shop, police said.\nNobody was hurt in that shooting.\n\u201cI watched these knuckleheads shooting at each other from across the street Sunday,\u201d 87-year-old San Bernardino resident Michael Johnson said. \u201cThis has to be a retaliation from that.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHowever, even though residents of Waterman Gardens believe the two shootings are related, police say no.\n\u201cThere is no evidence that the two shooting are related,\u201d police Sgt. Gary Robertson said.\nAnyone with information on the incident is asked to contact Detective Bill Flesher at 909-384-5655 or Sgt. Gary Robertson at 909-841-5361."}
