He ended up returning home the same night. The mother told police she made her son get into her car and take her to the house of the son\u2019s girlfriend, where he ran to after running away from home.\nShe then told police while they were in the car, her son got upset and started hitting her. The teen tried to get out of the car when his mother pulled out a handgun, pointed it at him, and shot him.\nShe told police she wanted to scare him but she did not intend to pull the trigger and shoot him.\nMark Stamps, who lives nearby, heard the incident unfolding and came out to see what was going on.\n\"His shoulder...I guess his shoulder was hurting and he was crying,\" Stamps said. \"She was like, 'Get in the car.' To me, she should get charged for that, because you don't scare a child with a gun. You don't point a gun at a child at all, really. Like, that's a charge right there. You shouldn't do that.\"\nAfter the shooting, the two drove home to get into the boy's brother's car and he drove both of them to St. Francis Hospital.\nThe teen's condition is currently unknown.\nGray faces one count of aggravated assault/domestic violence.\nCopyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.
