Alexis Widerholt told the dispatcher that her 5-year-old son shot her 9-month-old son in the head with a paintball gun. When emergency crews arrived at the home in Elmo, Missouri., it was determined the baby was shot in the head with a .22-caliber magnum revolver.\n\"I just happened to be standing by and answered the phone,\" Sheriff Darren White said. \"The lady on the other end was very frantic and said that she needed an ambulance at her home in Elmo.\"\n\"It's a very traumatizing time, and we want to wish our friends the deepest condolences,\" family friend Mike Wiederholt said.\nThe baby was taken via air ambulance to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, where he was pronounced dead.\n\"It takes a little bit out of you to find out that someone you knew is now gone in such a tragic accident,\" Wiederholt said.\n\"We got some guys that work here that have little kids of their own,\" White said. \"This kind of hits home with them, too. They take it personally.\"\nFoul play is not suspected, and officials said it appears the shooting was accidental.\n\"We are big supporters of firearms around here,\" White said. \"We live in a rural area. We have a lot of people who own weapons. They hunt. They shoot. Most people are very safe with them, and this is one of those cases where everything went together in the wrong way.\""}
