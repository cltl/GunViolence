The wound was not life-threatening, and the unidentified victim was treated at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, police said.\n\"The victim initially reported that he was sitting on his porch when he was shot by an unknown masked suspect who then ran off,\" police said in a statement Sunday.

Investigators determined both were with the victim when he was shot.\n\"They were handling a handgun that the two had brought with them,\" police said. \"The gun discharged, striking the victim in the chest. The two fled the residence with the gun prior to police arrival.\"\nPolice said they found two handguns in Cercone's vehicle, which was in a nearby parking lot.\nCercone was held on $50,000 bail in Burlington County Jail after police charged him with weapons possession offenses. The Trenton teen was held in Burlington County Juvenile Detention Center on charges of aggravated assault, possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose and unlawful possession of a firearm.\nAuthorities said no one else was injured in the incident."}
