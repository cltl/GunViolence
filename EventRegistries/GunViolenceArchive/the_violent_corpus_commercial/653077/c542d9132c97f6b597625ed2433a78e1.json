The victims range in age from 23-63 years old.\n\"One of the six victims sustained a life-threatening gunshot wound to the head,\" said NOPD Spokesperson Tyler Gamble in an email. That man is listed in critical condition, according to the NOPD. The five other victims have injuries that are not life-threatening.\nThat victim, a 63-year-old Earnest McKnight, later died, according to the Orleans Parish Coroner's Office\nGamble added the full count of victims was not immediately available Sunday night because about half of the victims were taken to different hospitals via private conveyance.\nAuthorities said they believe the suspect intended to shoot someone who was at the location and struck several bystanders in the process.\n\"I think this is the largest mass shooting we've had in the city this year, with six people shot,\" said NOPD Superintendent Michael Harrison. \"We're looking into how this may be connected to any other crimes, any other acts of violence that have taken place in that area.\"\nHarrison added police are also looking to see if there is any gang-related connections to Sunday's shooting.\nPolice are still looking for video surveillance and a suspect.\nAnyone with information about this shooting is asked to call Crimestoppers at (504) 822-1111.\nNOPD Supt.
