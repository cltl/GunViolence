Abdi is in the black hat.\nPolice are also trying to identify the man in the middle of the picture. Police have not called him a person of interest and KSAT has chosen to blur his face unless police say he is a person of interest or suspect in the shooting.\nThe man on the right, Murjan Abdi, has been arrested and charged with aggravated robbery in connection to the shooting.\nPolice said they believe the incident began when two men backed their car into another vehicle parked in a driveway. The two men argued with the homeowner police said, before showing off their guns and firing multiple times, hitting both the man and the home.\nThe 5-year-old girl was sleeping in a front room when one of the rounds hit her in the head, police said.\nFollowing the shooting one of the assailants broke out the front window and crawled into the house before unlocking the front door and fleeing, police said.\nCopyright 2016 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}
