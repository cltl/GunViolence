An 11-year-old boy taken to Children Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC also improved, the chief said.\nA 16-year-old boy also is being treated at Mercy for nonlife-threatening injuries and an adult was treated at the scene. Police aren\u2019t releasing their identities.\nChief Jozwick said police still don\u2019t have a motive for the shootings, which occurred about 7 p.m. near a Rite Aid pharmacy.\nThe three boys were shot on a set of steps near the store, and the adult was shot on the opposite side of the street. Police found multiple shell casings at the scene.\nThe adult victim told police that the driver and front-seat passenger of a dark-colored car were shooting out of both sides of the vehicle as they headed north on Amanda.\nA woman who would identify herself only as Lauren L. said she had stepped out of the Rite Aid, where she works, to smoke a cigarette when she heard about seven gunshots. A bullet whizzed by her head and struck one of the drugstore\u2019s glass doors, shattering part of it, and she dropped to the ground.\n\u201cIt wasn't until I watched the tape that I realized how serious it really was,\u201d she said, referring to the store\u2019s video surveillance system.\nKurt Miller, 25, whose family owns a hardware store near the scene, said he heard \u201cquite a few\u201d gunshots and locked himself inside the store.\n\u201cBefore you even realized it started, it was over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d\nHalley White, 19, who recently moved to the area and was walking near the crime scene, said the gunfire was \u201cscary.\u201d\n\u201cThis makes me want to go home and not walk around anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to be scared to leave our homes and walk down a main street.\u201d\nAllegheny County police also were investigating.\nMadasyn Czebiniak: mczebiniak@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1269."}
