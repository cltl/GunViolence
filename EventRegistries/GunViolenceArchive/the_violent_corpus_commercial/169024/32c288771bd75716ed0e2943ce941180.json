Michael Kash said.\nPolice arrived on the scene shortly after receiving a call and discovered a black male, estimated to be in his 40s, with wounds that were described as \"ricochet injures,\" Kash said. His name and age were not immediately available, he said.\nFour additional victims - three men and a woman - were found to be at the Maury Regional Medical Center emergency room a short time later, Kash said.\n\"We got a call that there were four more (victims) at the ER with gunshot injuries,\" Kash said. \"We don't know the motivation. It's still an ongoing investigation.\"\nAubrey Amos, born in 1970, and Shawn Duncan, born in 1973, were admitted to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Kash said.\nErica Symlar, born in 1973, and Christopher Davis, who was described as being in his 40s, were treated and released at MRMC with minor bullet wounds, Kash said.\nKash said he doesn't believe the Down Low Restaurant was open at the time of the shootings.

The matter remains under investigation, Kash said.\nA resident who lives on Bridge Street behind the Down Low Restaurant said she was not aware of the shooting near her home.

I hate to hear about anything happening like that.\""}
