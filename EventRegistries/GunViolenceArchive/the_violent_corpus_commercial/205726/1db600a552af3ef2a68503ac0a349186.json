Jake Smith said the incident happened at an apartment at 6505 Bannor Lane. Authorities arrived on the scene around 5:24 p.m. and found five people shot in what they said appears to be a murder-suicide.\nAccording to police, 30-year-old Brandon McLean shot his 13-year-old niece Kayla Serrano and his 19-year-old nephew, Andre McLean to death inside the apartment. Investigators said McLean also shot and seriously wounded his mother, 57-year-old Betty McLean and her sister, 52-year-old Charlotte Longnecker. Both are hospitalized in serious but stable condition.\nIt is not yet clear what led to the shooting. It was an emotional scene Tuesday evening as friends and family tried to make sense of what happened -- something that even police said they cannot determine at this point.\nWe know that Brandon had been in and out of the home prior to the shooting,\" said Smith. \"We do believe that he had been staying here prior to the shooting. The exact circumstances that led up to the shooting, we can't say precisely at this point.\"\nLIKE 11Alive's Facebook page to get the latest breaking news and weather alerts, plus discuss trending topics!\nDownload the 11Alive News app to get the latest news while you're on the go!
