LOUIS COUNTY \u2022 A Flordell Hills man was charged Monday with assault in what police called an accidental shooting of his 14-year-old nephew at the Sugar Pines apartments in north St. Louis County.\nJordon L. Henderson, 20, of the 7000 block of Roslyn Drive, was charged with second-degree assault. His first name is spelled Jordan in some records. He was jailed on a $50,000 cash-only bail.\nThe shooting was about 7:45 p.m. Sunday in the 3500 block of Sugar Crest Drive. Charges say Henderson \"playfully pointed a handgun at victim and pulled the trigger multiple times without the gun going off.\" At one point while pulling the trigger, however, the gun fired and the boy was hit once in the abdomen.\nThe boy, identified in court documents by initials D.H., was taken to a hospital and is expected to survive. Authorities initially said he was 13 but now say he is 14.\nCharges say Henderson admitted shooting his nephew."}
