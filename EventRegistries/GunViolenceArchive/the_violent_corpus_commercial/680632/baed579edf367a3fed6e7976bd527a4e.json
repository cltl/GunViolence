Can\u2019t believe it. Still don\u2019t. Numb.\"\nNickelson described Hoke as \"real out going. Got to be outside. He loved people. He loves to protect someone. He\u2019s a protector and we always \u2013 I call him daddy because he thinks he\u2019s our dad. Him and his big brother are best friends.\"\nHis grandmother said Hoke and his family moved from Virginia to Charlotte over the summer.

That\u2019s it\" said his grandmother. \"We\u2019re going to miss him. We\u2019re going to miss him.
