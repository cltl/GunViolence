He was also sentenced on child abuse and several weapons charges. Those sentences, ranging up to 50 years, will run concurrently with the manslaughter conviction. Head will get 116 days credit for time already served.\nThe boy was shot to death by his sister when she found a loaded shotgun in the man\u2019s home last year. It was originally reported that the boy shot himself.\nHead was convicted for the shooting by a jury July 7.\nHead\u2019s son, Daylen Head, was shot to death with a sawed-off shotgun in November at the father\u2019s home in the 6600 block of Barton, on the west side. A felon, Head also violated the law because he was not legally allowed to own a gun.\nThe boy\u2019s 8-year-old sister found the shotgun in an unlocked closet and fired the loaded weapon, allegedly mimicking a video game, striking her brother in the head. She took the stand during the trial to testify about the shooting.\nDuring her victim-impact statement Monday, the boy\u2019s mother, Abbey, told Head that although her son\u2019s death was an accident \u201cit very well could have been prevented.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not here for closure because I know it\u2019s something I\u2019m not going to get,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said through tears. \u201cMy son is gone. My children will never be the same.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cI\u2019ve tried and I prayed and I continue to try and pray so I can forgive you, but right now I\u2019m not there.\u201d\nShe criticized Head for \u201cnot reaching out\u201d and comforting his children.\nHead cried and told Hathaway \u201cbad things do happen on some of the most beautiful days.\u201d\n\u201cI know I was doing my job as a father,\u201d Head told the judge, before he begged her for leniency and pleading with her not to take \u201cme away from my babies for a long time.\u201d\nHathaway told Head \u201cyou are still blaming your daughter\u201d for the incident.\nHead\u2019s brother Reginald called the sentence \u201charsh\u201d given that the shooting was an accident.\n\u201cI knew he was going to get some time but not that much time,\u201d Reginald Head said following the sentencing, in which family members cried over the loss of the child and the father\u2019s lengthy prison sentence. \u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d\nReginald Head said his brother tried to plead guilty in a plea deal that would have sent him away for 15 years but the deal fell apart.\nAssistant Wayne County Prosecutor Michael Woodyard, called the case one \u201cthat is exceptionally tragic\u201d and \u201can unspeakable tragedy.\u201d\nHead\u2019s prior criminal record dates back to 1989, and includes charges for extortion, stalking, possession of a concealed weapon, and the delivery and manufacture of cocaine in Wayne County. A 2006 arson case against Head was dismissed.\nbwilliams@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2027"}
