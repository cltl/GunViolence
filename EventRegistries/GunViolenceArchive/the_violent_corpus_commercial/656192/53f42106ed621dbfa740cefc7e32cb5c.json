Amyira lived in Louisiana with Johnson most of the year, she said by phone.\nJohnson became concerned after receiving a phone call from Tarel Felder.\n\"He was trying to get me to come out there, to come back out there to move and live with them. I told him, 'No,' Johnson said. \"He was telling me he was going to keep my baby away from me, he told me she wasn't going to come back.\"\nNeighbors were awakened by the flood of emergency vehicles that descended on the Plantation Lakes Subdivision late Thursday night.\n\"[This] neighborhood is a very quiet neighborhood. You wouldn't expect nothing like that to happen,\" Don Franklin said.\nA GoFundMe account has been set-up to help Amyira's mother in funeral expenses.\n\"I want to bring her back home,\" Johnson said.\n2016 Click2Houston/KPRC2"}
