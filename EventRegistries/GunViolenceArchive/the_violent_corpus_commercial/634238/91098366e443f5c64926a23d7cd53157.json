(WFSB) -\nHamden police are still searching for the suspect they believe is responsible for an early Saturday morning shooting.\nThat shooting broke Saturday at Highwood Bar and Grill around 1:30 a.m.\nResponders found one male, who was shot twice in the legs and two female victims, who were also shot once in the legs inside the bar. Police said the victims were transported to Yale New Haven Hospital where they were treated for non life-threatening injuries.\nA neighbor nearby, Carletha Bynes told Eyewitness News that she heard the gunshots ring out, \"I was sitting there and I had just walked in the house. And two minutes later, I heard three gunshots.\"\nA fourth victim was grazed by a bullet but walked away from the scene, according to police.\n\"People were running to their cars and they were leaving the bar,\" said Bynes. \"It was like, really crazy.\"\nPolice on patrol said the suspect, who they describe is a black male who is 5'10 and around 210 lbs, took off running toward Morse St.\nThey believe he has glasses and was wearing a red, white, and black plaid shirt with a fisherman hat at the time of the shooting.\nBynes told Eyewitness News that the neighborhood was once quiet and safe, but now she hopes that going forward there will be extra security.\n\"I hope that there's more cops around the area to secure the area because sometimes I have my grandson on my porch with me, and it's kind of scary.\"\nAnyone with information is urged to contact Hamden Police Department at 203-230-4000.\nCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).
