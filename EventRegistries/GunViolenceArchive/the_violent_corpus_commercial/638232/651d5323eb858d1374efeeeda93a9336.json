Although none of the teens fired the shot that killed Marquis Mullins, they all face felony murder charges because he died during the alleged commission of a felony.\nFormer Tulsa Police Department homicide detective Matt Frazier testified Thursday that Smith admitted in an interview to being at the scene on the day of the shooting. Frazier said Smith told him that Ross, alleged to be a Hoover Crips member, had a \u201cbeef\u201d with the Bloods gang and wanted to \u201cget back\u201d at a group of people for a shots-fired incident at Ross\u2019 mother\u2019s home.\nSmith, according to Frazier, was with Deonta Mullins and Ross when they picked up Marquis Mullins from school. Frazier said Smith told him they were driving through a neighborhood when they saw two people, ages 16 and 19, who were the apparent subjects of Ross\u2019 anger and subsequently opened fire on them from their vehicle. A third person fired back at the vehicle as it fled, police say, striking Marquis Mullins in the back. He died at Saint Francis Hospital.\nRoderick Harbin, the man believed to have fired the fatal shot, has not been charged in the case. Sgt. Dave Walker has said Harbin gave detectives a \u201cplausible explanation\u201d as to why he shot at the vehicle.\nHarbin also testified during Thursday\u2019s preliminary hearing, later prompting Assistant District Attorney Isaac Shields to say Harbin had the right to defend himself in the matter.\nDefense attorney Brian Boeheim argued for Keeley to merge the two vehicle-related counts and said he doesn\u2019t think the shootings should be counted as one incident, as Harbin and the others fired as the vehicle was fleeing the area.\nBoeheim additionally questioned the state\u2019s witnesses on how they determined that Smith is a gang member and said the state didn\u2019t prove there was intent to kill anyone.\nBut Shields said Marquis Mullins\u2019 death is the result of \u201ca series of events set in motion by the defendants,\u201d and he called it a \u201cgang drive-by shooting of other gang members.\u201d\nDeonta Mullins, Ross and Smith will appear Jan. 3 for trial court arraignment before District Judge Sharon Holmes."}
