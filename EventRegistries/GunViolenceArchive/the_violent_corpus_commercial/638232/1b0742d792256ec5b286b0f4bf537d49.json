But 17-year-old Marquiss Mullins, who was also participating in the drive-by, was fatally shot when a man they were shooting at shot back at the SUV they were in, according to Tulsa police homicide Sgt. Dave Walker.\nMarquiss Mullins and Deonta Mullins are brothers, Walker said. Deonta Mullins was driving the vehicle at the time of the shooting.\nThe three men were each charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of use of a vehicle in discharge of a weapon, according to court documents.\nRoss was additionally charged on one count of possessing a firearm after juvenile adjudication, court documents show.\nThe victim\u2019s brother was interviewed on the night of the shooting, Walker said, but his name was withheld from the public as a suspect in the murder in concern for the suspect\u2019s well-being, Walker said.\n\u201cHis brother was just killed,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe wanted to at least give him the benefit of the doubt. If we put him in jail he wouldn\u2019t be able to attend the funeral, be with family, so it was just sort of a humanitarian type thing.\u201d\nRoss and Smith were arrested and booked into the Tulsa Jail on Aug. 24 and are being held without bond, according to online jail records. Tulsa police have not received an arrest warrant for Deonta Mullins yet, Walker said."}
