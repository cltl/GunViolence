Investigators had offered a reward earlier that evening of up to $5,000 for information leading to his arrest, Arkansas Online previously reported. Police thanked the community for the tips they received over the past week.\nHarris originally faced a capital-murder charge after Tyler Donaldson, 23, died Sunday from injuries he sustained during the shooting, but it was changed to first-degree murder. Harris was also wanted on four counts of first-degree battery.\nPolice had previously arrested Anthony Camden, 23, the other man they say shot five people, on five counts of first-degree battery, as reported by the Hot Springs Sentinel-Record. One of Camden's charges was also changed to first-degree murder after Donaldson died.\nAn argument about money between one of the victims, a 17-year-old boy, and Camden led to the shooting, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette previously reported.\nRead Friday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details."}
