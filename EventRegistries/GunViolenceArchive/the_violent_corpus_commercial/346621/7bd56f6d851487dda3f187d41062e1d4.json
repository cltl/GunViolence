I have to be strong for you. That\u2019s your daughter, that\u2019s my granddaughter,\u201d an older man yelled at his son outside the hospital.\nMakayla\u2019s father shot back, \u201cThey can\u2019t make me walk upstairs and say goodbye to my first daughter. I didn\u2019t come out here to say goodbye.\u201d\nOthers also started arguing, and police were eventually called to calm the group of about 15 relatives.\nThere was still confusion about what exactly happened to the little girl.\nCops said they believe Makayla accidentally shot herself in a second-floor apartment shortly after 10:30 p.m.\nUpstairs neighbor Christyl Banks said she \u201csaw people arguing outside\u201d before hearing the crack of a gunshot. Then, she said, \u201cI heard people screaming and running inside. It was surprising.\u201d\nAnother neighbor told the Daily News on Monday that the girl\u2019s mother, identified by friends as Tantania Manners, was outside talking to friends on Walnut St. The girl\u2019s aunt was in the apartment with Makayla, according to the neighbor.\nPolice said they found a semiautomatic handgun inside the apartment, and they\u2019re \u201cinvestigating the origin of the weapon.\u201d\nThe mom, 22, could not be reached for comment.\nOn her Facebook page, she lists her occupation as \u201cFull-time mommy :).\u201d\nThe page is filled with pictures of her adorable daughter, including one photo of Makayla in what appears to be a Catholic school uniform.\nIn others, she\u2019s mugging for the camera with her mom, and in one, she\u2019s cradling a cat. \u201cMother Makayla,\u201d the caption said.\nTo view this page ensure that Adobe Flash Player version 10.2.0 or greater is installed.\nThe girl\u2019s prognosis is unclear. A family friend told The News on Monday night that she was \u201cvery responsive\u201d after the shooting.\n\u201cShe was squeezing my hand and I was talking to her. She had one eye open,\u201d said the friend, a neighbor who declined to give her name.\n\u201cShe is a brilliant little girl,\u201d she added.\nOutside of the hospital Tuesday, the girl\u2019s grandfather admitted to family friends that he was having problems following his own advice and staying strong.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine when I\u2019m here but I can\u2019t see her. I can\u2019t see her like that,\u201d he said.\nNo charges have been filed in the case.\nYonkers police said the investigation \u201cis active and ongoing,\u201d and they ask anyone with information to contact the Detective Division at (914) 377-7724.\nAll calls will be kept confidential."}
