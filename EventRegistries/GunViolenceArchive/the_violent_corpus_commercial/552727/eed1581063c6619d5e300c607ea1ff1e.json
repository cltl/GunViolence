Detectives said at least 30 rounds were fired into the home by an undetermined number of individuals, who arrived and left in an unknown vehicle. At least three different kinds of shell casings were found at the scene.\nOfficials said one of the occupants of the home returned fire, shooting at least six rounds at the suspects.\nThe girl was struck in the leg and was taken to Arnold Palmer hospital in stable condition.\nBesides the victim, there were four adults and one other child at the home during the shooting. No one else was hurt.\nA neighbor said she heard the gunfire in the home nearby\n\"What is this world coming to? A 9-year-old girl?\" said neighbor Debbie Kurchoff.\nSince June, officials said there have been 18 calls to the house alone, including an aggravated battery call in March.\n\"We have extra patrols now and in the foreseeable future,\" said Jane Watrel with the Orange County Sheriff's Office.\nThe Orange County sheriff is in the early planning stage of exploring a violence task force.\nCommunity activists like Jack Williams of Stop the Violence and Embrace think something needs to happen now.\nMore neighborhood watches, or cash incentives, might be used to report crime before it happens.\n\"I think incentives would work, just like it does with Crimeline. We can't stop all the crime. We can't stop all the violence, but we can make a dent in it,\" Williams said.\nAs detectives look for the people who put a young girl in the hospital and wreaked havoc on a neighborhood's peace of mind, Williams asks that the code of silence be forgotten.\n\"We've got to get past that, community I plead to you. Break that silence in the community. It's stupid, it's ignorant,\" Williams said.\nAnyone who was in the area at the time of the shooting should contact Crimeline at 1-800-423-TIPS (8477)."}
