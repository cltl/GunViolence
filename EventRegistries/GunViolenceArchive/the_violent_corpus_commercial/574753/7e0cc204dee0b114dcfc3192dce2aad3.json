Burke High School in the city's Dorchester neighborhood just after a fire alarm went off inside the school.\n\"We don't know whether it was just a fight that spilled out of the school. Unfortunately, as we know now, kids don't fight anymore with their hands. They run and get weapons,\" Police Commissioner William Evans said in an afternoon news conference.\nStudents said they heard six or seven shots. When the gunfire stopped, 17-year-old Raekwon Brown, a student, was dead and two other teens and a 67-year-old woman were wounded.\n\"When a 17-year-old dies on the street, coming out of school, then we all should be outraged, and shame on anybody who doesn't step up to the plate and help us solve this,\" Evans said.\nPolice and city officials called on the community to help them identify whoever was responsible.\n\"One homicide is too many homicides. A mother and parents are going to be notified today that their son has been killed. And I think that we have to do more and we need the entire community to do more,\" said Mayor Marty Walsh.\nAt a school committee meeting Wednesday night Superintendent Tommy Chang said trauma counselors would be at the school Thursday for students and staff.\n\"We send our condolences to the family and pray that one day we can see an end to senseless violence in this city and this country,\" Chang said.\nCopyright Associated Press"}
