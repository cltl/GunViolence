Burke High School on Washington Street, and some students said the gunfire occurred after a fire alarm went off inside the school.\nBoston police said a 17-year-old male was found dead at the scene.\nThree others, including two teenage boys and a 67-year-old woman were also injured, but their injuries are not described as life-threatening.\nWitnesses said they saw one of the victims running from the scene after shots were fired.\n\"When a 17-year-old dies on the street, coming out of school, then we all should be outraged, and shame on anybody who does not step up and help us out with this,\" Evans said. \"I'm calling on the community to step up and help us identify the individual who did this.\"\nThis is Boston's 13th homicide this year.\n\"The victim is too young to be gunned down in the middle of the street,\" Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said.\nThe victim has not been identified, but friends said he was a junior at the school and enjoyed making videos with his friends and posting them to YouTube.\n\"He's a nice kid. He gets good grades. Everyone he hangs out with gets good grades. So I'm not understanding,\" Victoria Johnson said. \"I don't know. I don't know what he was doing outside of school, but in school he was focused.\"\nEvans, at a news conference Wednesday afternoon, said the public should be outraged.\n\"When a young kid, he looks to be about 17, gets shot, we need the public to be outraged,\" he said. \"There are way too many guns on the streets. Way too many guns in the hands of young kids. We need everyone's help to get the guns off the street.\"\nBurke and nearby Dearborn STEM Academy and Lilla G. Frederick Pilot Middle School were placed into safe mode after the shooting, but that was lifted around 2:15 p.m.\nPolice are continuing to search for the shooter, and anyone with information about the incident should call police immediately."}
