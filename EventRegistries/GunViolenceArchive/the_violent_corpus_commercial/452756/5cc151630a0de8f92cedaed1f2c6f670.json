The child was transferred from there to Duke Hospital where he was listed in stable condition Wednesday afternoon.\n\"When we arrived on the scene, the child had already left,\" said Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison.\nOn Wednesday, deputies were working to determine how the child was shot, who was in the home at the time and who was responsible for the children there.\nHarrison said three other children, ranging in age from 7 months to 10 years old, and three adults were present at the time of the shooting."}
