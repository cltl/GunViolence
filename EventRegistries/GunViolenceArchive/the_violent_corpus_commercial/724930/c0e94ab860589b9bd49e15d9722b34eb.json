One of the deputies was transported by Acadian Ambulance to a nearby medical facility for further treatment due to a shrapnel fragment that was lodged below the knee. That deputy has since been released from medical care without requiring any surgery. The three other deputies who sustained minor injuries were also evaluated by medical personnel and have been cleared.\nThe names of the deputies involved are not being released at this time pending an internal investigation into this incident.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
