The extent of the girl\u2019s injuries is unknown.\n\u201cI heard gunshots and didn\u2019t really think much about it at first,\u201d one neighbor told KCCI. I grew up over here, so I\u2019ve heard it a lot, but having it happen right down the block was kind of interesting.\u201d\nAccording to the police report, video taken at the time of the shooting shows an occupant in a white-colored Mercury Sable fired six shots at the house.\nNo suspects have been arrested, and the case remains under investigation.\nCheck back with KCCI-TV, kcci.com or our mobile app for more on this"}
