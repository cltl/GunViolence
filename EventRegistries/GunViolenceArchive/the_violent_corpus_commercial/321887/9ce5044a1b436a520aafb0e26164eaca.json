Investigators said they believe Braylon was shot by a 3-year-old boy.\nShonda Robinson said her sister heard the gun go off, but was on the couch facing the other direction when the 3-year-old apparently found the weapon. A handgun was found near the 3-year-old. Neither of the other children sustained injuries. She said the family was unaware that any weapons were in the home and suspect it may have belonged to the child's father.\nShanee Robinson and Sims are scheduled to be arraigned on March 24 at 8:30 a.m. at the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas."}
