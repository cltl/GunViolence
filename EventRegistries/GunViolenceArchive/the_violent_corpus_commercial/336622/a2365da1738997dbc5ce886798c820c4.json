The guilty pleas are the result of the collaborative efforts of law enforcement and the community to reduce homicide and other violent crime under the Detroit One program. The announcement was made by U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade of the Eastern District of Michigan, Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, Special Agent in Charge Robin Shoemaker of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Detroit Field Division, Special Agent in Charge David P. Gelios of the FBI\u2019s Detroit Division and Chief James Craig of the Detroit Police Department. In 2015, Antonio Clark, Aramis Wilson, Tyrone Price, Jonathan Kinchen, Kojuan Lee, Kirshean Nelson, Dion Robinson and Kenneth Smith, were indicted on charges of RICO conspiracy and other racketeering and firearms charges relating to the May 7, 2015, gang-related shooting of four members of a family. The indictment charges that, from 2011 through 2015, the defendants trafficked in controlled substances, including marijuana, Xanax, and ecstasy, at locations around the Detroit metropolitan area, including in Detroit and at Northland Mall in Southfield, Michigan. According to the indictment, the Vice Lords is a national gang engaged in a variety of crimes, including murder, robbery, narcotics trafficking and witness intimidation. The indictment alleges that the Vice Lords\u2019 leaders are located in Chicago and Detroit, and that the gang is broken down into various \u201csets,\u201d \u201cdecks,\u201d or \u201cbranches,\u201d including the Detroit-based Traveling Vice Lords, Insane Vice Lords, Imperial Insane Vice Lords, Conservative Vice Lords, and Mafia Insane Vice Lords. The indictment further alleges that members who seek to leave or withdraw from the gang often endure a physical beating, known as a \u201cbeat out,\u201d by multiple Vice Lord members, or are targeted for killing, known as a \u201cgreen light.\u201d According to court documents, leading up to the May 7, 2015 shooting, members of the Vice Lords, acting at the direction of Kenneth Smith and others, searched for two brothers that had left, or had attempted to leave, the Vice Lords, as part of a plan to harm those individuals. On May 7, 2015, Vice Lords members Antonio Clark, Aramis Wilson, Tyrone Price, Jonathan Kinchen, Kojuan Lee, Kirshean Nelson, and Dion Robinson, traveled together to the intended victims\u2019 house in multiple cars. These Vice Lord members first met at Kenneth Smith\u2019s house to discuss their plans. They gathered firearms, including an AK-47 assault rifle, to assist in their plans. After a brief confrontation with family members, Clark opened fire with an AK-47 hitting four victims. The indictment charged these Vice Lords members with aiding and abetting one another in the shooting of the four family members after firing more than two dozen times at the family. All four victims suffered gunshot wounds, but are recovering.

Robin Shoemaker, Special Agent in Charge of the Detroit Field Division of ATF said, \u201cCountering firearms violence, particularly when it relates to violent street gangs remains one of ATF\u2019s primary missions, when it comes to gun violence ATF will continue to work hand in hand with our Detroit One partners to ensure that those individuals\u2019 who engage in violent criminal activity are removed from our neighborhoods. \"These convictions represent the significant impact law enforcement can have on violent criminal enterprises when local, state, and Federal partners combine forces to address the violent gangs responsible for terrorizing our communities,\" said David P. Gelios, Special Agent in Charge, FBI - Detroit Division. \"The quality of life in our community will remain closely aligned to our successful ongoing collective efforts to remove violent offenders from Detroit's streets.\" The charges relating to the May 7, 2015, shooting of the four family members are one component of the federal government\u2019s prosecution of the Vice Lords street gang, which has led to the arrests and convictions of Vice Lords leaders and members over several years. In two trials in March and May 2015, juries convicted eight leaders and members of the PhantomOutlaw Motorcycle Club, many of whom also were leaders and members of the Vice Lords, for various crimes, including a September \u2013 October 2013 mass murder plot against a rival organization of the Phantoms, and the September 2013 shooting ofa member of another rival organization.
