(Nov. 9th 2015) -- A game of dice turns deadly for two men in Indianapolis early Monday morning.\nTwo men were killed and two others remain in critical condition after someone tried to rob the victims. The coroner identified the two men killed as Thomas Stewart, 22, and Jonte Johnson, 24.\nOfficers responded to a call about multiple people shot in the 400 block of North Beville Ave. just before 3 a.m.\nPolice have not made any arrests, but they do have a possible motive.\nPolice found dice and money scattered throughout the home, leading investigators to believe someone shot the victims during a robbery.\n\u201cDetectives found evidence there was illegal gambling going on, but this was not a known illegal gambling establishment. It was some friends that had gathered to participate in a game and during the game we believe a robbery occurred,\u201d said IMPD Sgt. Kendale Adams.\nDetectives do not think any of the four victims shot each other, instead at least one suspect and maybe more, came into the home and committed the killings.\nPolice say illegal gambling is not uncommon in the city and there\u2019s not much law enforcement can do to stop the crime.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just bust into someone\u2019s house and see if they\u2019re illegally gambling or playing Uno. This would be no different.\u201d said Adams.\n\u201cI mean if someone\u2019s in their home and not bringing the attention of law enforcement, how would we know?\u201d\nWhile police don\u2019t have any suspects in this case, they did reiterate they do not think what happened inside the home was a random act and neighbors in the area should not be concerned for their safety.\nThe names of the other two victims have not been released by police.\nOfficers urge anyone with information about these shootings to call Crime Stoppers at 317-262-TIPS (8477)."}
