Another person is being questioned in the shooting, police said.\nPolice said the gunmen were retaliating against the boys' other brothers.\nOn Sept. 25, at around 3:50 a.m., a car pulled up outside a house on Narcissus near Flowers.\nThe occupants fired 14 shots into the home, killing Moises Jimenez as he slept in his bed. His 11-year-old brother, Manuel, was taken to Ben Taub General Hospital. He is still recovering from his injuries.\nThe two children attended nearby Southmayd Elementary School. Moises had recently started first-grade and his brother is a fifth-grader, family said.\nThe boys were in their beds when a dark sedan drove past the house and someone inside opened fire, said Sgt. Steven Murdock, an HPD homicide investigator. The gunshots crashed through a window and ripped through a wall. Several members of the boys' family were inside the home at the time of the shooting.\nMurdock has said the shooting may be gang- or drug-related. Officers have been called to the home several other times for incidents, though Murdock did not elaborate about those emergency calls for service. He also did not discuss evidence that led investigators to believe drugs or gangs may be connected to the shooting.\nPolice released surveillance images of a truck and sedan seen in the area at the time of the shooting."}
