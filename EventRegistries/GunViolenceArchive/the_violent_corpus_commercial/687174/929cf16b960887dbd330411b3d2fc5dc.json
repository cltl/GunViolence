The best way to describe it is identification of an intruder versus a friend playing a prank.\n\"He thought he heard someone enter his home and had his pistol in his bedroom for protection. As he was coming down the hallway, it appears Mr. Copeland jumped out to scare him and to pull a prank on him. The lights weren't on in the hallway and he didn't recognized his face. You're talking about a split-second decision when two people turn a corner, one has a gun and the other one is jumping out.\"\n\"It's a very tragic situation. It's very sad for both sides of the family and we here at the Sheriff's Office, our hearts go out to these folks,\" Captain Kight said.\nThe Sheriff's Office issued the following press release late Monday.\nAccording to Sheriff Alvie (Junior) Kight, the Toombs County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) Eastman Office are investigating a shooting that occurred at the residence of BRANDON PHILLIPS located at 998 Johnson Corner Road in Lyons, Toombs County. On 10/23/2016, at approximately 2:25 P.M., Toombs County 911 received a phone call from FALLON WILLIAMSON stating that CALEM COPELAND had been shot at PHILLIPS\u2019 residence.\nWhen deputies arrived on scene they discovered WILLIAMSON, COPELAND, and PHILLIPS at the residence. Inside of the residence, Deputies discovered WILLIAMSON providing medical treatment to COPELAND who suffered from a gunshot wound.
