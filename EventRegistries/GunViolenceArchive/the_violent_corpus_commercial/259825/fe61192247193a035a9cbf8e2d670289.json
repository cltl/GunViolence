Brian fretted one of their sons had caused a fire while cooking.\nIt was worse than that.\nRiley Spitler, then 16, thought a gun was empty when he jokingly pointed it at his 20-year-old brother and pulled the trigger, he later told police.\nThe bullet struck Patrick in the heart, killing him.\nRiley was later convicted of second-degree murder and, three months ago, was sentenced to up to 46 years in prison.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a tragedy,\u201d said Kevin Pearson, a friend of Pat\u2019s. \u201cThe family didn\u2019t just lose Pat. They lost Riley, too.\u201d\nThe parents\u2019 anguish didn\u2019t stop there.\nThe weapon that killed one son and sent the other to prison was bought by their mother, said Blackman-Leoni Township police.\nRiley had convinced his mom he needed the .380-caliber Taurus semiautomatic for self-defense.\nShe never told her husband, who didn\u2019t allow guns in the home, police said.\nSo today, in a quiet, emptier home on a dead-end street, a grieving man feels betrayed and a grieving woman bears guilt for their sadness.\n\u201cI could just strangle her. She didn\u2019t tell me anything,\u201d Brian told an officer about his wife, according to video from the officer\u2019s body camera.\nThe Spitlers, who declined comment, are preparing to appeal the verdict to the Michigan Court of Appeals. Their attorney, Al Brandt, also declined comment.\nDuring the sentencing, Brian Spitler lambasted prosecutors for pushing for such a long prison term.\nJackson County Assistant Prosecutor Steve Idema objected to the criticism, telling the judge Spitler wasn\u2019t speaking on behalf of Patrick, according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\u201cI am speaking on behalf of Patrick,\u201d Spitler spat at Idema. \u201cI\u2019m the only one in this room who represents Patrick.\u201d\nIdema declined comment for this story.\nThe story of how a single, horrific incident cost the Spitlers both of their children comes from interviews, trial transcripts, court files and police records. The records contained videotaped interviews of witnesses, including a 90-minute interrogation where Riley seemed to speak candidly about the incident and his life.\nThe two brothers couldn\u2019t be more different, Riley told police during the interview six days after the Dec. 6 shooting.\nRiley was a quiet, sullen loner, he and others told police. Despite being smart and articulate, he dropped out of school in the ninth grade.\nRiley told police he doesn\u2019t like being told what to do.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the most talkative or social person ever,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really take help from anybody. I don\u2019t really listen to anybody.\u201d\nRiley, who worked at McDonald\u2019s, said he sometimes sold drugs for a friend.\nPat, on the other hand, was a popular chatterbox with a goofy sense of humor, said his friends.\nHe also was a workhorse, putting in 18-hour days at Gordon Food Service and the Jackson YMCA.\nAt the YMCA, where he was a coach, bus driver and summer camp counselor, he was a favorite of the kids, chief executive Rick Wilson said.\nChildren were drawn to his constant smile and upbeat personality, Wilson said. He made them laugh by dressing up as Batman and Scooby-Doo.\n\u201cEach and every day was a joy when Pat was in our building,\u201d he said.\nPat tried to encourage his brother to do better, said friends. He felt Riley was smart and articulate but was wasting his life.\nPat had to tread carefully to avoid arguments with the volatile Riley, said friends.\nThree months before the 2014 shooting, the brothers fought after Pat criticized Riley, Riley told police.\nThey pushed each other, Riley struck Pat and Pat wrestled him to the ground.\n\u201cWe would just fight all the time,\u201d said Riley. \u201cWe straight up didn\u2019t like each other.\u201d\nBehavior unknown to dad\nOn Nov. 26, 10 days before the shooting, Riley and his mother visited a Dunham\u2019s Sports store in Jackson.\nShe paid $225 for the Taurus handgun in cash, according to the receipt, contained in the police file.\nRiley told police his mom was aware he was selling drugs. He said that was the reason he gave her for needing the gun.\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing Elaine Spitler knew about her wayward son.\nIn his bedroom was another semiautomatic handgun, two revolvers and a duffel bag holding four one-gallon Ziploc bags containing marijuana marked Chronic Thunder, Critical Rush, Liberty Haze and Blueberry.\nRiley told his mom he was holding the drugs and weapons for a longtime friend who had recently been charged with carrying a concealed weapon, he told police.\nAsked by police why his mom allowed such behavior, he said he often got his way by threatening to run away.\n\u201cI know what you think about my mom,\u201d Riley told police. \u201cYou know, horrible mother, horrible mother of the year.\u201d\nHe said his father didn\u2019t know any of this. Brian Spitler was never home, working two jobs as a bank security guard and at a phone parts warehouse.\nBrian Spitler told police he learned about the drugs and guns right after the shooting when his wife told him about them, according to video from an officer\u2019s body camera.\nGun worried older brother\nShortly after receiving the Taurus, Riley was walking into the house one day when he flashed it to his brother.\nPat, who was eating at the kitchen table, stopped chewing and asked whether it was real, Riley told police.\n\u201cHis eyes lit up,\u201d said Riley.\nPrivately, Pat was concerned, he confided in several friends.\nA week after seeing the gun, Pat was taking a weekly run with Dalton Dueck and asked if his friend could keep a secret, Dueck later told police.\nPat, who didn\u2019t know about the other weapons in his home, told Dueck about the gun, saying he was worried Riley might hurt someone. Dueck asked Pat if he was afraid Riley might hurt him.\n\u201cHe was, like, right off the bat, \u2018No, not at all.\u2019 He was real adamant,\u201d Dueck told investigators, according to police video of the interview.\nPat told Dueck he had talked to his mom about the gun but she didn\u2019t want to confront Riley. He apparently didn\u2019t know his mom had bought the weapon.\nPat said if he couldn\u2019t resolve the matter in a few days, he would tell his father about it, Dueck told police.\nTwo days later, Pat was dead.\n\u2018You shot me\u2019\nOn the night of Dec. 6, Pat was sitting on his bed, texting a friend, when Riley came into his room with the Taurus.\nWaiting for his brother to finish, Riley loaded and unloaded the gun, he told police.\nPat\u2019s trophies from high school and youth soccer were on the dresser, according to video from an officer\u2019s body camera. A blow-up Spiderman stood in the corner.\nRiley showed Pat how quickly he could rack the slide, and then handed the unloaded gun to his brother to see how fast he could do it, he told police.\nRiley reloaded the gun, racked the slide, which ejected a bullet, and pointed the weapon at his brother.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if it\u2019s your lucky day,\u201d he said.\nHe pulled the trigger.\n\u201cYou shot me,\u201d screamed Pat.\nRiley, who had had the weapon for just 10 days, later told police he thought he had released the magazine before ejecting the bullet.\nIn fact, the six-bullet magazine was still connected to the gun, feeding another round into the chamber when the first one was ejected.\nRiley called 911 while holding a rag to his brother\u2019s heart.\n\u201cBreathe, please breathe,\u201d said Riley, according to a recording of the call. \u201cI love you, Pat. I love you.\u201d\nRiley rushed outside to greet the police but his front glass door was locked or jammed so he used his fists to break through it, he said.\nBarefoot and shirtless in the December cold, he didn\u2019t realize his right hand was bleeding.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if I spend the rest of my life in jail,\u201d he told an officer. \u201cI just need to know that he\u2019s alive.\u201d\nPolice skeptical of account\nPolice and prosecutors didn\u2019t believe Riley\u2019s story.\nThey doubted that Pat, after expressing fears about the gun, would play with it.\nThey said a more likely scenario, given the brothers\u2019 turbulent relationship, was that Riley got angry for some reason and shot Pat.\n\u201cI think your brother was giving you some crap about the guns and you tried to intimidate him and the next thing that happened: you shot him,\u201d Detective Chris Boulter told Riley during the 2014 interview.\nBoulter declined comment.\nDuring a five-day trial in Jackson County Circuit Court, prosecutors made hay of Riley\u2019s troubled past, talking about how he sold drugs and hid guns for his friend.\nThe jury could have convicted Riley of involuntary manslaughter, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\nInstead, after deliberating two days, it found him guilty of second-degree murder, punishable by up to life.\nInvoluntary manslaughter involves careless behavior while second-degree murder involves an action that shows utter disregard for life.\nAnother name for the latter is depraved heart murder.\nRiley, who also was convicted of possession with intent to deliver marijuana and two counts of possessing a firearm during a felony, was given a prison sentence of 24-46 years.\nHe\u2019ll be eligible for parole in 20 years.\nOn the night of the shooting, sitting in an ambulance getting his hand treated, Riley repeatedly asked police and paramedics how his brother was doing, according to police videos.\nFearing how he would respond, they lied and said they didn\u2019t know.\n\u201cPlease tell me he\u2019s still alive,\u201d said Riley. \u201cIf not, just shoot me dead \u2019cause I can\u2019t do this. This is my brother\u2019s blood on my hands.\u201d\nfdonnelly@detroitnews.com\n(313) 223-4186"}
