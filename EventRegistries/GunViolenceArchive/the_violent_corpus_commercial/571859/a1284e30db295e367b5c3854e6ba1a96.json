When they arrived, they found a man outside with a gunshot wound to the arm, and then discovered two dead people inside the home.\nThe man with the gunshot wound to the arm was transported to the hospital and remains in serious condition, said Denver police spokesman Tyrone Campbell.\nA fourth victim was transported to the hospital by a private party, said Sonny Jackson, a Denver police spokesman. That person later died.\nThe block of Hudson Street is lined by duplexes and multifamily homes with well-manicured lawns. People were walking their dogs Saturday morning and slowing to look at crime scene technicians still working in the area.\nThe victims have not been identified, but Jackson said he believed they are all adult men. Campbell said it is unclear if the men all lived in the home or not, and would not release details about what drug may have been involved.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe it to be gang-related at this time,\u201d Jackson said.\nPolice initially said they were looking for multiple suspects, according to information they released on Twitter. By Saturday afternoon, Campbell said police are looking for a 2015 or newer, maroon, Chevy Tahoe with temporary tags that may be traveling out of state.\n\u201cWe are looking for a person or persons of interest,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cAnyone tied to that vehicle.\u201d\nCampbell said police are still looking for more witnesses or anyone who may have information about the shooting, and encouraged anyone with information to call 911.\nSaturday morning, neighbors said the block is usually quiet, despite being a few blocks away from Holly Square.\n\u201cIn all situations we\u2019re always asking our community to be vigilant,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cBut this appears to be an arranged encounter.\u201d\nSponsored Links\n.\nMoney MorningCapital Gains Tax Loophole?Money Morning\nWar Bitz20 Images of Damaged B-17 Bombers That Miraculously Made It HomeWar Bitz\nDealStealsTop rated mattress deals.
