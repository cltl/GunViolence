The child then alerted his dad,\u201d Captain Paco Balderrama with the Oklahoma City Police Department said.\nTurns out, this wasn\u2019t just any home.\n\u201cApparently, it was the child`s grandmother, the father`s mom, and they happened to live right behind each other,\u201d Balderrama said.\nSo, the child\u2019s father entered the home with a gun. When the suspect refused to cooperate and lunged toward him, the man shot him in the shoulder.\n\u201cThe suspect ran out of the mobile home park and was actually found in a separate mobile home. He was treated at the hospital and released,\u201d Balderrama said.\nPolice believe it\u2019s unlikely that charges will be filled against the homeowner\u2019s son for shooting the suspect. However, that\u2019s ultimately up to the district attorney.\n\"If his life was in danger he certainly had a right at that point to defend himself with deadly force. It's a very facts driven, specific situation which is one of the reasons why the police investigate it,\u201d Doug Freisen, an expert on use of force, said.\nThe homeowner\u2019s son told KFOR that the suspect actually lives in the mobile home park. He was arrested on burglary charges.\nWe are not identifying the suspect since he is a minor."}
