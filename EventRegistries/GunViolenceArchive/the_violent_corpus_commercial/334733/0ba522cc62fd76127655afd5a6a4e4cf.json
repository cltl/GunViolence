A misdemeanor charge of discharging a firearm resulting in injury or death was also included.\nHe received the mandatory sentence of two years for the felony charge of possessing a firearm, which will precede the other three sentences \u2014 which will run concurrently. He will serve 15 months for the other three counts, with an earliest release date of 3 1/2 years and a maximum of 10 years.\nThe sentence comes on the heels of a guilty plea by Howard in February. The plea deal with Druzinski was a means of capping Howard\u2019s sentence.\nHoward\u2019s attorney, Ryan Zemke, had no further comment on the plea deal besides saying he was happy Druzinski accepted it.\n\u201cWhat happened was a terrible accident and he takes responsibility for his actions,\u201d Zemke said.\nThe original incident occurred May 4, when Howard was 24. The Clinton Township resident was at Normandy Park, on Little Mack Avenue near 15 Mile Road, with his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s son \u2014 who is now 4 years old.\nHoward and the boy were in the park at dusk when a park ranger told them the park was closing. The ranger walked away to take care of his own business. Sirens were then heard and authorities found that the boy was injured by a gunshot wound to the head \u2014 an incident Howard deemed accidental.\nThe boy recovered in the hospital and is now OK. Zemke said the boy considers Howard to be his father, as he\u2019s \u201cthe only father figure in his life.\u201d The boy was the female\u2019s son from a previous relationship, though at the time she was pregnant with Howard\u2019s child. That baby is now about a couple of months old.\n\u201c(The fianc\u00e9e) spoke at sentencing and asked (Druzinski) for leniency, and she spoke about the positive impact of Howard (on her and her son),\u201d Zemke said."}
