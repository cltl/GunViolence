Shots were fired in both directions between several people.\nColumbus Police say the investigation is ongoing as they work to determine what roles the known and unknown individuals had in the incident.\nThe glass doors to the restaurant were riddled with bullet holes. One Wendy\u2019s employee told NBC4 she was thankful she hadn\u2019t been working that night.\n\u201cIn this kind of neighborhood, you never know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d Lanel Haywood said.\nHaywood, who lives nearby, said she got a call from a coworker and came to the restaurant to find out what happened.\n\u201cIt was spooky,\u201d she said. \u201cI never expected something like this to happen where I work at.\u201d\nThe restaurant and its parking lot were surrounded by police tape as detectives cased the scene.\nKelly Sturms was on her way to pick up her niece, who works at the restaurant, when she saw all of the flashing lights of the police cruisers. She called her sister to find out was going on.\n\u201cIt just freaked me out,\u201d Sturms said. \u201cThen when I heard that there was [a] shooting, the first thing that came out my mouth: \u2018Is she OK?'\u201d\nAs detectives continue to investigate what led up to this, Lanel Haywood is just grateful all her coworkers are safe and glad that she wasn\u2019t there.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have been able to handle this kind of situation,\u201d Haywood said.\nEarlier Tuesday evening, police said there were three suspects, last seen running down an alley. Police said security cameras could play a major role in tracking down anyone who fled the scene.\nPolice don't know yet what fight was about. Restaurant was hit by shots fired from outside.
