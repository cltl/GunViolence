Cuomo, the Daily News has learned.\nLarry Pagett, a longtime leader of the Eight Trey Crips, allegedly gunned down Chrispine Philip, a reputed member of the Folk Nation gang, inside the Buda Hookah Bar on Aug. 28, finishing him off with a bullet fired into his brain, according to court papers filed in Brooklyn Federal Court.\nPagett, 35, then allegedly shot his way out of the Flatbush Ave. lounge bar, hitting numerous people in his path.\n\u201c(Pagett) brazenly opened fire in a crowded bar, killing his intended target and wounding five others,\u201d stated Assistant Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Geddes.\n\u201cIn doing so, Pagett displayed a complete and utter disregard for human life and the consequences of his actions.\u201d\nDetectives are investigating whether Philip\u2019s murder fueled a wild gun battle between Folk Nation and Eight Trey Crips gang members outside the Ebbets Field Apartments on Sept. 7, sources told The News.\nAuthorities recovered chilling video from the hookah bar of Pagett standing over Philip, 27, and firing a bullet into his head at close range, court papers state.\nCarey Gabay, a Harvard-educated first deputy counsel to the Empire State Development Corp., was attending a J\u2019Ouvert celebration nearby and was cut down by a stray bullet. Gabay was taken off life support last Wednesday.\nInvestigators believe the hookah bar slaying was related to a feud between the street gangs that has been brewing for months and was partly in retaliation for a previous murder of an Eight Trey Crip by a Folk Nation gunman.\nPagett was charged with violating his supervised release from a 2008 federal conviction by killing Philip.\nA spokesman for Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said the gang murders remain under investigation.\nAuthorities recovered chilling video from the hookah bar of Pagett standing over Philip, 27, and firing a bullet into his head at close range, court papers state.\nPagett\u2019s lawyer did not return a call seeking comment. His Crips crew has wreaked havoc around the Vanderveer and Flatbush Estates housing developments for years.\nPagett\u2019s rap sheet includes wounding a bystander while fleeing a robbery, and shooting a man with a rifle from a sixth-story window perch in 2005.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a sniper,\u201d Pagett told Brooklyn Federal Judge Edward Korman at his sentencing in the 2005 case.\n\u201cThe government is trying to make me out to be a vicious gangbanger \u2026 they\u2019re trying to convince the court that I am a maniac that has no value for other people\u2019s lives.\n\u201cPersonally, if I came across someone as ignorant and psychotic as the government is (making) me out today, I myself would fear them being loose amongst society,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of his rant."}
