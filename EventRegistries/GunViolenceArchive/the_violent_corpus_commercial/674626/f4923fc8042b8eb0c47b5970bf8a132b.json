One witness told police the man had already received a haircut, made a phone call and then returned just before the two males entered the barbershop. The man also ran out the front door with the two males during the shooting.\nDetectives are waiting to interview the man to determine if he was involved in the robbery, Cleveland police spokeswoman Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said.\nA second witness told police he saw a black male in all red run from the barbershop, sit down at the corner and make a phone call. The witness said he heard the person on the other end of the phone ask the man \"You just got shot in the chest?\" That is all the witness heard, the incident report said.\nPolice were later called to Metro Hospital after a man was dropped off at the entrance with a gun shot wound to the chest. Witnesses to the shooting identified the man as one of the shooters who attempted the robbery at the barbershop. The man was later arrested at the hospital by police.\nSgt. Ciaccia said the man arrested at the hospital was a 16-year-old who had a gunshot wound to the chest. The two men named in the report who were involved in the robbery were still on the loose, she said.\nCopyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
