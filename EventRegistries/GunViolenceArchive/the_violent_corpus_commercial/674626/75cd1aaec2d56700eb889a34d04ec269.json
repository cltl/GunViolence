The civilian suffered non-life threatening injuries.\nAfter abandoning the Avenger in a neighborhood, Miller fled on foot.\nIt was in a neighborhood off of Hill Avenue in South Toledo where police finally chased down Miller on foot.\nPolice were able to apprehend him without exchanging any gun fire.\nToledo Police say Miller had active warrants in Michigan and Ohio.\nChief Kral had nothing but good things to say for Toledo Police, the Lucas County Sheriff\u2019s Office and the Ohio State Highway Patrol for working together and successfully bringing the suspect behind bars.\n\"I want to give a special shout out to the dispatcher\u2019s office. They were juggling four active crimes scenes at the same time trying to coordinate information to let us know what was going on to keep us safe.\"\nMiller is being held at the Lucas County Jail on a $1 million bond."}
