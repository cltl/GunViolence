(CBS4) \u2013 Emotions ran high at a vigil in Thornton Saturday night as friends remembered 16-year-old Haley Vargaz, the teen they say was shot and killed at a party Saturday morning.\n\u201cI talked to her every day and now it\u2019s like I have that part of me missing,\u201d said Vargaz\u2019s best friend, who did not want to be identified.\nTeens told CBS4 the party was cut short just before 2 a.m.\nTwo sisters, who did not want to be identified, tried to keep Vargaz alive until police got to the scene.\n\u201cSome guy just started shooting in the house and everybody started running to their cars, and I saw a girl just fall in the middle of the street,\u201d said one teen. \u201cNobody was helping her, so we just couldn\u2019t leave her there by herself.\u201d\nAnother teen stepped in and tried to save her.\n\u201cI grabbed my friend\u2019s shirt and I just wrapped it around my hand and just put it over the wound to stop the bleeding,\u201d said another teen who did not want to be identified.\nThe shooter is described as a thin Hispanic male, in his late teens or early 20s, with brown hair, glasses, and a gold hoop nose ring.\nNow, Vargaz\u2019s friends want to make sure she isn\u2019t remembered by how she died, but how she lived.\n\u201cPeople know her as the girl who got shot right now, but I don\u2019t want her to be known as that, I know she wouldn\u2019t want to be known as that,\u201d said Vargas\u2019 best friend. \u201cI just want people to remember her as Haley Vargas, the one who was always smiling and made people smile.\u201d\nAndrea Flores is a reporter for CBS4.
