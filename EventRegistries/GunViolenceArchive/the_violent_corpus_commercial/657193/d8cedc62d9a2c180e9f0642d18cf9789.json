They were really loud. You could hear people screaming. People were running to their cars and driving away,\u201d said Neddie Sandoval, 77, a neighbor.\nThere were two bursts of gunshots, with five or six shots fired each time, Sandoval said. She was first awakened by nearby voices in the normally quiet neighborhood a half block away from West Ridge Elementary School. It sounded like an argument, she said.\nMinutes later, police cars with lights flashing filled the block, Sandoval said. Police were talking to several witnesses, she said. It appeared that a lot of people had attended a party, she said. Police wrapped yellow crime-scene tape around several houses, including hers.\nWhen police arrived in the area of Monaco Way and Krameria Street, they found a juvenile girl lying in the street with a gunshot wound to the torso. She was taken to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead.\nWitnesses told detectives that some type of disturbance broke out during a house party.\nOne girl said on social media that she watched her best friend die.\n\u201cI saw it all. Watched u take your last breath. Saw u at your best and never any less than that. You fought but God decided he needed you back,\u201d Julie Torres posted on Facebook.\nThe suspect fired his gun just as he was leaving the home, Barnes\u2019 news release says.\nThe victim\u2019s friends mourned her on social media.\n\u201cMy best friend was more than just a 16-year-old girl who was at a party.. She was an amazing person,\u201d Alyssa Montoya wrote. \u201cShe deserves justice and I\u2019m gonna get that for you I promise you. \u2026 I love you so much.\u201d\nTorres also wrote about her loss.\n\u201cShe was my world. The realist one out there. Knew me better than anyone else I\u2019d do anything to have her by my side again,\u201d Torres wrote.\nOn Saturday afternoon, Barnes said detectives were still trying to track down people who had been at the party and perhaps seen the shooting.\n\u201cThey\u2019re still following up on tips and trying to identify additional witnesses,\u201d he said.\nBarnes said there is \u201cno indication\u201d at this time that the shooting was gang-related. He said the victim lived in unincorporated Adams County.\nThe dark-haired suspect was described as being \u201cskinny\u201d and about 5-feet-6. He wore eyeglasses and a gold hoop ring in one nostril. He was wearing a gray sweatshirt.\nWitnesses said he may have arrived in a red sedan.\nThe residential, normally uneventful neighborhood is a mix of retired couples and young families, Sandoval said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice and quiet here,\u201d she said.\nSponsored Links\n.\nHome Solar QuotesHomeowners Are Furious With Their Power Company!Home Solar Quotes\nVital Reds SupplementHow To Fix Your Fatigue (Do This Every Day)Vital Reds Supplement\nWonderBuzzThis Dog's Life Changed Forever When These Hikers Stumbled Upon Him.
