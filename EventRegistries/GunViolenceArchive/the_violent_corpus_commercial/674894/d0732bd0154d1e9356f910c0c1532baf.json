Terrible,\" Wright said.\nThe sheriff said a second suspect, later identified as a 13-year-old, fled from the scene and was shot at as well but they do not believe that person was hit and had not received any reports on gunshot victims at area hospitals.\nAccording to the sheriff, a car had been stolen from the same residence earlier today or yesterday and it seems as if the same people came back to get another car, though he is not certain.\nThe sheriff said a handgun was also found laying next to the body of the suspect.
