Apparently, one of the shots came in through the wall ended up striking the little girl in the body.\"\nWDIV-TV, Channel 4 News reports she was struck in the buttocks.\nKirkwood said a motive hasn't been released and no suspects have been arrested but the shooting remains under investigation.\nThe shooting took place on the 6000 block of Crane in east Detroit.\nTwo children, 3-year-old Aiyana Montgomery and 6-month-old Miracle Murray, died earlier this year after being struck by bullets in two separate shootings.\nPolice previously said there was a \"gang nexus\" to each of those shootings and the killing of Miracle Murray, who was shot in the back while in a stroller outside her father's Detroit home, might have been retaliation for the killing of Aiyana.\nFour people -- one who committed suicide in jail -- were arrested in the shooting of Aiyana.\nDetroit police initially arrested two men in connection with the Miracle case but later released them without charges and said they are still investigating."}
