Three of those victims died, police confirmed.\n\"The Cincinnati Police Department is doing everything possible to investigate and address these violent acts,\" Lt. Steve Saunders said Saturday. \"But we need the cooperation of the community to identify whoever is involved. We need people to come forward and call Crime Stoppers. It's difficult for us to investigate these serious incidents without information.\"\nAs of July 16, police reported that the total number of shooting victims in 2016 was down 13 percent from last year and homicides were down 17 percent, according to the Strategic and Tactical Analytic Review for Solutions report published by CPD.\n\"I would look at what has occurred this weekend as a momentary uptick in shootings. I think a great deal of it is attributable to the heat,\u201d City Manager Harry Black said \u201cIt\u2019s not scientific. It\u2019s not quantifiable, but I believe there\u2019s a direct correlation between the weather and crime.\u201d\nBlack explained that increased social activity and more people outdoors could lead to more conflicts. He has been in conversations with police officials through the weekend.\n\u201cThe victims, as of right now, as well as the perpetrators don\u2019t appear to have been on any of our watch lists,\" Black said. \"A couple of the victims may have had some minimal previous contact with law enforcement, but nothing that would rise to a level of concern.\u201d\nSince last summer, when shooting numbers were high for months, the city has begun several initiatives to combat the problem.\n\u201cWe have beefed up our CIRV activities. We have beefed up the resources that are in our Human Relations Commission. We\u2019ve expanded staffing resources. We have reactivated the Partnering Center. Our outreach workers are out and engaged and active in terms of engaging community groups as well as families,\u201d Black said.\nThe Cincinnati Police Department also began the P.I.V.O.T. program, which allows investigators go beyond neighborhoods when identifying high crime areas prone to gun violence. The new data collection and analysis allows block-by-block analysis and even allows officers to examine specific areas with apartment buildings.\nDespite these efforts, Black said the violence this weekend may fall outside of ongoing gang and drug trafficking activity, which can be tracked and investigated.\n\u201cA lot of this is boiling down to personal conflict,\u201d Black said. \u201cHow do you anticipate personal beefs and personal conflict? I don\u2019t think you can do that.\u201d\nBlack explained that while the violence this weekend is tragic, he doesn't believe it will continue.\n\"Safer streets is one of our top priorities and we are investing in it,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe key is\u2026we are trying to spend more money, but we\u2019re trying to spend it in a very strategic and smart way.\u201d\nPastor Ennis Tait has responded to every homicide in Cincinnati this year through Project Nehemiah Ceasefire and Cincinnati Works with vigils, anti-violence marches, youth mentorship and other programs. Tait was on the scene of Saturday's shooting in Avondale.\n\"This rash of shootings in the past 24 hours has been more than we've seen in a long time,\" Tait said. \"One of the things that I know that's missing in our city right now is hope.\"\nHe explained that he believes preventing violence in the streets starts with families.\n\"If you see an increase in broken relationships at home, you're going to see broken relationships in other places,\" Tait said. \"The spirit of brokenness eats away at a person's conscience and when that happens their respect for life begins to dissipate.\"\nTait said he plans to continue with vigils and take other action in response to Saturday's homicides.\n\"There have to be people inside our families who are willing to use their influence,\" he said.\nShootings presented in chronological order:\nNorth Fairmount: 2 injured\nAt least two men were shot late Friday night in the area of Beekman and Cummins streets.
