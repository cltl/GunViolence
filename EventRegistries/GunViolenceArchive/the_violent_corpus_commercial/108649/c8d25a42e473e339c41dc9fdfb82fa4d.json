The other remained in critical condition.\nAfter running out of bullets, authorities said, Rhoades grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed a woman. One person escaped the building, covered in blood, and ran to the Alturas police station to alert the authorities, according to KRCR.\nRhoades was taken into custody after the attack in the small Northern California community of Alturas, police Chief Ken Barnes said.\nWhen officers arrived after the attack, Barnes said, Rhoades was outside the building, running and clutching a knife. A Rancheria employee helped tackle her and she was quickly subdued and brought into custody.\nA person who answered the phone at a residence listed for declined to comment.\nThe headquarters \u2014 a ranch-style building with a pitched brown metal roof \u2014 is in a residential area about a block from the police station. The area was cordoned off with yellow police tape, and a light powered by a generator was illuminating the building.\nInvestigators said they found two guns but Barnes said he didn't know whether both had been used in the shooting, according to the paper.\nAlturas, the seat of Modoc County, is about 55 miles south of the Oregon border and 35 miles west of the Nevada line.

The Rancheria owns 26 acres in Cedarville, where many of its families reside.\n\"You wouldn't think this would happen in a small town like this,\" said Mike Tedrick, a retired county auditor who lives about 50 yards from the tribal headquarters. \"If it happened here, it could happen anywhere.\"\nTedrick said he and his wife were watching television and did not hear any shots. They did, however, hear police sirens.\n\"Police were all over the place,\" he said."}
