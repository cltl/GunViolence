So this three-year-old for sure, needs our thoughts and prayers,\" says Precinct Four Constable Mark Herman.\nPrecinct Four Constables responded to the scene, and when they saw how bad it was they called in the Harris County Sheriff's Office. LifeFlight took the little boy to Memorial Hermann. We're told he in critical condition.\n\"They were moving him up to Pediatric ICU. It may be a day or two before we know exactly what the status is,\" says Sgt. Ben Beall.\nNeighbors tell us the grandparents babysit him all the time. We're told they put him down for a nap around 3:30pm, and around 4pm, he shot himself in the face.\nHarris County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Ben Beall tells us the gun was in the bedroom. Beall also says the boy's grandfather couldn't say for sure whether the gun was on or in the nightstand.\n\"We're going to complete the investigation. We're going to make sure we have our crime scene lab work back. And once the investigation is completed, we'll contact the District Attorney's Office,\" he said.\nIf charges are filed here, Sgt. Beall says it'll likely be making a firearm accessible to a juvenile. That's a misdemeanor that comes with up to a year in county jail."}
