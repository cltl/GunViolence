(WKYT) - Lexington police say a 14-year-old was seriously injured in an accidental shooting Tuesday night.\nThe shooting happened around 7:30 p.m. at the Raintree Apartments on North Locust Hill Drive.\nPolice say the 14-year-old and two other teenagers were playing with a gun in one of the apartments, when the gun accidentally fired, hitting the victim in the neck. The parents of the teenager who shot the gun were not home when the shooting happened.\nPolice tell WKYT that after the shooting happened, the teen responsible left the scene. Originally, police were investigating the case as a drive-by shooting because of information they were given.\nHowever, it wasn't long until the teenager responsible told police the truth.\n\"His parents showed up and spoke to him. After they spoke to him, he realized that he needed to be telling the truth. So the parents came up to us and advised us that he was willing to give us a different story at that time,\" Lt. Jackie Newman said.\nPolice say the teenager was taken to UK Hospital, where as of 8:30 p.m., he was in surgery. Police say his condition is stable.\nLexington police are still investigating the shooting, but at this point, they say no charges have been filed.\n\"We're more concerned about the condition of the 14-year-old and we believe at this time, that the reason the story was given is because they were trying to protect their friend who was involved in the incident- didn't want him to get in any trouble,\" Lt. Newman said."}
