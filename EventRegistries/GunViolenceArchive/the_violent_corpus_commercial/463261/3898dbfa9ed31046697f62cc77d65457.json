All he was saying is my chest hurt,\" Leticia (last name withheld) said. \"He kept trying to look up and I kept bringing his attention back down.\"\n\"It's just so sad these kids are left to run around all the time. That's what it is. Unsupervised kids it's not so much guns. It's just that parents aren't watching their kids,\" Melissa Pulido, neighbor, said. \"They're not taking their responsibility.\"\nThe friend who accidentally shot the teen boy has been arrested and is now in the Harris County Juvenile Detention Center on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\nInvestigators were scene removing several firearms from the apartment where this happened, including what looked like a semi-automatic rifle.\nPolice say the 22-year-old who rents the apartment where this happened has also been arrested on a charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.\nThe teen who was shot is listed in serious condition."}
