An autopsy is expected to be conducted Friday.\nInvestigators are working with a vague description of the suspect being a white man wearing basketball shorts and long socks. Hagen said it is believed the shooter is no longer in the Helena area.\nThe shooting happened around 11 a.m. The victim died a short time later, after medical efforts failed.\nAuthorities say they don't believe there is an immediate threat to the public as a result of the shooting, although the suspect should be considered armed and dangerous.\nPolice questioned potential witnesses at the scene, which remained blocked off throughout the day. Hagen said investigators were questioning \"people of interest,\" but no one had been detained as of Thursday evening.\nOfficials declined to say what kind of weapon was used or whether the firearm was recovered."}
