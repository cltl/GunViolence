Not knowing it was real or loaded, Jacob put the gun to his brother's head and pulled the trigger.\n\u201cWhat we were told is that he shot him straight here,\u201d said Marisa Melendez, Ezequiel\u2019s aunt. \u201cJacob is taking it very hard he feels sad and he feels bad for what he did but everybody's telling him, \u2018it's not your fault Jacob.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt shocked me because I was like, there's no way, this little angel could be gone. He was just here last week with me,\u201d Melendez said.\nAt Grapevine Elementary, classmates of Ezekiel are still having a tough time coping with their loss. Since Monday, grief counselors have been on campus providing students with support.\n\u201cThey told us that he had a really bad accident,\u201d said Yolanda Sarmiento, one of Ezequiel\u2019s classmates.\nThe Riverside County Sheriff's Department says no one has been arrested and it will be up to the district attorney to decide whether to press charges.\n\u201cIf you have a gun, lock it up,\u201d Melendez said. \u201cDon't leave it out in the open for a child to grab, make sure it's locked up securely and that the child does not know where it's locked up.\u201d\nA GoFundMe account has been set up to help pay for funeral expenses and counseling for Ezekiel's family. So far nearly $8,000 has been raised.\nEzequiel's parents will hold a memorial for him on Saturday in Temecula. On Wednesday he will be laid to rest, 15 feet from his grandfather.\nCopyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
