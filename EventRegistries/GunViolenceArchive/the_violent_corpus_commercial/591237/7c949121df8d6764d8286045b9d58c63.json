Upon arrival, they found three people with gunshot wounds.\nThe 46-year-old man was found in the garage and a 47-year-old woman and 11-year-old girl were found in the front yard.\nThe woman died at the scene. The man and the girl were rushed to an area hospital where they later died.\nThe woman's two other kids, ages 13 and 21, who were inside the home at the time of the shooting were not hurt. When police arrived, they found them hiding behind a boat outside the home.\nThe husband has been identified as Corpus Christi firefighter Steven Dolan and the wife is Brenda Dolan. The 11-year-old has been identified as Madelyn Rychetski.\nPolice said they believe the couple was arguing before the shooting happened. They believe the incident may have started in the home because there was blood found inside the home.\n\"We are a very small community,\" said Sylvia Carrillo, the city manager of Aransas Pass. \"That girl did attend our schools.\"\n\"We are very tight knit community, and these things do impact us,\" said Assistant Chief of Police David Perkins.\nPrior to Tuesday's incident, police were called to the home two other times, but at the time they were not believed to be domestic issues. However, police said they will look into whether domestic violence was an issue in the home.\nThe 13-year-old and 21-year-old are now with family members.\nSteven Dolan had been a firefighter with the Corpus Christi Fire Department for 19 years and worked at Fire Station No. 1.\nCCFD Chief Robert Rocha told KRIS 6 News Reporter Anayeli Ruiz Dolan never had any issues and had a \"solid\" career with the department. He said the department is saddened by the news and send prayers to the families of those involved.\nAuthorities confirmed that Steven Dolan with CCFD killed Brenda Dolan yesterday in AP. Steven also shot step daughter & killed himself\n\u2014 Anayeli Ruiz (@AnayeliNews) June 29, 2016\nPress conference is about to start in Aransas Pass.
