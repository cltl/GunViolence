(WANE) Fort Wayne Police responded to a shooting on the city\u2019s south side late Wednesday afternoon.\nPolice were called just before 4:30 p.m. to the intersection of Avondale Drive and Baxter Street, on a report of shots fired after a neighbor called 911 and ran out to find an apparent shooting victim. Responding officers moved to an alleyway between Avondale and Lafayette Street where they found a 15-year-old boy suffering from a gunshot wound.\nThe teen was taken away in critical condition. Police spokesman Jeremy Webb said initially detectives thought they might have to fingerprint the boy in an attempt to identify him. As of Thursday morning he remained in critical condition.\nWebb said police do not have a suspect. He said detectives have possible witnesses, but they\u2019re working to determine what those people actually know. A K-9 was used to track the shooter but the search was terminated.\nBack at the scene, police taped off the alleyway and detectives could be seen processing evidence. A pile of bloody clothes was laying on the ground. Children ran around outside the crime scene tape while a crowd gathered."}
