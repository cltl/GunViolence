She will live in our hearts forever and will be truly missed.\u201d\nThere was confusion after the initial shooting over whether Shirley was dead or had just gotten separated from her family. Loved ones took to social media to beg for information.\nA family spokesman told an Ohio radio station that \u201cSteve and Shirley raised an amazing family, three amazing girls. Their family was everything to them.\u201d\nHe said the couple were on their way to a family cruise leaving from Fort Lauderdale.\nSteve and Shirley, who owned the now-shuttered The Mayfair stores in Cambridge, Ohio, were married in 1966, according to an anniversary announcement in The Daily Jeffersonian.

The couple had been married for nearly 40 years.\nKim said her father had worked at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for about 20 years, most recently as a radiological control technician. He was also a volunteer with the Oceana Volunteer Fire Department in Virginia Beach.\n\u201cI know that everyone always says that people are the greatest in the world, but he was the greatest person you could know,\u201d Kim said. \u201cHe never had a horrible word to say about anyone or anything.\u201d\nDarrin Stevens, a friend of Andres, said he was \u201ca hell of a great guy.\u201d\n\u201cHe was one of the most helpful men you would have ever wanted to meet,\u201d Stevens said in a Facebook message. \u201cAny time he could help someone out he did anything he could.\u201d\nA former fire department volunteer, Tommy Harrell, told the Miami Herald that he remembered Terry \u201cas being a great person and doing anything to help out.\u201d\nOlga Woltering, 84\nOlga Woltering/Facebook\nWoltering and her husband, Ralph, are from Marietta, Georgia.

Her habit of calling everyone \u201clove\u201d or \u201clovey\u201d was made all the more charming by her British accent.\n\u201cOlga was one of the most joyful, loving, caring and committed people I have ever met,\u201d the church\u2019s pastor, Fr. Fernando Molina-Restrepo, said in a statement. \u201cThis is a horrible tragedy for everyone here at Transfiguration, especially because Olga was so loved.\u201d\nOther parishioners mourned Olga\u2019s death on social media.\n\u201cTragedy hit too close to home today. Transfiguration Church lost a very loving and caring woman in the Ft Lauderdale airport attack,\u201d Jerry de Varennes wrote on Facebook, along with a photo of the couple on a couch, smiling and bouncing babies on their laps.\nThe family put out a statement Saturday asking for privacy in their time of grief and calling Olga \u201cthe cornerstone of our family.\u201d\n\u201cWhile she\u2019s absent in our lives now, she remains in our hearts, thoughts, and memories for ever,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHer bright smile and loving manner will be missed by all who had the fortune to know her. She rarely seemed to meet a stranger, rather she had a smile or a hug for all. She was a blessing in the lives of family and friends.\u201d\nThe couple lived in a retirement community and were socially active, Alvin Connolly, a member of their church, told The Associated Press.\n\u201cShe and her husband were kind of the life of the party,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d go to a dance, and they\u2019d be the last ones on the floor.\u201d\n\u201cYou look at them and say, \u2018Man, I hope I can do everything they do when I\u2019m that age,\u2019 \u201d Connolly said.\nMichael Oehme, 57\nMichael Oehme/Facebook\nMichael Oehme and his wife, Kari, flew to Fort Lauderdale from Omaha, Nebraska, for their annual cruise. When the shooting started, he was killed and his wife was injured, according to Omaha TV station WOWT.\nThe witness who told TV stations about the couple, Mark Lea, told Omaha ABC affiliate KETV that he ran to help Kari Oehme moments after the shooting.\n\u201cI saw that she had a through-and-through on the right shoulder \u2026 And she said \u2018where\u2019s my husband, where\u2019s my husband?\u2019 And I asked her to describe him, and she described him and I looked right over there and saw a white-haired guy in a blue shirt that he had on \u2026 and he was not moving, not breathing.\u201d\nMichael Oehme owned a surveying business, according to the Omaha World-Herald. They lived in Council Bluffs, Iowa, which is across the Missouri River from Omaha.\nHis sister told The Associated Press that the couple was headed to the Caribbean.\n\u201cThey were supposed to leave today,\u201d Elizabeth Oehme-Miller, 52, said on Saturday. \u201cThey were happy to be going on another trip.\u201d\nA family member is flying down to help Kari, who was a clerical worker at a Council Bluffs office, return home.\nOehme-Miller heard about the news through a text message from her daughter.\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it\u2019s true,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t hit yet. I\u2019m kind of in shock right now.\u201d\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}
