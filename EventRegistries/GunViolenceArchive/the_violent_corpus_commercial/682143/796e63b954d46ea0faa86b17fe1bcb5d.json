It was a friend, that Caron\u2019s family says killed the 63-year-old father of four Friday evening.\n\u201cThey were just good friends. They were good buddies. They hung out all the time, I think. They were together a lot,\u201d said his 20-year-old daughter Nicole Caron.\nCaron said her father knew 35-year-old suspect Chad Couture through the tool manufacturing industry they both worked in. Now, Couture is behind bars on charges of first degree manslaughter and criminal possession of a firearm for allegedly shooting Caron in the chest, in the driveway of his parents\u2019 home.\n\u201cI\u2019ve met him on multiple occasions. He\u2019s been here before. He lived right down the street,\u201d Caron recalled.\nBristol Police wouldn\u2019t comment on the pair\u2019s relationship or a motive. Investigators said they recovered a handgun at the crime scene, 240 Woodland Street.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem real. You know, my dad, I don\u2019t know how this could happen to him,\u201d said Caron.\nShelly Krpata was married to Caron for 18 years. Despite their divorce two-years-ago she said he remained present her life.\n\u201cHe was also there to help out when he was needed. He would drop everything and help the kids,\u201d Krpata said.\nDescribed as an outgoing, social man who loved his family, Caron spent most of his life in Bristol before moving in with his sister in Harwinton, recently.\n\"My dad was just a very charismatic just kind friendly, just friendly man. He had a very good spirit,\u201d said Caron.\nAs she looked at pictures of her father when she was first born she\u2019s left wondering why her father was killed.\n\u201cI love him. I love him so much and I just want people to know he was a good person, he was,\u201d she added.\nCouture\u2019s bond was set at $500,000."}
