They're very, very quiet. They don't say anything bad, don't say anything at all,\" Peterson said.\nPolice say an argument broke out in the home early Sunday morning. The child's father and his mother's ex-boyfriend began fighting. Someone fired a gun, an unusual occurrence in the quiet neighborhood.\n\"It's usually just like this, like it is right now. People walking up and down the street, lots of kids playing,\" neighbor Zach Mann said.\nNeither Peterson nor anyone in the surrounding houses could recall hearing or seeing anything unusual.\n\"Didn't hear a thing. Didn't see a thing,\" Mann said.\nThis is yet another case of a child shot in Kansas City. People on the block can't believe it happened so close to home.\n\"It wasn't like this when I moved in. I'm really sick about it. My god, back in my day people might get in fights but there were no guns involved,\" said a neighbor who didn't want to be identified.\nFortunately, police say the bullet just grazed the child. He suffered only minor injuries. Police are looking for his father who they believe may have fired the shot.\n\"It's scary but it could happen in any neighborhood,\" Mann stated.\nNeighbors and family members say they're upset but also realize the outcome could have been much worse.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
