Moments later they heard sounds of yelling and a vehicle backing up and stopping.\nWhen they went outside to investigate, Lonergan said, he saw four teenage boys: two walking around, one sitting in the road and the fourth lying across him with his shirt up, his chest smeared in blood.\nLonergan, a pre-med student at the University of Maine, said he wanted to help the teen, but it was apparent from the wound that he only had moments to live.\n\u201cAs I got closer, I could tell that the bullet hole was right where the heart was,\u201d he said.\nThe other teens told Lonergan that the shooter, a white male whom they\u2019d met only once before, had taken off on foot toward nearby Island Pond Road, he said.\n\u201cThey were talking about a drug deal going wrong,\u201d specifically citing marijuana, Lonergan said.\nMichael Riley, another neighbor, said firecrackers are not infrequent in the rural area, so he thought nothing of the initial sounds he heard Monday night. But when he went outside to check, he found the group of teenagers, who seemed unfamiliar with the area, he said.\nThe vehicle\u2019s driver said, \u2018Hey, my buddy got shot,\u2019 and \u2018Where am I?\u2019\u201d Riley recalled.\nRiley said the gunman had apparently taken off through the woods.\nThursday around noon, some of Kinney\u2019s friends laid flowers at the site and spray-painted messages on the street in bright blue: \u201cColes World,\u201d and \u201cR.I.P Cole.\u201d\nThey left the bottle of spray paint for others to contribute.\nSpeaking to reporters through tears, the friends said Kinney\u2019s community was grieving his loss. They said he wasn\u2019t involved with gangs and didn\u2019t run with the wrong crowd.\n\u201cHe had just nothing but smiles,\u201d said Jocy Frechette. \u201cEven if there was no party, he was the life of the party. ... He was very known for pushing the envelope.\u201d\n\u201cNo one had anything bad to say about him,\u201d added Rachael Fast, 17.\nThe friends, most of whom knew Kinney from school, said he had been a boxer for some time, but more recently had focused on playing football for the high school.\n\u201cHe was just a wicked down-to-earth kid,\u201d said Bryan Janeczko, 18, of Pelham. \u201cEveryone wanted to be around him.\u201d\nNo specific memorial plans had been made as of early Thursday afternoon.\nA GoFundMe page set up to support Kinney\u2019s family with funeral expenses had already raised more than $16,000 by 8:30 p.m. Thursday.\nOn the page, his sister, Tayla Leigh Kinney, called it the worst day of her life.\nShe said Cole Kinney was exactly two months away from turning 18, when he planned to get his mother\u2019s name as his first tattoo.\n\u201cHis positive vibes and humble self would move mountains,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe was going somewhere in life. He loved boxing, sports, and most of all FAMILY.\u201d\nOfficials are asking anyone with knowledge of the crime to contact State Police Sgt. Brian Strong at (603) 223-8568 or brian.strong@dos.nh.gov.\nUnion Leader Correspondent Hunter McGee contributed to this story.\n."}
