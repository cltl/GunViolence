Mike Ross.\nOfficers obtained a description of the vehicle and spotted a car matching that description shortly afterward near 1300 N. Redwood. \"It fled from officers as they tried to stop it to speak to them about the incident,\" Ross said.\nAs the driver fled, he hit a parked vehicle near 1300 N. Mandalay Road (1910 West), then got out and ran. No one else was seen inside the car. Officers set up a containment in the neighborhood to locate the man and called in a police dog to assist them.\n\u201cWhile we were holding containment, one of our officers had an accidental discharge of his weapon, striking himself,\" Ross said.\nThe officer, whose name was not released, was apparently holding a rifle when it somehow discharged and struck him in the foot.\n\"Nobody else was injured. The officer was taken to a hospital where he received treatment and he\u2019s going to be OK, we hope,\u201d the lieutenant said.\nThe injured officer is new to the department, but previously worked for another police agency.\nOfficers later located a man suspected in the initial shooting incident at his home and detectives were questioning him Saturday, according to Ross.\nTwitter: MisterWestt"}
