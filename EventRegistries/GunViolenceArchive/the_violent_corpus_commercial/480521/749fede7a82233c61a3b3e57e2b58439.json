All are expected to survive, many with wounds to their arms and legs.\nShell casings found around the blood-soaked basketball courts were 7.62 mm rounds, which are traditionally used in AK-47 assault rifles and rarely found in gang attacks on Chicago\u2019s South Side. Though gun violence has long plagued the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods, offenders almost never use military-style weapons.\n\u201cIt's a miracle there has been no fatality,\u201d Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said at a news conference this morning. \u201cIllegal guns, illegal guns, illegal guns drive violence....A military-grade weapon on the streets of Chicago is simply unacceptable.\u201d\nThe park is in a heavily gang-infested area, but it is not in a so-called impact zone flooded by officers to deter crime, McCarthy said. The nearest zones are three blocks to the north and three blocks to the south, leaving the Cornell Square as a no man\u2019s land protected only by occasional patrols and an 11 p.m. curfew.\nAbout 45 minutes before the park\u2019s closing time, at least one gunman walked to the basketball court in the 1800 block of West 51st Street and opened fire, police said. The 13 people hit included both the pick-up game\u2019s players and spectators such as 3-year-old Deonta Howard.\nDeonta, who was standing near the court, was shot near the ear and the bullet exited through his cheek, according to police and relatives. His family said the boy is expected to recover but will need plastic surgery.\nAfter visiting Deonta at Mount Sinai Hospital Friday, his grandmother Semehca Nunn called for an end to the violence that has terrorized her historically working-class neighborhood in recent years.\n\u201cThey need to stop, they need to stop,\u201d Nunn said, before collapsing in tears.\nPolice believe the shooting stemmed from an ongoing dispute between the Black P. Stones and Gangster Disciples. It was not known if any of the victims were the intended targets, authorities said.\n\u201cThere were members of gangs on the scene and there were gang members among the victims,\u201d McCarthy said.\nAuthorities do not have anyone in custody and are currently reviewing police cameras mounted nearby. There could be as many as three offenders, officials said.\nThe first paramedics on scene found more than a dozen people lying across the rust-colored court. One person lay near a bicycle that was on its side. A pair of white gym shoes were left near an out-of-bounds line.\nAmbulances continued to arrive a half hour after the shootings as wounded people \u2013 including a 15-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl \u2013 were carried out on stretchers. About 60 police officers converged on the park and crime lab investigators combed the scene. Witnesses say Deonta was the first to be carried away.\nThe images again captured the world\u2019s attention as international media organizations ran stories about the shooting and foreign reporters attended a Friday morning press conference at police headquarters.\nMcCarthy repeatedly refused to address the incident\u2019s toll on the city\u2019s reputation or his department\u2019s effort to curb gun violence. \u201cEvery time somebody is shot in this city, it\u2019s a setback,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cBut this is not just a Chicago problem.\u201d\nThe incident appeared problematic enough for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to cancel a meeting with Obama administration cabinet secretaries today on city issues and return to Chicago, his spokeswoman Sarah Hamilton said.\nEmanuel flew to D.C. Thursday to raise money for his campaign fund. His East Coast swing also was supposed to include a political fundraiser for Democratic New Jersey U.S. Senate candidate Cory Booker.\nUpon his return, Emanuel spent 40 minutes at Mount Sinai Hospital, where he spoke with Deonta\u2019s mother. The boy, who remains in critical condition, was sedated and being prepared for surgery during the visit.\nThe mayor did not speak with reporters, but released a statement asking the community to cooperate with the investigation.\n\u201cSenseless and brazen acts of violence have no place in Chicago and betray all that we stand for,\u201d Emanuel said in a statement. \u201cThe perpetrators of this crime will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I encourage everyone in the community to step forward with any information and everyone in Chicago to continue their individual efforts to build stronger communities where violence has no place.\u201d\nThe shootings came just days after the FBI released crime data showing that Chicago had more murders than New York in 2012. McCarthy argued Friday that the statistics were old news and did not represent the progress made in the city, where the murder rate has dropped by 20 percent over the past year.\nAld. Willie Cochran, a retired police sergeant whose redrawn ward will include Cornell Square in 2015, acknowledged the shootings landed a damaging blow against the city\u2019s crime-fighting efforts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a setback because we\u2019ve been focusing so much attention on suppressing crime,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at where we were last year and where we are this year, it shows that. But the perception of crime is greater than the crime itself. While law enforcement has been implementing programs, putting more officers on the street on overtime initiatives, it only takes one incident like this to change the whole perception of the reality.\u201d\nFor neighborhood residents, the reality Thursday night included a burst of rapid fire and sight of a bleeding 3-year-old boy. Deonta\u2019s older brother, Jamarrie Toney, was at his aunt\u2019s home across the street from Cornell Square when he heard the shots. He ran to the park\u2019s gate and saw his younger brother lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the face.\nJamarrie, 9, had not seen Deonta \u2013 who goes by the nickname Tay Man \u2013 since paramedics rushed the little boy to the hospital. \u201cI just miss him,\u201d he said.\nAnother victim, a 37-year-old man who was shot in the leg, said he had been hanging around the park with friends when the gunfire began.\n\u201cI turned around, I heard screaming,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI saw Tay Man.\"\nHe paused.\n\u201cI just saw his face. Just tore off. . .they almost shot his whole face off,\u201d he said.\nThe man, who asked that his name not be used, smoked a cigarette as he leaned on a cane after being released from the hospital. Medical tape held down a piece of cotton gauze on his left arm, and he was missing the shoe from the leg where he had also been shot.\nHe denied feeling anger toward the shooter. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful, grateful to be alive,\u201d the man said.\nMayra Rodriguez, 23, who lives in the area with her 2-year-old daughter, heard rapid gunfire and then saw people on the ground. \u201cGood thing most of them got hit in the legs,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\u201cThat kid was playing, he didn\u2019t even know nothing, it was out of nowhere,\u2019\u2019 she said of the 3-year-old.\nRelatives said the boy's uncle, Jerome Howard, was fatally shot in the Woodlawn neighborhood over the Labor Day weekend. The Rev. Corey Brooks, who presided over Howard's funeral, urged the shooter or shooters to surrender or face justice on the streets.\n\u201cThere are people who know exactly who the shooter is,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I'm sure he will not be safe shooting 13 people.\u201d\nAs dawn broke today, broken glass could be seen strewn across the basketball court, along with discarded medical supplies, syringes without needles, plastic packaging, orange gloves and a bloody T-shirt.\nBefore Thursday night's shooting, eight children under the age of 8 had been shot in Chicago over seven weeks.\nPolice listed the victims as:\n\u2022 A 3-year-old boy, shot in the ear, in critical condition at Mount Sinai\n\u2022 A 17-year-old girl, shot in the foot, condition stabilized at Holy Cross Hospital\n\u2022 A 15-year-old boy shot in the arm, stabilized at Holy Cross\n\u2022 A man, 27, shot in the leg and wrist, serious condition at Mount Sinai\n\u2022 A man, 24, shot twice in the stomach, serious condition at Mount Sinai\n\u2022 A man, 21, shot in the leg, serious condition at Mount Sinai\n\u2022 A man, 41, shot in the buttocks, serious condition at John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital\n\u2022 A woman, 33, shot in the shoulder, condition stabilized at Northwestern Memorial Hospital\n\u2022 A man, 31, shot in the buttocks, condition stabilized at Northwestern\n\u2022 A woman, 23, shot in the foot, condition stabilized at St. Anthony Hospital\n\u2022 A man, 37, shot in the leg, in good condition at Stroger\n\u2022 A man, 25, shot in the knee, in good condition at Northwestern\n\u2022 And a man, 33, who drove himself to Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park with a gunshot wound to the leg and who was treated and released."}
