(CBS4) \u2013 A 14-year-old boy who was shot inside a home in Littleton on Friday afternoon has died, and a 15-year-old is in custody in the case.\nThe Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office said the suspect was arrested on suspicion of first-degree assault.\nDeputies found the injured teen at the home, which is located near the intersection of West Bowles Avenue and South Simms Street. He was taken immediately to the hospital.\nThe 15-year-old suspect allegedly fled from the scene and was taken into custody by deputies a mile away near Dakota Ridge Apartments.\n\u201cWe do know that the two teenage boys knew one another, that possibly they were good friends,\u201d said Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s spokesman Mark Techmeyer.\nInvestigators say they have conducted several interviews in an attempt to figure out what led to the shooting. They said Friday night it\u2019s unclear so far if the shooting was accidental or intentional and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if any adults were home at the time."}
