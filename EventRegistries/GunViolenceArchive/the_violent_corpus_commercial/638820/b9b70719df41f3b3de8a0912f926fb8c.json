And although investigators say the boy shot himself, there is still someone they want to talk to.\n\"We\u2019re looking for Braindon Keith murphy,\u201d said officer Haley Walters with the Beaumont Police Department. \u201cHe is an 18-year-old Beaumont man, he is just a person in interest wanted in questioning in reference to the shooting.\"\nThe neighbor says it's a scary situation, knowing it could easily happen to his three young nephews.\n\"If they wanted to go over there and play with the other kid over there and they had saw the gun, they would have thought it was a bb gun or a toy, and they would have picked it up and started shooting at people,\" said the neighbor.\nOfficer Walter has a warning for parents.\n\"If you do have weapons in your home, keep them away where children can't get to them,\u201d said Walters. \u201cChildren are quick and quiet and they can get into those tiny spaces that you wouldn't think they can get into.\"\nIt's a message echoed by others.\n\"Keep weapons away from kids at all times,\" said the neighbor."}
