Because if I can't hate him ... that means you have the right not to hate him.\nShe said Caleb was wise beyond his years.\n\"Caleb was a smart, sweet, funny kid,\" Demetrius Harris said.\nServices for Caleb are planned for Thursday.\nPolice said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with Pearson\u2019s death, and that Weaver is cooperating with authorities."}
