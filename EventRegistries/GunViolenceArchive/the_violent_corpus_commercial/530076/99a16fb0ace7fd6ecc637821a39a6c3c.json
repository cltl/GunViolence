She died of multiple gunshot wounds. Her death was a homicide.\nAwakened Sunday by frantic banging on his front door on Riverview in the Old Redford area of the city, Craig Gebhardt wondered what had disturbed the quiet of his neighborhood, especially so early, and on Easter.\n\u201cCan you call 911?\u201d he said a distraught young man was begging him, just after 2 a.m.\nThe shooting on the 16800 block of Riverview near West McNichols and Telegraph killed a 3-year-old and injured the young man\u2019s father, a 39-year-old, and another man, 26, police said.\nGebhardt, 63, who has been part of the Old Redford neighborhood for more than 15 years, said he\u2019s had suspicions about the goings-on at the home.\nGebhardt and other neighbors, including a landlord on the street, said they believe it was a targeted, not random, shooting. Police would not address a motive.\n\u201cFrom 8 or 9 at night to 4 in the morning, you might see 30 cars a night (at the house),\u201d he said. \u201cThey pull up, go inside, and come right back out.\u201d\nSome people\u2019s stays are so short they didn\u2019t even turn off their headlights, Gebhardt said.\nDetroit Police Sgt. Michael Woody said there were others in the home at the time when a man kicked in the front door about 2:10 a.m. Sunday.\n\u201cOnce inside the suspect opened fired and struck the 3-year-old girl,\u201d Woody said.\nWoody said the 39-year-old man was in critical condition and the 26-year-old was in stable condition.\nA neighbor who would refer to herself only as Miss Jackson also received a request to call 911. Relatively new to the neighborhood, Jackson said she has been concerned with the amount of traffic the home has attracted.\nBut she didn\u2019t move from the home on the block. And she doesn\u2019t plan to now, she said.\n\u201cMy faith is in God,\u201d she said, adding that the house where the violence took place is \u201cpart of the problem.\u201d\n\u201cThey know the person who did that,\u201d Jackson said.\nGebhardt is similarly undeterred.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one in a million thing,\u201d he said.\nWoody said the shooter fled the scene by foot and then got into a white or gray Grand Marquis.\nHe is described as 6 feet one inch tall with a medium complexion and slim build. He was wearing gray clothing.\nDennis Bosak, a landlord who said he rents eight homes in Old Redford, said he\u2019d been warning police of suspicious activity at the house since last summer.\nBosak said to be a successful landlord in the neighborhood, \u201cyou have to be defensive\u201d about keeping property secure. That means security cameras and motion detectors.\n\u201cI might not be able to stop crime, but I can make someone want to look past my house,\u201d Bosak said.\nHe describes Riverview as \u201ca quiet street, except for one house\u201d \u2014 the scene of the shooting.\nPreviously, in emails to Detroit police, Bosak laid out his concerns in detail.\nIn one email, Bosak gave the make, model and license plate number of a car he believed was involved in suspicious activity and describes the activity:\n\u201cCar drives up, beeps the horn, young guy with a cane walks out, something transpires \u2014 can\u2019t see what. Car leaves. Young guy goes back in house.\u201d\nDetroit police tell a different story. There was no inaction, says Sgt. Michael Woody \u2014 just an inability to prove anything meriting a police response was actually taking place.\nPolice did not respond to a single 911 call in 2015 involving the home, Woody said. In fact, there were none since a 2012 break-in. Efforts to send plainclothes officers to investigate the situation didn\u2019t turn up probable cause. There were no calls placed on the home to (313) 224-DOPE, the city\u2019s hotline to report illegal drug activity, Woody said.\n\u201cWe did our due diligence,\u201d Woody said Monday, adding that city hall\u2019s Department of Neighborhoods was even involved. \u201cBut having a lot of people visit a house does not necessarily mean anything illegal was happening.\u201d\nBosak said he\u2019s been inside of the site of the shooting and calls it \u201cuninhabitable.\u201d The home, he said, has no kitchen sink, refrigerator, stove or even tables in the downstairs area. No place for a child.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go upstairs,\u201d he said.\nJackson said she saw the little girl playing in the front yard Saturday. Gebhardt did, too.\n\u201cI saw her, and she waved, and then I waved,\u201d he said. \u201cTen hours later, she was dead.\u201d\njdickson@detroitnews.com"}
