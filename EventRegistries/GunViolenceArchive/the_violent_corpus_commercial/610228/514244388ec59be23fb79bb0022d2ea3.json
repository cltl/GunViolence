Crime scene investigators were seen collecting a bloody piece of clothing.\n7News cameras captured Torres\u2019 mother breaking down just beyond the police tape. Moments later, an officer could be seen comforting her.\nThe man who, police said, was the shooter, was transported to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators later identified him as 55-year-old Roberto Alfonso Jr. and confirmed he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nThe child was transported to JMH in stable condition. He is expected to be OK. Officials said his injuries were not life-threatening, and he is scheduled to be released later this week, possibly on Thursday.\nInvestigators confirmed that this was a domestic situation but did not specify whether the deceased were a couple. They said the child is Torres\u2019 son but is not related to Alfonso.\nGretchen Avello, a friend and former co-worker of Torres, is still reeling from the tragedy. \u201cOh, my goodness, incredible,\u201d she told 7News on Monday. \u201cShe\u2019s very young.\u201d\nAccording to court documents, domestic violence had been an ongoing issue between Torres and Alfonso. Records revealed there have been instances of domestic discord as recently as June.\nTorres said this is the first time he\u2019s seen such an incident in this neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 27 years, and it\u2019s been calm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been calm like any other neighborhood. I haven\u2019t seen this, though.\u201d\n\u201cNobody should take the life of another person,\u201d said Avello. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very, very, very sad.\u201d\nThe Florida Department of Children and Families is reviewing the case to determine who will take custody of the child. A hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday.\nCopyright 2017 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."}
