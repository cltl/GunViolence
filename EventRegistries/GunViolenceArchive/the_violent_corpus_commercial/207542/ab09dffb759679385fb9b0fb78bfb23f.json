Two weeks ago the names of two students killed in a traffic accident were spray-painted on. Now the name of Austin Hedrick has been added. He died Friday night after a rifle accidentally discharged in the truck he was riding in.\n\"It's a tragedy for the whole community\" said Lt. Aaron Turk with the Catawba County Sheriff's Office. Turk is leading the investigation into what happened. Though officials believe it was an accident, they still want to know why there was a loaded rifle in the truck and exactly what happened to cause it to fire.\nThe weapon in question is a \"youth sized\" .223 caliber, single shot rifle. Experts say that type of weapon requires the hammer to be pulled back and the trigger pulled to cause it to fire.\nThree people were in the front seat of the Mazda truck Friday night including Austin, his father and another teen. The rifle was in between the two teens and barrel up when it fired, said investigators. It happened along Hudson Chapel Road just after 11pm.\nAt Bunker Hill High on Monday, counselors were on hand to help students and teachers through the grieving process. \"It was real tough here today,\" said Cameron Blakely, a friend of Austin's. \"He was such a good guy and fun to be around.\" School officials say it has been a shock to the students to lose three students in two weeks and the entire community has felt the loss too.\n\"It has been very difficult,\" said football coach Travis Conner. \"We have, in fact, lost 7 close members of the Bunker Hill High Community\nin just a few weeks,\" he said. Besides the three students, a former student, a former teacher, and two staunch supports have died recently, one in an accident, the others from illness.\nConner said the only way people were getting through it was by their faith and by leaning on each other. \"God is in this community and he is holding everyone right now,\" he said.\nBlakely said students are definitely in shock over the tragedies of recent weeks. \"We're never gonna forget all these tragic events that have been happening,\" he said.\nCopyright 2014 WBTV.
