We need the community\u2019s help to solve homicide number 150.\u201d\nCharderious Fennell was found in the 4100 block of Meadow Creek by people looking to rent the house, Frias said. He\u2019d been shot more than once.\nThe teenager had moved from South Memphis and been living in the neighborhood about three or four months, Frias said. He attended Airways Middle School and didn\u2019t have any known associates in the area, Frias said. Asked if the teen was in a gang, he said that\u2019s part of the investigation.\nFrias asked people with tips in the case to call 528-CASH or the homicide office at 636-3300.\nThe detective\u2019s news conference was unusual in Memphis, a city in which the police department rarely makes investigators available for comment on active cases. .\nThe teenager is one of a total of at least 22 people under 18 who have died of homicide so far this year in Memphis, according to The Commercial Appeal\u2019s Homicide Tracker. The youngest were fetuses. The homicide figure doesn\u2019t include the four small children who died in July in an apartment complex just outside the city limits, allegedly at the hands of their mother."}
