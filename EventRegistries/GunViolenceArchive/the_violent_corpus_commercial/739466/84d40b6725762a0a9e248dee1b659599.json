(AP) - A 15-year-old central Pennsylvania youth has been ordered to stand trial in the shooting death of a 17-year-old on New Year's Eve.\nPennLive.com reports that the teenager waived his right to a preliminary hearing Tuesday in Franklin County in the death of Matthew Mitchell in Greencastle.\nAuthorities allege in charging documents that the defendant felt he was being picked on, so he grabbed his father's gun from the nightstand to try to scare the older youth.\nInvestigators allege that he chambered a round but put the gun on the floor, then later picked it up, dropped the magazine out, pointed it at the victim's head and pulled the trigger.\nThe youth told investigators that he didn't know the gun was loaded and hadn't intended to kill the victim."}
