During an evening press conference, LAPD Sgt. Barry Montgomery said authorities received a call regarding a man with a gun in the area.\nMontgomery said gang unit officers working at the time responded to the area and conducted a search, but did not find anyone. As they were clearing the area, they noticed two men walking down the street and one of the men matched the description of the suspect in the call.\nThe officers tried to make contact, police said, and an officer-involved shooting occurred. One of the men was struck by gunfire and was taken to a nearby hospital where he later died.\nWitnesses said they heard about three to four shots. One witness, Tiffany Peterson, said officers did not say anything when they approached the man and shot him.\n\"He had his arms to the side when they jumped out. They didn't say nothing. They didn't give him no kind of orders,\" she said. \"The police officer in front of him shot him one time. He fell on the ground and then the officer that was in front of him took two steps and shot him three more times.\nAuthorities said the male suspect was shot once. The second man was taken into custody, Montgomery said. Both men were between the ages of 18 and 22, police said.\nNo officers were injured in the shooting, and police said a gun was recovered at the scene.\nThe investigation is ongoing.\nThe shooting occurred not far from where an 18-year-old man was killed in an officer-involved shooting after police said he fled from a suspected stolen car."}
