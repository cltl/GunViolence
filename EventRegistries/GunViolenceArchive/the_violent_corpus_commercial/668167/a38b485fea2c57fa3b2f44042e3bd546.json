The caller reported a man with a gun matching Perez\u2019s description, Beck said.\nOne of Perez\u2019s parents believes it was the teenager on the recorded call, the chief added.\nBased on that call, the note, Perez\u2019s actions and his \u201cprior history\u201d described by family, Beck said he believed the shooting stemmed from Perez\u2019s \u201cdesire to end his own life.\u201d Beck declined to detail that history, saying he would not \u201cput this family through any more trauma.\u201d\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by these events,\u201d the chief said. \u201cThe tragedy is hard to describe.\u201d\nThe officer who shot Perez, Beck said, \u201cis devastated.\u201d\nIt was the second deadly shooting by LAPD officers during a roughly 24-hour span, coming soon after the controversial shooting of 18-year-old Carnell Snell Jr., which prompted protests and stirred long-standing frustrations over how police treat residents of South L.A.\nOn Sunday, during a second night of demonstrations over Snell\u2019s death, news spread of the second police shooting.\nOfficers went to 48th Street and Ascot Avenue after someone reported a man with a gun in the area, Beck said earlier this week. The officers spotted someone matching that description \u2014 a Latino man with a gray sweater and black pants \u2014 and began to approach him, Beck said.\nThat person, now identified as Perez, then turned and pointed a handgun at the officers, Beck said, prompting police to open fire.\nParamedics took Perez to a hospital, where he died later that evening.\nThe gun turned out to be a replica weapon, with its orange tip covered by black paint or pen, Beck said.\nPolice initially described the person shot as a man between the ages of 18 and 22. A second person near the scene was initially detained and questioned but did not know Perez or see the shooting, Beck said.\nThe officers who shot Perez were wearing body cameras. Beck said Thursday he had \u201cno immediate intention\u201d of releasing that footage, which he said \u201cclearly depicts his actions and his death, which are entirely consistent with the officers\u2019 version of events.\u201d\nOne woman who said she watched the shooting from her family\u2019s home across the street told The Times that Perez appeared to put his arms by his side, but that she could not see his hands. Tiffany Peterson, 45, said police fired again when Perez was on the ground.\nBeck said earlier this week that the body camera footage \u201cclearly refutes\u201d reports Perez was shot while on the ground.\n\u201cThat did not happen,\u201d he added.\nIn a rare move earlier this week, Beck released a security video from the moments leading up to Snell\u2019s shooting, which showed the 18-year-old holding a handgun. Beck said Snell later turned toward officers while holding the gun, prompting them to fire.\nMany activists and residents of Snell\u2019s neighborhood have questioned the police account of the shooting, including whether he had a gun.\nBeck, generally a staunch advocate of keeping such videos confidential, said he released that footage out of concern for public safety as well as to correct what he described as \u201csignificant misinformation\u201d about the events leading up to Snell\u2019s death.\nFollow me on Twitter: @katemather\nALSO\nSlain deputy mourned \u2014 even by those he arrested\nLong Beach police believe man caught on video shot and killed mother and 4-year-old daughter\n\u2018It\u2019s like living in a war zone': Westmont grows more weary of violence after police shooting\nUPDATES:\n5:42 p.m.: This story was updated with additional comments from LAPD Chief Charlie Beck about the shooting and body camera footage.\n3:35 p.m. This story was updated with comments from LAPD Chief Charlie Beck and news of the \u201cfarewell note.\u201d\nThis story was originally published at 11:50 a.m."}
