The filing says an Uzi was not a safe or appropriate weapon to entrust to a young girl and caused her to lose control of it.\nThe range is located in northwestern Arizona, about 60 miles south of Las Vegas.\n\u201cI hope that this will teach them a lesson,\u201d Vacca\u2019s daughter Elizabeth Vacca, 17, told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV. \u201cI think someone really needs to learn something from what happened in this situation. Someone needs to take accountability.\u201d\nA woman who answered the phone Wednesday and didn\u2019t disclose her name said the range was under new ownership and she didn\u2019t know anything about the lawsuit.\nThe shooting led to a debate over youngsters and guns, with many people wondering why parents would let a child handle a submachine gun. The girl\u2019s parents have released statements expressing sympathy for Vacca\u2019s family, but they have not said why they let the child shoot the Uzi.\nThe range\u2019s owner previously said the parents had signed waivers saying they understood the rules and were standing nearby. Prosecutors declined to file charges.\nVacca instructed the girl on how to fire the gun, showed her a shooting stance and helped her fire a few rounds, according to police reports.\nHe then stepped back and let her hold the Uzi by herself. She fired the gun, and its recoil wrenched the Uzi upward, killing Vacca with a shot to the head. The 39-year-old was flown to a Las Vegas hospital, where he died.\nAn investigation by the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health found no serious violations at the outdoor shooting range. But the agency recommended it have a safety officer, limit weapon selections for certain shooters and ensure shooters are comfortable with weapons before they are placed on automatic."}
