The caller immediately hung up. The dispatcher recognized the number as belonging to Fish Wildlife and Parks (FWP) Sergeant Joe Knarr. The dispatcher notified two Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s deputies who were responding Knarr\u2019s residence, 341 Golden Trout Way, in Gallatin County. The deputies found that the house was locked. Dispatch made several attempts to call Joe Knarr\u2019s number, and his wife, FWP Warden Jen Knarr\u2019s, number, but no one answered any of the calls. The deputy looked through a window and saw a person\u2019s legs lying on the floor in the residence. The deputies then had to kick open the front door and entered the residence. When the deputies entered into the dining room of the residence they immediately saw two bodies on the floor. Joe Knarr and Jen Knarr were deceased, both having suffered gunshot wounds. When the deputies looked elsewhere in the house, they found six month old Daniel Knarr. They immediately removed Daniel and attempted resuscitation with a volunteer firefighter but were unsuccessful.\n[PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING IS VERY GRAPHIC IN NATURE]\nThe investigation and evidence indicated that Jen Knarr walked behind Joe who was sitting in the dining room and shot him in the back of the head. She then walked to Daniel and shot him in the chest. This was when Jen called 911, hung up, sat down and shot herself. Deputies recovered a Sig Sauer model 229 .40 caliber handgun. That weapon was issued to Jen Knarr by FWP as her duty weapon. Three shell casings were found in the Knarr residence. When Sheriff Brian Gootkin spoke with family members they all indicated that Jen had been battling postpartum depression. All three individuals were transported to the State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office for autopsies. The investigation will continue.\n___________________________________________________________________________\nWhile a shocking headline, few details are known at this time.\nWhat we do know has been provided by the Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s Office press release:\nThe Gallatin County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to a 911 hang up call East of Bozeman at 5:00 P.M. this evening.
