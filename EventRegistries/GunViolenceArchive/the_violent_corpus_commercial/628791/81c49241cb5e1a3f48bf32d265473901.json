A 16-year-old girl also was hit, but her injuries were not life-threatening.\nPolice have not said what they think led to the shootings. One boy was declared dead soon after reaching the hospital, and the second boy died later.\nOne witness told The Star he saw a man dressed in a white T-shirt and black sweatpants rush out of the College Avenue house, followed by another man. The two jumped into a pickup parked up the street and sped away.\nPolice continued their investigation Monday. The deaths were the city\u2019s 66th and 67th homicides of the year.\n\u201cThey have destroyed grandmothers, aunts, cousins, brothers and sisters \u2014 there are so many of us who are hurting,\u201d said Ross, Montell\u2019s grandmother. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do. They hurt us, they hurt our babies. They hurt my grandkids. He was the baby boy, and now he won\u2019t be back.\u201d\nThe boys lived with a number of relatives in the small frame house on the east side of College Avenue. No one answered the door Monday.\nJayden had recently entered the fourth grade at Hogan Preparatory Academy, and Montell was in the third grade. The two started classes last week.\nSeveral social workers were on hand Monday to help students as they grieved for their slain classmates.\n\u201cThey were great kids,\u201d said school Superintendent Danny Tipton. \u201cI know that a lot of people say that when someone passes, but man, they were just good kids. They were outgoing and really good kids.\u201d\nSocial workers and school administrators visited each classroom to counsel students.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking it one step at a time,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cThe ones who were in their classes are taking it pretty darn hard.\u201d\nThe 16-year-old victim, who is in the 11th grade at Hogan Prep, was in class Monday.\n\u201cShe is doing as well as could be expected,\u201d Tipton said. \u201cShe just wanted to get back to her normal routine as soon as possible. She has a lot of friends at school, and this is a safe place for her to be.\u201d\nRoss said Montell was a mama\u2019s boy who still occasionally sucked his thumb. He liked playing video games and watching cartoons. He and Jayden were inseparable, Ross said.\n\u201cHe was just a happy kid,\u201d she said.\nNeighbor Ana Garcia said Jayden and Montell were frequent visitors to her home. They would march over to ask if her younger sons could play.\nShe said she was at work early Saturday when she received a frantic phone call from her 14-year-old son. He\u2019d heard the gunshots and then a woman screaming, \u201cMy baby, my baby,\u201d Garcia said.\nShe told her son to find a spot inside their house to take cover until he felt safe.\nAnother neighbor, Berchard Fountain, had just brought his two dogs back inside when the gunfire sent him ducking for cover on his front porch.\n\u201cIt was about 20 to 25 shots,\u201d Fountain said. \u201cI laid on the porch, and I got up when the shooting stopped.\u201d\nHe said a boy about 10 years old jumped out a window of the house, ran to Fountain\u2019s place and banged on the front door.\n\u201c \u2018They\u2019re shooting my family, they\u2019re shooting my family,\u2019 \u201d Fountain said the boy yelled at him. \u201c \u2018Call 911. Call 911.\u2019 \u201d\nFountain let the boy inside his home to make the call. He didn\u2019t let the boy leave until police arrived.\nGarcia said her children were still shaken Monday.\n\u201cThey are still a little scared,\u201d she said. \u201cMy little girl is scared \u2014 last night she asked if we could move because she is scared.\u201d\nGlenn E.
