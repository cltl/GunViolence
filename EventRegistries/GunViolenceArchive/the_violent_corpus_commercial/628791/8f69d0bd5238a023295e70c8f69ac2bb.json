They were taken to a hospital, where the boys died.\n\"Very sad. No child should lose his life,\" said neighbor Vernon Trice. \"And since I have two young boys myself, no child should lose their life.\"\nThe girl was expected to recover.\nPolice said the boys were cousins.\nKansas City Mayor Sly James said the gun violence in the city is an ongoing frustration. He said he believes many shootings could be prevented through a better focus on the problems of poverty and education.\n\"That is our fault, that is a shame on the leadership of this country, this state wherever, that we don't do what we know needs to be done,\" James said.\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477."}
