One neighbor said she heard them around 1 a.m., and she didn\u2019t want to look out the window.\nGladys Garland has been checking her mail on the front porch of her 13th Avenue home for nine years. She raised her children in the home across the street.\n\"Everybody was close knit. Everybody knew everybody. It was a joy because we didn't have to worry,\u201d Garland said.\nOver the years her neighbors have changed, sights look different, but sounds have become more familiar to her.\n\"Quite a bit. Especially on the weekend,\u2019 Garland said.\nGarland heard the gunshots early Wednesday morning come from across the street.\nThe shooting sent a 10 year old to the hospital. Family members of the young girl say they were at home when they heard the shots fired.\nThe girl\u2019s aunt says the child was sleeping on the couch and didn\u2019t realize she had been shot. Her aunt tells 10TV over the phone the bullet hit her back and went through her.\nEast 13th Avenue is now the fifth location that\u2019s been wrapped in crime tape. Five shootings, four days three people dead and more are injured.\n\"I think that there has to be a change for the better, quick because we should not have to live where we are worried and concerned about our next door neighbors,\u201d Garland said.\nGarland says she\u2019s thinking of moving, but she doesn\u2019t to. She says she loves her neighborhood, despite the change.\n\"I just pray. Ask God to watch over us and protect us,\u201d she said.\nInvestigators have not released any suspect information for the East 13th Avenue shooting.\nColumbus police have not said if these shootings are gang related or connected at all."}
