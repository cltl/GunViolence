Swain, who authorities say was shot four times, is expected to survive.\nFirefighters had gone to the Temple Hills home after the brother of the man who lived there told authorities he was concerned about the man\u2019s safety, said Mark Brady, spokesman for the fire department. The man said his brother had trouble controlling his blood sugar and recently blacked out. He told authorities he was worried because his brother wasn\u2019t answering the phone or the door and his car was parked in the driveway, Brady said.\nWhen the firefighters arrived on the scene, the person inside was unresponsive, so they decided to force entry, police said. As that was happening, the person inside fired several rounds, striking two firefighters and his brother, authorities said. Police said that once officers got into the home, the gunfire stopped.\nThere were no police officers present when the firefighters decided to enter the home, Prince George\u2019s County Police Department spokeswoman Julie Parker.\nBrady said that\u2019s something firefighters do fairly routinely when there\u2019s a concern about someone\u2019s safety. He said anytime there is an incident such as this, the department will review its protocols and possibly make changes.\n\u201cThe firefighter medics made a decision that this was indeed a reason they needed to get into that house as soon as possible. Time could have been of the essence,\u201d he said.\nAs of Saturday, no charges had been brought against the shooter and he was released from police custody Saturday evening, according to a statement tweeted by the police department.\nBrady said Ulmschneider was described as a \u201cgood old hard working country boy who loved his job.\u201d\nDiana Krieger, whose daughter is married to Ulmschneider\u2019s brother, told The Washington Post that he was a \u201ccaring man\u201d who had dreamed of being a firefighter since high school.\n\u201cHe wanted to help others, he loved doing what he was doing, being a paramedic and a firefighter, and I really believe that he was doing God\u2019s work,\u201d Krieger told the newspaper.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan ordered the state\u2019s flag to be flown at half-staff in Ulmschneider\u2019s memory.\n\u201cHis legacy as a husband, father and firefighter, and his commitment to protecting others, will not soon be forgotten by his loved ones, the community, or Maryland,\u201d Hogan said in a statement.\nThe brother of the man who lived at the home was not seriously injured, Prince George\u2019s County police Chief Henry P. Stawinski III said at a news conference. The person who was inside the home was in custody and cooperating with police, he said. Police have not released their names.\nTwo other firefighters with the Morningside Volunteer Fire Department suffered minor injuries while seeking cover after the shooting. He says one firefighter injured a knee and the other injured her jaw. The two were treated at the hospital and released Saturday.\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the slain firefighter\u2019s name is Ulmschneider, not Ulmshneider, and that he was 37 years old, not 39."}
