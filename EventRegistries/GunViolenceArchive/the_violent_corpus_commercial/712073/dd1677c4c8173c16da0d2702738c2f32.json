He said Matis and victim Parker Hess were friends.\nMatis is currently in jail on charges of criminal homicide and reckless endangerment.\nPrevious coverage of this story here & here\nAP via WTAE-TV:\nHess was shot when Matis removed his legally owned gun from a holster and it fired, striking Hess in the cheek, state police said in a criminal complaint. Investigators haven\u2019t said whether the shooting was accidental, but Davis believes it was.\n\u201cMr. Matis is distraught over all this,\u201d Davis told The Associated Press. \u201cThis is a horrific incident and of course it\u2019s our position that this was just a terrible accident.\u201d\nThe homicide charge Matis faces allows prosecutors to pursue a murder conviction, but also voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, which occurs when a shooting was reckless or grossly negligent. Davis said he expects the case will be prosecuted under a manslaughter statute, but didn\u2019t want to presume anything.\nArrangement for Parker Hess from the Republic Volunteer Fire Company:\nFriends will be received in the Robert T Kish Funeral Home. 1 legion. St, Republic PA.\nThursday from 2:00 to 8:00. FF service at 8pm.\nAnd Friday in the First Christian Church of New Salem 800 New Salem rd. Uniontown Pa. From 10am to 11am."}
