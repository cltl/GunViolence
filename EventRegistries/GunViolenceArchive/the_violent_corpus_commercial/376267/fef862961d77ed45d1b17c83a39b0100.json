She would have turned 2 years old on July 24, relative Jasmine Washington said.\nCarilion officials had no information on Quesenberry\u2019s condition or status as a patient as of Friday afternoon.\nRoanoke police spokesman Scott Leamon said the department is not releasing additional information about the victims\u2019 injuries due to the investigation. He also declined to say whether either victim was conscious and whether Aryah was alive when police arrived on scene.\nWarner Lovings Hunter III, 25, was arrested by state police at a house in Covington about 1 a.m. He was taken to Roanoke City Jail, where he remains without bond. He is charged with second-degree murder and malicious wounding.\nThe victims were shot in the street in front of Hunter\u2019s home. Hunter fled in a 2007 silver Mazda, according to police.\nWashington, the mother of Aryah\u2019s second cousin, said she had not met Hunter prior to the shooting and was unaware that Quesenberry had been in a relationship with him. Washington said Aryah and her 2-year-old daughter often played together.\n\u201cShe was a sweet baby,\u201d Washington said. \u201cThey would dance together all the time. Any song you play, when they heard music they had to dance.\u201d\nJennifer Stewart, a neighbor who lives close to Hunter\u2019s residence, said she was watching television when she heard the shots. She said she heard two shots fired together and a third fired a few seconds later.\n\u201cIt was really scary when I came outside and realized it wasn\u2019t fireworks, it was actually gunshots,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI was standing on my sidewalk and I could hear a woman screaming. I heard a little boy screaming for his mom and saw a police officer carrying a child with no shirt and no shoes on to a police car.\u201d\nLeamon said a second child was placed in the care of other family members. Additional information about that child was not immediately available.\nStewart said she has never interacted with Hunter, Quesenberry or any children in the residence. She said Thursday\u2019s shooting is the only time in the eight years she\u2019s lived in the neighborhood that she remembers a violent crime taking place.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures on the news of the suspect and I don\u2019t even recognize that person,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThis kind of thing just doesn\u2019t happen here. We have kids doing Easter egg hunts and vacation Bible school right across the street.\u201d\nLeah Fleming, another neighbor, said she had only spoken with Hunter in passing since he arrived in the neighborhood about two years ago. Fleming first noticed Hunter taking walks with Aryah six months ago.\n\u201cHe was always a real nice, quiet guy. He kept to himself,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cHe would say \u2018Hey, what\u2019s up?\u2019 But we never had a full conversation.\u201d"}
