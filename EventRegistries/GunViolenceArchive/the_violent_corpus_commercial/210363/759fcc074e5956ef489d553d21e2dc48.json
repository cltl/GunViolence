It\u2019s unclear if Galasso was the love interest.\n\u201cYou would think there was some animosity that caused it, but they were the best of friends, they were like brothers,\u201d Don Hatch, Nate\u2019s grandfather, told Reuters. \u201cAll of us wonder why, but we are trying to pray together and heal and forge on.\u201d\nGalasso was remembered as outgoing and vibrant by friends who took to social media to mourn her passing.\n\u201cWorkout clothes feel great to wear to school,\u201d she tweeted that morning.\nAnd just last weekend, at a dance where Jaylen Fryberg was named homecoming prince, Galasso tweeted a photo of herself with Andrew, in formalwear with boutonnieres in place, smiling and holding hands.\n\u201cMy favorite,\u201d she captioned the snap, beside a smiley face with hearts in place of the eyes.\nA family friend raised $15,000 in one day online to help with funeral costs.\n\u201cZoe was very outgoing,\u201d 14-year-old Lukas Thorington told The Seattle Times. \u201cShe was into sports. She was nice and awesome. She was fun to hang out with.\u201d\nWith News Wire Services"}
