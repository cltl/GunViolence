Galveston EMS and Galveston Fire Dept also arrived along with police and immediately began treating the child before transporting him to the John Sealy Emergency Room at UTMB.\nDetectives with the Galveston Police Major Crimes Division as well investigators with the Crime Scene Unit responded to the scene and began interviewing the family and witnesses and also started processing the scene for forensic evidence. Preliminary investigation indicates that the child unintentionally discharged the gun, striking himself in the forehead. The child's condition is still being assessed at this time; however, the bullet appeared to have caused a deep laceration, grazing the skull.\nThis case is still in its infancy and detectives are still working to assure that no one else was involved in the shooting and to confirm who was on location at the time of the incident. Detectives are also working closely with the Galveston County District Attorney's Office to determine the appropriate level of criminal action to be taken.\nInformation from:\nSgt Joshua Schirard\nComments:\nAnother TV op for old Henry, the Sheila Jackson-Lee of Galveston. Note his name was not even mentioned in the GDN, his hometown newspaper. Feel bad for the little one and pray he is going to be fine.\nNow the parents or guardians of this young child should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law!!! And the child should be placed in a SAFE home where he will have half of a chance to grow up with out any more gun shot wounds!!!! I cannot believe how some of you 'rush to judgement' and wish ill and prosecution to these parent when you know absolutely nothing about the case. Talk about narrow mindedness and judgmental, that's what you are. HPD...you are so right. It is unfortunate that so many come to a quick judgement. Before another is condemned, ALL the facts should be in allowing for a proper conclusion. Let the investigating agency get all the facts before we grab for a rope. Besides being a violation of state law, incidents like this show a lack of responsibility and common sense to make a firearm accessible to a child. I personally know this family, and you are correct Slappy, they should be prosecuted to the fullest. Both his mother and grandmother are irresponsible drug addicts, this is FACT, just check the local bars, 52nd and Ave S. It's widely known that child runs around there all the time unsupervised while his \"guardians\" are doing drugs and getting drunk. A simple UA will prove why that child needs to be taken away ASAP! It does not take a WHOLE LOT OF COMMON SENSE!!! to place blame on the caregivers in a situation like this. A child shooting him/her self SHOULD NOT EVER and I repeat EVER!!! HAPPEN!!! The caregivers are not paying attention when something like this happens!! THE END!!! I repeat the child should be placed somewhere where he has a half of a chance to grow up without any more gun shot wounds!!!!! Take this child and his baby sister away. One thorough look into the background of his parental control will prove these children are in danger and have been since birth. What parent who's child was just shot in the head posts pictures of it on Facebook? Oh, that's right, his own mother does looking for sympathy! Grandma goes to the hospital with chest pains, I bet she did, cause she knows the hammer is about to come down on them! BW is nothing but a meal ticket to them. Sickening! If law enforcement doesn't do something about it this time, BW won't be so lucky next time. May those poor children have enough people on their side to stand up and rally against these horrible people he calls grandma and mom. This isn't the first time he's been hurt, and certainly won't be the last until this mom and grandma are looked into, deeply. Well, I guess that answers the needed questions.\nTake the child away. sad thing about this is cps gets involved kids go back to be put in danger again.
