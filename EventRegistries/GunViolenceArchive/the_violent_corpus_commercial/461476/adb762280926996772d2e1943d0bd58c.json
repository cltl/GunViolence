Officers did not release the names or conditions of the three people wounded in Tuesday's shooting.\nReligious leaders in the neighborhood called the incident a horrifying act.\n\"(There's) potential for a lot of kids to be out in the street, bullets flying,\" pastor and community outreach advocate Peterson Mingo of the Cincinnati Human Relations Committee. \"It's just total disregard for human life.\"\n\u201cThings like this are going to happen as long as we say nothing. As long as we stay silent and there's only one way to stop it. We have to stop it,\u201d Mingo said .\nThis corner of Cincinnati's west side is no stranger to multi-victim shootings. The intersection was also the sight of two back-to-back shootings in a single night last May that resulted in four people wounded. Another shooting at the same intersection left another person injured just two days later.\nPolice did not say what led to the gun fight Tuesday evening, nor have any suspects been identified.\nWCPO will update this story as it develops.\nOpen full screen to view moreSign inShooting on Cincinnati's west side26,824 viewsMade with Google My MapsShooting on Cincinnati's west side\nMap data \u00a92017 Google\nTerms\n2,000 ftCreate new mapOpen mapShared with youHelpFeedbackGoogle Drive"}
