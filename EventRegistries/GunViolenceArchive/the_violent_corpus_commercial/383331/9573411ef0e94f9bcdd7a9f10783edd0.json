The Pueblo County Coroner's office says he died from a single gunshot wound to the head.\nPolice were called to a home in the 2100 block of E. 14th Street Monday night just before midnight. Witnesses told police the teen had been playing Russian roulette when he shot himself.\nWhen officers arrived Leiba was still breathing but he later died at the hospital.\n\"This game is absolutely dangerous. It will kill you. And we do not want any kids playing this game, or adults,\" said Capt. Kenny Rider.\nPolice said several other teens were at the home when the incident happened but the victim was the only one playing Russian roulette.\n\"Everybody verified or confirmed that this juvenile who died had been playing that game, had spun the cylinder and pulled the trigger at least four times before it actually fired,\" Rider said.\nRussian roulette is played by putting a single bullet in the cylinder of a gun, spinning the cylinder then putting the gun to one's head and pulling the trigger.\nRider said fatalities involving Russian roulette are not common in Pueblo but said, \"We don't want this to become a trend, either.\"\nPolice haven't recovered the gun used in the shooting."}
