Lake Mead Blvd., the Metropolitan Police Department said. The Clark County coroner\u2019s office said Stockard died of a gunshot wound to the chest; his death was ruled a homicide.\nThe Clark County district attorney\u2019s office will work with Metro homicide detectives to determine whether any charges will be filed. No one is in custody.\nDickerson, 19, had been in the car\u2019s front seat, Stockard in the back with another person. The driver, Dickerson said, was outside the vehicle with a gun. Dickerson named neither the other backseat passenger nor the driver.\nDickerson said there was an argument about whether the driver\u2019s gun was loaded; though the gun had no magazine, Dickerson said there was a single round in the chamber.\nDickerson said when the driver pulled the trigger, a bullet struck Stockard.\n\u201cI basically watched my friend die,\u201d Dickerson said.\nDickerson said he tried and failed to treat his friend\u2019s wounds in the car. So he laid him on the ground to try again.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cHe was a good young man with a golden heart.\u201d\nDickerson said his mother had taken Stockard into their home several months ago. Dickerson said he and Stockard were considering their futures and contemplating joining the military.\nWhen Stockard was being loaded into an ambulance bound for University Medical Center, Dickerson he wanted to ride along, but stayed at the scene as a witness to police.\nDickerson said he learned of Stockard\u2019s death about 11 p.m. that night, then broke down.\n\u201cIt plays in my mind over and over again every night,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\nNyree Puente, a 17-year-old who knew Stockard, said he was \u201ca good friend.\u201d\n\u201cHe was goofy. He would love to sing, but he couldn\u2019t sing,\u201d Puente said, laughing. \u201cHe always had a positive energy around him.\u201d\nKimbryanna Smith, Puente\u2019s 17-year-old sister, said she was stunned to hear Stockard had been killed.\n\u201cIt was actually shocking,\u201d Smith said.\nSmith said Stockard liked to stay in and play video games; Dickerson said the two had played together many times.\n\u201cHe likes to laugh, he likes to make other people laugh,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe\u2019s really the joker.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be OK,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI know he\u2019s in a better place.\u201d\nDickerson said he\u2019ll never forget the friend he lost.\n\u201cHis memory will live on in us and everyone else whose life he filled with joy.\u201d\nReview-Journal reporter Max Michor contributed to this story.
