One person died and four were critically injured outside an unidentified establishment, said Detroit Deputy Police Chief Renee Hall. It is a well-known crime area, she said.\nPolice didn\u2019t have any details about the shooting, but said children at the establishment witnessed the shootings.\n\u201cTonight, we are looking at a tragic situation throughout the east side of Detroit,\u201d Hall said. \u201cEight people are shot and two are dead.\n\u201cIt was a 74-degree day. The sun was out, and right now we have people all across the city firing shots at each other.\u201d\nIn another incident, an unidentified man was ambushed by three African-American men near Packard and Savage, police said. Two men in the back of a dark-colored Dodge Stratus got out and fired several shots at a man, killing him, Hall said.\nIn the other shooting around 7:40 p.m., someone tried to rob a man outside of a home on the 2000 block of Mead St. The man\u2019s brother came out of the house with a weapon and 10-15 shots were exchanged, Hall said.\nThe suspect and the armed brother were injured, she said. Police recovered two weapons outside the home and one inside of it.\nThe nighttime shootings followed a noontime shooting of a 28-year-old man in his car along Interstate 94 near the Lodge Freeway in Detroit. The man who was hit in the head, midsection and leg was critically injured, police said, adding that the incident followed a prior dispute.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to summer,\u201d Hall said, \u201cbut we\u2019re not certain our citizens are looking forward to it with all of the crime going on right now.\u201d\ncferretti@detroitnews.com"}
