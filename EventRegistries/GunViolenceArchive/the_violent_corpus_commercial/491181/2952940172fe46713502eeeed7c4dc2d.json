Witnesses said at least one man out of a group of four ran over to the family and started firing.\nThe shooting left 45-year-old Ronaldo Pizarro, his wife 37-year-old Melody Amill, his 22-year-old son, and two other relatives injured.\nThe five family members were shot in broad daylight before a number of witnesses.\n\u201cI heard the gunshots,\u201d said 46-year-old Ivet Hernandez.\nHernandez said she looked from her window to see a group of young men all wearing white T-shirts running from the scene after the shots were fired.\nSome friends of the family believed the shooting was in retribution for one of the victims reporting abuse inside a nearby McDonald\u2019s. They said one of the perpetrators threw a milkshake in the face of the victim\u2019s daughter.\nThe elder Pizarro had reportedly told police that his 18-year-old daughter was harassed by a group of young men while she was working at the restaurant. After she refused the advances of one of the young men, he grew angry and threw the drink in her face.\n\u201cThey were making advances and teasing her and harassing her,\u201d said family friend Ivette Miranda. \u201cIt got worse when they threw a milkshake in her face. She called her dad, Rolando, and he went there to the McDonald\u2019s and called the cops.\n\u201cHe filed a police report right there. Those guys are bad men. They wanted to get back at Rolando for filing a report.\u201d\nAll five of the family members shot after the McDonald\u2019s incident in Brooklyn were taken to hospitals and expected to survive."}
