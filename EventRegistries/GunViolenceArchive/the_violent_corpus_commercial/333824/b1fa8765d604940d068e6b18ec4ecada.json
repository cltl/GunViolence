We found a male who was shot in the foot, the ankle area, at close range. He was shot one time. We found the wadding from the shell casing in his shoe. Right now it looks like it was self-inflicted.\u201d\nThe youth was transported to Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia in critical condition for emergency surgery.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Chitwood, police reported the youth was in the company of two boys who ran off when the sawed-off shotgun was fired.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who they are but would like to talk to them,\u201d Chitwood said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to talk the boy yet. He\u2019s still unconscious. He almost blew off his foot.\u201d\nPolice found the stock of the gun next to the boy\u2019s body.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t find the barrel of the gun,\u201d Chitwood said. \u201cMy question is, what was a 16-year-old boy from Chester doing in Upper Darby at 10:30 at night with a sawed-off shotgun? Why? Add that all up and it\u2019s not good. We\u2019re still investigating.\u201d\nAnyone with information should call police at 610-734-7677."}
