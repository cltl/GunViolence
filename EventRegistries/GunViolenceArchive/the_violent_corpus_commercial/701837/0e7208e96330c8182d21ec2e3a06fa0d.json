McCausland would not say whether it was an accidental shooting because the case remains under investigation.\nState police detectives arrested 30-year-old Ryan Gilliken of Hollis, Richardson\u2019s boyfriend, on Wednesday. He has been charged with domestic violence assault and a second count of assault on Weldon.\nMcCausland said the altercation took place at a home on River Road in Hollis, also known as Route 35, around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. Gilliken shares the home with Richardson and her three young children, who were home when the assault took place, according to state police. Weldon rents an apartment on the property.\nRichardson was transported to Maine Medical Center in Portland where she underwent surgery. She is expected to recover. Her condition was not available Wednesday evening.\nArrangements have been made for relatives to care for the children.\nGilliken was being held Wednesday evening at the York County Jail in Alfred. Domestic violence assault is a Class C felony. Gilliken has been denied bail pending his initial court appearance."}
