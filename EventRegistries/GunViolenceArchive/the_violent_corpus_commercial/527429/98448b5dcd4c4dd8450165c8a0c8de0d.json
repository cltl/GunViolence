Officials said the child is expected to recover.\nOne witness said a school bus had just pulled up when the shooting started.\n\u201cAnd then next thing I know, it's just \u2018pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,\u2019 and I saw this little boy just dive on the ground,\u201d the witness said.\nThe witness, who does not want to be identified, works at a nursing home just steps from the City View Apartment Complex where shots rang out sometime after 4 p.m.\nShe said she and some of the residents were in the activities room when they heard something unsettling.\n\u201cWe were looking at something on the TV and all of a sudden I heard like \u2018pop, pop, pop\u2019 and then one of the residents said, it sounds like gunfire,\u201d the witness said.\nCome to find out, it was gunfire.\nNeighbors claim to have heard more than 20 shots.\n\u201cI mean, who would just open fire with kids getting off the school bus? I mean, people just don't have respect or morals about anything anymore,\u201d the witness said.\nMany in the area were glad to learn that the child was not seriously hurt, and likely only grazed by a bullet.\nStill, as investigators work to figure out what happened, some residents shared their outrage, although they wished to remain anonymous.\n\u201cIt's very frustrating because you don't know if you can even come out at night. Because you don't know who they looking for or who they going to shoot,\u201d a neighbor said.\nOne man was the most upset that an innocent child got caught up in someone else's problems.\n\u201cThis is senseless. The shooting needs to stop,\u201d he said.\nPolice said the child was driven to the hospital in a private vehicle.\nAs far as we know, the 5-year-old was the only one hurt as a result of the shooting.\nAt this time, police do not have any suspects in the case.\nHowever, neighbors said they saw a large group of people standing outside just before the shooting."}
