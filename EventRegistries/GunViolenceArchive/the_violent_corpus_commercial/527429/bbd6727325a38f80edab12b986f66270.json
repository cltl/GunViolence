(WDRB) -- The mother of a little boy grazed by a bullet while riding his bike wants to know who shot her only child.\nToday, the boy's mother spoke out with community activist Christopher 2X. She wishes to remain anonymous.\nShe says she was watching her son Bobby riding his bike on S. 10th Street near West Chestnut Street Wednesday night, when she heard several gunshots.\nShe says she didn't know something was wrong until he started complaining that his back was burning. She then saw the injury and immediately took Bobby to the hospital.\n\"I was panicking, crying at the same time,\" she said. \"I was terrified, really.\"\n\"I just think it's crazy,\" she added. \"It shouldn't have happened that way. And I know they seen my son riding his bike. I mean, whoever it was, I hope they find whoever it was.\"\nChristopher 2X says there were several other children playing nearby at the Chestnut Street YMCA. He's thankful no one else got hurt.\nIf you have any information on the incident, call LMPD at 574-LMPD.\nCopyright 2016 by WDRB News. All rights reserved."}
