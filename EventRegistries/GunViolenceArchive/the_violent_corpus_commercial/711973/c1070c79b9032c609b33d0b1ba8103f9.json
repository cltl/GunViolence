Deputies say five hunters were hunting in a group when she was shot in the abdomen by 50-year-old John Lander of Rochester. The shooting took place in the area of River Road in Caledonia, about a half-mile away from a private driveway.\nA supervisor at the regional office in Avon told us that, despite recent cases, hunting-related deaths are actually down from where they used to be.\n\"If you look at the statistics of the state, they've been on decline since the 60s and 70s, and I think 2014 was the safest on record in New York State,\" says Lt. Joshua Verhague of the DEC.\nLt. Verhague says that's because hunters receive more safety training -- whether through a class or a step-by-step guide to using your firearm.\n\"The Ten Commandments of Firearm Safety -- we can't stress enough for hunters, as well as non-hunters, when carrying a firearm,\" he says, \"the safety aspect of it.\"\nLieutenant Verhague would not comment specifically about the case in Caledonia, but did say most hunting-related deaths are avoidable.\n\"Make sure you know your target and your target environment,\" says Lt. Verhague. \"Keep your finger outside the trigger guard and off the trigger at all times until you're on target and have made the conscious decision to fire.\"\nInvestigators say alcohol does not appear to have been a factor. At this point, no charges have been filed."}
