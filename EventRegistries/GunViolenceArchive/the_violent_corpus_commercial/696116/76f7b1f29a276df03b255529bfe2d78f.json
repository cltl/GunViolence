Andy Poteat.\nPoteat said Smith\u2019s boyfriend, Jason Rashon Tenor, 21, was handling a handgun left by a friend at a home in the 100 block of Tree Line Drive. The magazine was taken out of the gun, Poteat said, but the firearm was still loaded.\nPoteat said Tenor pulled the trigger intentionally, not thinking the gun would fire, and a bullet struck Smith.\nTenor, of Wedgewood Road, Statesville, has been charged with felony involuntary manslaughter.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no indication that he intended to kill anyone or intended to hurt anyone,\u201d Poteat said, adding that witnesses reported hearing the couple laughing together before the shot was fired.\nTenor called 911 after the shooting and was cooperative with law enforcement, Poteat said. Forensic analysis on the path of the bullet and how it was fired agreed with Tenor\u2019s story, he added.\nDuring investigation, deputies discovered marijuana and drug paraphernalia on Tenor\u2019s possession, Poteat said. Tenor was charged with possession of both, but Poteat said marijuana consumption is not believed to be a factor in Smith\u2019s death.\n\u2018SHE HAD A GOOD HEART\u2019\n\u201cShe was so down to earth,\u201d said one of Smith\u2019s friends, Dominique Painter. \u201cYou could call her, she would be there for you. She had a good heart.\u201d\n\u201cAt first I was in shock. I felt numb.\u201d Painter said. \u201cI felt like I lost a part of me. ... I\u2019ll miss almost everything. I\u2019ll just miss being able to pick up the phone and call her.\u201d\nAnother friend, Katie Underwood, said she grew close to Smith after she tried out for the cheerleading team her freshman year. Underwood was already a cheerleader.\n\u201cI was speechless,\u201d Underwood said about reading on Facebook that Smith had died. \u201cI was kind of hoping it was just a dream.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, whatever, people are just messing around. Cortney can\u2019t be gone,\u201d Beth Underwood said of her initial thoughts upon hearing the news.\n\u201cWe (had) just seen her about a month ago out at West Middle School and she came running up to me and gave me a hug,\u201d Beth Underwood said. \u201cI mean, I can just still see her smile while running across the parking lot to give me a hug.\u201d\nBeth Underwood said their families were close, and that Smith often called her \u201cmom.\u201d\nThe Underwoods had difficulty keeping back tears while talking about the loss.\nDEPUTY STRESSES GUN SAFETY"}
