Video of suspects coming soon.\n\u2014 Mark D. Levine (@MarkLevineNYC) February 2, 2015\nThe councilman said that police have identified the suspects, who have extensive criminal records.\nBut Graham's mother, Yvonne Graham, 51, disputed her son's gang membership.\n\"He is not in a gang. They aren't in a gang. They're too old to be in a gang. He hasn't ever been in a gang,\" the grieving mother said.\n\"I wish they'd stop saying that,\" she added.\nGraham and his friends were coming from the bar when they stopped to flirt with three women standing in front of the Crown Fried Chicken near the shooting scene, a source said.\nGraham and the group, none of whose names were released, walked south and made it to a deli at 3345 Broadway when the two men came up from behind and opened fire, police said.\n\"I heard like five, 'Bang, bam, bam, bam.' There were some customers in front. They started screaming, 'Oh my God! Oh my God!' and I came up to the front,\" said deli worker Francisco Basquis, 33.\n\"I saw a man on the sidewalk. There was blood coming out of his head,\" Basquis said.\nGraham, of Central Harlem, was shot in the head and pronounced dead at the scene, NYPD officials said.\nA 24-year-old man was hit in the right arm and ankle and was treated at Harlem Hospital along with a 22-year-old man who was hit in the torso and leg, police said.\nThe women they were with, two 21-year-olds, were both hit in the shoulder and treated at St. Luke's Hospital, police said.\nThey were all listed in stable condition, officials said.\n\"It was certainly a targeted shooting. they were looking for these guys.\" Levine, who spoke to the precinct commander, said. \"The two women were innocent bystanders, caught in the cross fire.\"\nThe two shooters hopped into a nearby cab and fled the scene, police said.\nThey had not been arrested as of Monday morning, police said.\n\"The polices are treating it as like a vendetta shooting,\" the councilman said.\nGraham's family and friends gathered at his home in Harlem to console his grieving mother.\n\"Everybody's crying and weeping and sharing stories,\" Yvonne Graham said.\nNow, she has to take on the difficult task of burying her son, made harder without adequate financing.\n\"I don\u2019t have money right now. I don\u2019t have insurance,\" the 51-year-old said.\nHer son, who's survived by his own 7-year-old boy, two brothers and two sisters, liked to have a good time with friends and relax at home, she said.\n\"He was a fun-loving, caring father,\" his distraught mother said."}
