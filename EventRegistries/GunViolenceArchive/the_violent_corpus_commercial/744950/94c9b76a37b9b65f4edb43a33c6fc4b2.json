At that moment I realised that the mouth guard had shattered again, and I was alive.\"\nAfter being checked over by doctors, Blaine discovered that he had a lacerated throat - and his friends have refused to assist with the death-defying stunt ever again.\nBut, shockingly, Blaine still plans to do the trick in his upcoming world tour.\nViewers took to Twitter to express their shock last night.\nAmong them was Ashley Harrison, who said: \"David Blaine? More like David Insane!\n\"He plans on doing the bullet catch trick in his world tour. How can he be so sure it won't kill him?\"\nWhile Meg labelled him an 'absolute mad b******' and Antoine called him a 'crazy dawg'.\nAnd Tom Vasiljevic added: \"David Blaine ain't human, what person would attempt to catch a bullet in their mouth? Or regurgitate frogs?\""}
