No one was in custody Saturday evening.\nFamily identified the victim as Naome Zuber, a senior at Curie High School, who hoped to study criminal justice in college.\nZuber was in a vehicle headed to a birthday party with three other friends when she was shot. The shooter fired shots from the sidewalk and one of the bullets struck Zuber in her head, police said.\nTwo men and another girl who were traveling in the vehicle with Zuber were not injured.\nShe was transported in critical condition to Holy Cross Hospital where she later died.\nZuber worked at a concession stand at U.S. Cellular Field. She had finished work earlier in the evening.\nTatyanna Rivera, Zuber's friend, said they had planned to go to college next year in Texas where they would be roommates.\n\"I don't believe my best friend is gone. It just doesn't feel real,\" Rivera said. \"She didn't deserve this. She's 17. We just started our senior year. We had so much going for us and somebody just took it away from her.\"\n\"These streets are not safe. And she's just gone,\" said Elizabeth Estrada, a friend of Zuber."}
