But, there\u2019s more than weather at play here. Some parents say there\u2019s worry as well.\n\u201cThis is not good,\u201d said Devetta Jackson. Jackson and her children live just down the street from the park and were troubled when police and paramedics blocked the street Sunday evening. So she went to ask why. \u201cThe police was telling us that a child had got hit in a drive by!\u201d\nPolice confirmed a 9-year-old was riding in a vehicle that was sprayed with bullets and taken to Dallas Children\u2019s Medical Center in good condition.\n\u201cThey were shooting from the park,\u201d said Jackson\u2019s 10-year-old K\u2019Sean. He and friends were playing outside when gunfire shattered the Sunday evening calm. \u201cIt sound like a machine gun going back and forth: boom-boom-boom-boom,\u201d while also adding that the gunfire sounded like more than one weapon was involved, as though \u201cpeople shooting back at each other.\u201d\nSandra Lover, who lives nearby, says she thought the commotion was an auto accident. She\u2019s been a park neighbor for some 30 years and says increased police presence and better lighting have made the park a community asset that most view as safe.\n\u201cEvery weekend it\u2019s crowded with people having picnics, birthday parties, just enjoying the area,\u201d said Lover, who adds that she even takes her walks there. Now, she wants answers about what led to a drive by shooting that left a child injured. Who opened fire and why? She\u2019s relieved the child will recover; but, can\u2019t help but hope that the trouble was just passing through.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just terrible,\u201d said Lover. \u201cYou can\u2019t even let your kids come to a safe place like a park and enjoy the day. It\u2019s senseless.\u201d\n\u201cA bullet does not have an eye and this is broad daylight,\u201d said Jackson, while repeating a call for answers from police. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nDallas Police provided no additional information on the investigation or search for suspects on Monday.\n(\u00a92016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
