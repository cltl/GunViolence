Deceased is Robert T. Edwards, 41, of the same address. His wife, Jamie Renee Edwards, 48, suffered a gunshot wound where the bullet passed through her upper right arm, according to the incident report filed by Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Shawn O\u2019Kelley, first law officer to arrive at the scene.\nSummarizing the incident two days later, Chief Deputy Christopher Bish said, \u201cA husband and wife were involved in a dispute. It got out of hand. The husband was shot. He was taken to the hospital and died there. The preliminary investigation looks like it was self-inflicted, but we are still piecing all that together. We still have a number of people to interview. What we\u2019re trying to do is determine what happened, where we can clarify if it was intentional or accidental.\u201d\nOn Deputy O\u2019Kelley\u2019s arrival to the house in response to the 911 call that reported the shooting, a family member led him to a bedroom, where Robert Edwards lay at the foot of a bed. In a state of hysteria, Jamie Edwards, Robert\u2019s wife, leaned over her husband as another household member held a cloth comforter around Robert Edwards\u2019 head, O\u2019Kelley reported. The deputy recorded he saw a gunshot wound at Edwards\u2019 right temple and a knot at the left temple. Edwards struggled to breathe, O\u2019Kelley observed. The deputythen also saw what appeared to be a gunshot wound completely through Mrs. Edwards\u2019 arm, he wrote."}
