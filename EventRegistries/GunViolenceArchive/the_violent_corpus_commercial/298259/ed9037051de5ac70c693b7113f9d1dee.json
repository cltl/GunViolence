I think it's horrible when any child gets shot,\" neighbor Kristine Longwood said.\nLongwood heard the medical chopper landing to rush the little boy to the hospital in critical condition. LifeFlight took the child to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where he died hours later.\n\"There are no words to describe a child being hurt in this manner,\" said Sonora Storm, who lives in the neighborhood. \"Prayers to the family and friends.\"\nInvestigators said the boy's mother was home with her two sons when the shooting happened. They said it appears that it was a tragic accident.\nNeighbors said the boy's family had recently moved in. Friday night people placed stuffed animals and candles in front of their house.\nOnce an investigation is complete, a grand jury will most likely decide if the boy's parents will face any charges.\nCopyright 2015 by Click2Houston.com.
