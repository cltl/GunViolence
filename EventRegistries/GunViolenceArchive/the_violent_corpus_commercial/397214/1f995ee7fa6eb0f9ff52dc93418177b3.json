Gregg Rector said an adult family members called 911 upon returning home from work, and reported it as an accidental shooting.\nParamedics arrived on the scene and pronounced the 31-year-old man dead. He had been shot once in the head.\n\"It was reported to us that he was accidentally shot by a toddler, but we haven't verified that,'' Rector said earlier today. \"It's too early to tell if that indeed is going to be the case.\"\nRector said this evening that detectives and crime scene technicians have examined the scene, collected evidence and interviewed several individuals. Preliminary information provided to officers indicated that the victim's 2-year-old son may have accidentally shot his father.\nThe toddler and his father were possibly the only two people home when the incident occurred. \"Other possible scenarios are being investigated but at this time there does not appear to be an intruder or any third person involved,\" Rector said. \"However, this investigation is still in its very early stages and detectives are not completely ruling out other possibilities.\"\nRector said additional information may be available as early as Wednesday, after detectives have more thoroughly examined evidence and after the autopsy is completed. The victim's identity will also be released on Wednesday, he said."}
