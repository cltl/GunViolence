Mainly this was representing our ancestors that fought so hard for us,\u201d said Mandy Jones, owner of Nicey\u2019s Restaurant & The Rock Christian Center & Book Store.\nJones\u2019 businesses are both at the intersection where the bullets rang out. Inside what appears to be a bookstore is also a church.\nJones\u2019 husband works as a pastor here and tries to reach out to youth in this community talking about the trouble he got into during his teen years.\n\u201cNowadays, our children fear nothing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey have no respect, they have no fear. They don\u2019t even fear the law.\u201d\nAnother example of that, she believes, is the gang-related shooting at this very same intersection just two days into the new year.\nNew HPD chief Art Acevedo made his presence visible to this South Park community during that investigation.\n\u201cWe want the community\u2026 this particular community to know that you are important to HPD, and we\u2019re going to be with you guys,\u201d said Troy Fenner, South Patrol Asst. Chief with HPD.\nAfter the shooting, on the day set to honor the civil rights leader who preached that \u201creturning violence for violence multiplies violence,\u201d neighbors believe the message isn\u2019t getting through to the younger generation, and they\u2019re hoping authorities can help.\n\u201cI ask all the city officials to come out. Come and observe what\u2019s going on in the community. You have to mix and mingle with the people,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThen and only then you will understand what\u2019s going on in the community.\u201d\nPolice still have not released a motive or any suspect information in Monday night\u2019s gunfire. Anyone with information regarding the shooting is asked to call 713-521-4600.\nAmong the shootings at MLK celebrations across the country, in Miami, eight people were wounded and in Chicago, 39 people were shot across the city over the holiday weekend, leaving at least 10 dead.\n(\u00a9 2017 KHOU)"}
