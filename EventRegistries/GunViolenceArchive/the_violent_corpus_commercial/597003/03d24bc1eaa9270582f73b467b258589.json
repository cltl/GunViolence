Bullet holes were visible on the exterior of the residence.\nFamily members took the boy to Saint Bernard Hospital, which immediately transferred him to Comer Children\u2019s Hospital. He was listed in serious condition.\nSome witnesses said the boy was playing on the sidewalk when he was shot; others said he was on the family\u2019s porch.\nRegardless, Englewood Political Task Force President Darryl Smith said it\u2019s intolerable.\nSmith said something must change, but not necessarily gun laws.\n\u201cYou can take all the guns away you want. You can take this gun, I\u2019m going to go find another one. You can take this gun, I\u2019m going to go find another one. It\u2019s the person, it\u2019s not the gun. It\u2019s the person that has the gun, that pulls the trigger, that sees a child on the porch, and shoots up there anyway; that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Smith said.\nHe said police must sit with the shooters.\n\u201cWhen they come in these rooms, they don\u2019t go get Joe Schmoe, they don\u2019t go get Ms. Johnson, Ms. Smith, Ms. Jones. They go get who they want to go get, and bring them in the room, and they just talk about the same thing they\u2019ve been talking about for the last 20 years, and nothing\u2019s been resolved. Go to the grassroots, and get the people who know \u2026 what\u2019s going on in the streets,\u201d he said.\nThe boy shot in Englewood is at least the fourth child under the age of 8 to be shot on the South Side in the last eight days.\nOn Monday, two cousins, ages 5 and 8, were also shot in Englewood.\nOn June 28, 4-year-old Kevan Collins was shot in the face while walking with his family and a friend, after leaving a nearby park so his mother could change his baby brother\u2019s diaper. A bullet grazed Kevan\u2019s face. He was taken to Comer Children\u2019s Hospital, where he was listed in serious but stable condition the day after the shooting."}
