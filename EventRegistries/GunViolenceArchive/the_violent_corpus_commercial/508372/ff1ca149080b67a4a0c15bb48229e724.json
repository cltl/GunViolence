Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th) and the Englewood Police District CAPS organized the rally, which was held in the 5600 block of South Wolcott Avenue.\nThe Rev. Dwayne Grant of Xperience Church Chicago, who's also a community activist, arrived early to distribute fliers and knock on doors. He said the rally was in response to Saturday\u2019s shooting that wounded 3-year-old Ayden Deer.\nEnglewood District Cmdr. Larry Watson called the shooting a \u201ctragedy\u201d and said that for there to be an \u201ceffective\u201d change, the community must take action.\n\u201cThis is a problem we can fix,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will operate in a community where they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d he said referring to the shooters. \u201cThey do it because they know no one will say anything.\u201d\nAyden\u2019s uncle Kelvin Conley attended the event and said he\u2019s not certain that what the police are trying to do will be effective, but it\u2019s worth a try.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d he said.\nWhat happened to his nephew was a surprise, Conley said, because the block is usually safe.\n\u201cThis the first time something happened like this in like a year and a half,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes on around here, just not this block. This block is nice.\u201d\nThe older men on the block keep it safe by telling anyone who looks like trouble to leave, he said.\nConley said he gets respect on the block and that he\u2019s willing to work with the community and police to help prevent what happened to Ayden from happening to anyone else.\nCelisa Gardner has lived in the community for 36 years. She came out of her home in the 5700 block of South Winchester Street when she saw the police lights. The solution to her is to provide more places for neighborhood children to go.\n\u201cIf they have somewhere to go, they won\u2019t be on the street,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say the village can raise a child, no, the village is sick. We can\u2019t raise the child anymore.\u201d\nGlen Brooks, Area South coordinator for the Chicago Police, said there will be a father-daughter dance in May. Lopez is also working on getting a community soccer team started. There\u2019s also the Englewood Police Youth Baseball League. Brooks encouraged people to sign the list that Sgt. Kimberly D. Woods passed around.\n\u201cThe first step is to organize ... none of us can do this alone,\u201d Brooks said.\nLopez came out to take a stand against the violence too.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of all the shootings in our neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cOur kids need the opportunity to become adults, and until all our neighborhoods start standing up and fighting back, that\u2019s not going to happen. Our children are not targets for gangbangers who don't know how to shoot.\u201d\nWhen he addressed the gathering of about two dozen he asked them \u201cWhose neighborhood is this?\u201d They shouted back \u201cOurs.\u201d\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:"}
