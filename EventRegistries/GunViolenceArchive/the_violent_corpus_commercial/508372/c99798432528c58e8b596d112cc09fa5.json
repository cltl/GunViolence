Relatives identified the victim as 3-year-old Ayden Deer.\nRelatives drove Ayden to Comer Children's Hospital, where he is in good condition. He is expected to survive.\nOn Saturday afternoon, investigators found at least eight bullet casings at the scene in the 5600-block of S. Wolcott in the West Englewood neighborhood.\nOne of those shots hit 3-year-old Ayden in the leg. Witnesses said had been playing outside and had just gotten off his bike.\n\"It shouldn't happen like that, it's sad. For whoever did it, shame on them because you never know. It could be your child too,\" said Kellis Jones, a neighbor.\nNeighbors said several suspected gang members fired shots, but it is unclear who they were targeting as there were several people on the street at the time. Police said the boy was an unintended victim.\nWitnesses said the suspects ran away from the scene between houses to the alley, leaving the boy lying in the street.\nActivist Andrew Holmes said this is another example of the failure of gun control in Chicago.\n\"Put the gun down. You send this child through suffering and all this pain. The child just wanted to play, the weather has just started to change. Now, how do you think this child is going to grow up as a child, scared to come out on the street at 3 years old,\" Holmes said.\nPolice continue to search for the suspects. Investigators said it's possible that the gunmen may have been targeting one of the boy's relatives."}
