Smith and Wadley allegedly had weapons with them when police apprehended the trio on Louise Lane following the fatal shooting. Another gun was found on the ground on Louise Lane, and police later charged George with weapons offenses for allegedly tossing it before his apprehension.\nWimbush-Jalaah was shot around 3:45 p.m. that Saturday in Prospect Village, which is a Trenton Housing Authority complex. He later died at the hospital.\nAt this time, police have not disclosed a suspected motive for the killing, but detectives who spoke on condition of anonymity said street hustlers from Prospect Village have been \u201cbeefing\u201d with hustlers from the North 25 Housing complex for a while. The apartment complexes are less than a 15-minute walk from each other, and pedestrians would more than likely cross Calhoun Street, which intersects with Louise Lane, if they were to walk from one complex to the other.\nGeorge has been incarcerated since June. Smith and Wadley were arrested again Wednesday morning in Trenton by members of the U.S. Marshals NY/NJ Regional Fugitive Task Force.\nBail for each teen was set at $1 million cash or bond."}
