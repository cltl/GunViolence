They also spoke to Eyewitness News outside the court afterward.\nGarcia's mother, Victoria Gonzalez, said it was emotional seeing Romero.\n\"He didn't face the crowd,\" she said. \"To me, he's a coward. He was a coward when he did it. He ran for two years. He didn't face anybody. That just goes to show what type of person he is.\"\nAfter two years on the run, Romero was arrested Friday in Mexico and extradited to Bakersfield for his court appearance Tuesday.\nHis bail was denied."}
