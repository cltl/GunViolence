Prosecutors need to decide whether he\u2019ll be charged and tried as an adult, according to the judge.\nWhen the hearing was over, the teen\u2019s attorney said he did not intend to cause any harm.\nThe Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office said the teen lives at the home in Cooper City where the shooting happened.\nAccording to a police report, the two 14-year-old boys and the victim\u2019s 16-year-old brother were playing with the gun in the garage of the home when it went off.\nNobody else was home at the time.\nThe report states the boys found the teen\u2019s handgun in a gun box that was inside a cardboard box. When they found the gun, the alleged shooter said he took the gun out and noticed the gun had a magazine in the wall of the gun. A second magazine was also in the gun box, the teen told police, which was loaded with ammunition. The teen said he took the first magazine out of the gun and saw it was unloaded. He then told police that he pulled the slide back on the gun and saw that it didn\u2019t have a round in the chamber.\nThe teen told police he pulled the trigger several times and that the victim\u2019s older brother took the gun from him and also pulled the trigger several times. The alleged shooter said the victim also played with the gun and pulled the trigger. The defendant told police that when he took the gun back from the victim, he pulled the trigger and the gun went off.\nThe victim was shot in the head.\nHe told police he had \u201cno idea how a live round got into firearm.\u201d\nAfter police obtained the gun, according to the report, they determined the magazine was loaded with 14 rounds and the gun had one live round in the chamber. The empty magazine was found on the ground of the garage.\n\u201cIt\u2019s with a real heavy heart that we have this tragedy that youngster lost his life,\u201d said Sheriff Scott Israel said Thursday. \u201cOur deputies arrived at the scene and we come in contact with three juveniles. One of whom was tragically deceased. It looks like he died of a gunshot wound,\u201d Sheriff Israel said.\nHomicide detectives scoured through the home on NW 41 St. near Palm Ave. and Stirling Rd. Thursday and interviewed the boys for hours before arresting the 14-year-old and charging him with manslaughter.\nThe homeowner told CBS4 his family is going through a hard time and did not want to talk about what happened.\nPeople who live nearby are torn up by the tragedy.\n\u201cFor something to happen to a child is absolutely devastating. I feel for the parents, I feel for the community because this isn\u2019t that type of place,\u201d Karen Kriger said.\nBSO, coincidentally, has been planning to have a firearms safety class next Tuesday in Cooper City. The class will focus on safety lessons for children ages 11 to 14. It will discuss topics like properly securing firearms and the dangers of guns.\nThe victim\u2019s family set up a page to help raise money for funeral costs as well as money for the family to help deal with the tragedy.
