He was arrested Tuesday at a motel in the 200 block of Bammel-Westfield Rd, about 8 miles north of the murder scene.

Three men got out of a dark sedan and tried to snatch Gomez's purse, investigators said.\nOfficials said Gomez would not let go of the purse, and one of the men started shooting. Gomez and her children were shot several times, deputies said.\nNeighbor Jessica Zapata pulled into the parking lot the same time as police. She says she saw Gomez and her 4-year-old daughter unconscious on the ground. Gomez\u2019 ten year old daughter was calling family members on her cell phone. But she was also hit.\nPHOTOS: Diana Gomez, Ava Castillo, Betsida Castillo\n\u201cThe 10-year-old started limping, and that\u2019s when everyone started screaming, \u2018she\u2019s shot, she\u2019s shot,\u2019 and that\u2019s when the cops looked at her and she had a wound right here at the stomach.\u201d Zapata said. \u201cWe got shot, we got shot, that\u2019s all she said.\u201d\nThe three victims were taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital, where Ava died.\nAs of Tuesday night, Gomez remained in critical condition. Her sister, Julie, says she had about seven gunshot wounds and will probably remain in the hospital for at least another week. Betsida was released from the hospital on Tuesday and should be OK.\n\u201cIt has been tough,\u201d Julie said. \u201cWhy would you rob someone with small children?\u201d\nJulie said she had to break the news to her sister on Tuesday that 4-year-old Ava did not survive.\n\u201cShe has a breathing tube so she couldn\u2019t speak. She just cried,\u201d Julie said.\nOn Tuesday night, community members came to drop off flowers and balloons at a growing memorial, near the scene of the shooting.\n\u201cWe're all a community so we need to come together as a community and stop this nonsense,\u201d said Michael Aguilar, who lives near the apartment complex.\nA GoFundMe account has been set up for the family.\n.@HCSOTexas arrest POI in shooting of mother & 2 kids.
