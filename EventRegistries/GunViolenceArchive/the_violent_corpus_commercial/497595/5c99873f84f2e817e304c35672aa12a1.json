A troopers helicopter swooped low over adjacent properties but also circled directly over the property. A Matanuska-Susitna Borough Animal Care and Regulation truck pulled into the driveway around mid-morning. An officer with Animal Care and Regulation took a dog into protective custody at troopers' request, according to a statement from borough spokeswoman Patty Sullivan. The dog was later released to an authorized person.\nMat-Su emergency crews were initially called to the home and asked to stage at a nearby fire station at Pittman Road, even at one point instructed to go inside the station rather than sit in their vehicles due to the possibility of a suspect at large. They were released after troopers discovered the victims were deceased.\nOne resident who pulled into the subdivision after being gone all morning was escorted inside by several troopers, who checked to make sure the empty home was secure.\nBy noon, however, troopers investigators left the property and much of the police presence disappeared, including the helicopter."}
