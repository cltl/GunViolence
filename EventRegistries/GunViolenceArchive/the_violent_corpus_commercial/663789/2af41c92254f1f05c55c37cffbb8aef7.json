Sheriff's officials said there have been past shootings in the general area but not at the location where the children were wounded.\nDeputies are trying to locate shell casings so they can determine what weapon was used in the shooting.\nThe darkness and a Monday rainstorm that pounded the neighborhood made the task of gathering evidence difficult, officials said.\nThe search is expected to resume at first light, officials said.\nThe identities of the wounded children have not been released.\nDavid Taylor contributed to this report."}
