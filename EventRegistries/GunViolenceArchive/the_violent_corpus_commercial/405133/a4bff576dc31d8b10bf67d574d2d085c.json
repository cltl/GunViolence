Try to get all these people identified and prosecuted as needed, and move on to the next case,\" Smith said.\nSmith says his office has been working closely with Jacksonville PD, Longview PD and the Gregg County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\"You can have one-on-one with an investigator or detective, for instance, from Longview PD, but if we can't go get those records from Gregg County, we're at a stalemate,\" Smith said.\nSheriff Maxey Cerliano says since they run the jail, they keep information that could be vital in solving this case.\n\"You know, contact information, addresses, things such as that, that could be utilized to assist in locating suspects or persons of interest,\" Cerliano said.\nSmith says when you're outside your jurisdiction, if you don't know who you're working with, investigations are more challenging.\n\"It's almost next to impossible if you don't have a relationship,\" Smith said.\nBut Smith is hoping the relationships they've established will bring them one step closer to closing this case.\nSheriff Smith says that since their press conference Tuesday, three new witnesses have come forward.\nAnyone with information related to the shooting is urged to contact the sheriff's office at: 903-597-CUFF. Officials say informants can be anonymous."}
