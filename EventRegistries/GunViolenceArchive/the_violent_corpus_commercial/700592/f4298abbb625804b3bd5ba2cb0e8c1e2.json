Witnesses later told investigators Broadbent appeared nervous, jittery and was sweating.\n\"He appeared to be under the influence of something and was acting very suspicious. The female victim was sitting next to Jarrat and could see that he had something in his coat. She asked what it is was, he pulled out a handgun, and dropped it on the floor. When he went to pick it up, it went off. The bullet went into and through his leg and through the victim's leg and lodged into her other leg,\" Martinez said.\nBroadbent then pointed the revolver at the driver's head and told him to take them to the hospital, according to Martinez. When they got there, he ordered everyone to get out of the car, and then drove off, the lieutenant said.\nA 29-year-old woman from Nephi was treated for gunshot wounds to both her legs.
