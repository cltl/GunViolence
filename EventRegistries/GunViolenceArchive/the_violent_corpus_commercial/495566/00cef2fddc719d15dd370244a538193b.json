The shooting was reported 3:30 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 21 after a group of uninvited guests showed up to a house party in the 2300 block of West McMillan Road in Fruitland Township.\nPolice say Black-Wickliffe was one of those uninvited guests who refused to leave without a fight.\nOgreen played baseball and football at Reeths-Puffer High School where he graduated. He also played baseball at Muskegon Community College.\nOne person at the party, who is not suspected of being the shooter, is being held on other charges, Muskegon County Sheriff Dean Roesler said.\nOgreen died at the scene of the shooting.\nThree other men were injured in the shooting:\n\u2022 Cody James Sharlow, who was shot in the stomach and hip area, has been upgraded from critical to fair condition, Mercy Health Muskegon spokeswoman Joan Kessler said Monday morning.\n\u2022 Nicholas Aaron Gifford, shot in the right thigh, has been upgraded from serious to fair condition, Kessler said.\n\u2022 Medical staff as of Sunday had treated and released Julius Scott Pamer, who was shot in the buttocks.\nRoesler said that every indication so far in the investigation is that the shooting arose out of a confrontation between the uninvited guests and those already at the house party. The argument escalated to a physical confrontation. The indication so far is that one member of the uninvited group became upset and pulled out a handgun, Roesler said.\nAnyone with information about Black-Wickliffe's whereabouts is asked to call 911, Silent Observer at 72-CRIME or the sheriff's office at 231-724-6308 or 231-206-9476.\nHeather Lynn Peters covers police and fire, and writes a statewide food column, The Spunky Kitchen, for MLive/Muskegon Chronicle.
