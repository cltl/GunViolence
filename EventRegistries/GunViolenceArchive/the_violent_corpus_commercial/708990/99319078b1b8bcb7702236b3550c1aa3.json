Madison St.\n\u201cI just heard a loud bang. I just heard it and stayed inside with my baby,\u201d Alora Golden, who lives down the street, said.\nPolice believe the young victim, who was shot inside her home, was shot while by somebody driving by. There are several bullet holes through the front door of the home.\n\u201cI was like what is that? I heard it and I was going to check but I didn`t,\u201d Golden said.\nPolice say the child was shot in the back and rushed to the hospital where she is now recovering.\nArea residents say officers blocked off surrounding streets for hours as they investigated.\n\u201cThey were here for a long time,\u201d\nThe suspect is still on the loose.\nAnother neighbor, who wanted to remain anonymous, was rattled by the apparent random violence.\n\u201cThat was a major surprise. This is a very quiet area,\u201d the neighbor told Newschannel 4.\nFor Golden, a mother herself, it\u2019s not just unusual but also scary.\n\u201cJust to think if me and my baby were out here, it`s crazy,\u201d Golden said.\nAt last check, there was no word on the child's condition."}
