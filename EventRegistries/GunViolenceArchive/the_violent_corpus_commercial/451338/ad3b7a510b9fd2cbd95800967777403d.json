Witnesses reported hearing an argument nearby before shots were fired from a silver sedan that then sped west on Pike Street, police said.\nThree of the five people who were injured had been discharged from Harborview Medical Center by Monday morning and a fourth victim, who was listed in satisfactory condition, was expected to be discharged later in the day, said hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg.\nThe fifth person is in satisfactory condition.\nPlay VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:00Loaded: 0%Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:00Playback Rate1\nChapters\nChapters\ndescriptions off, selected\nDescriptions\nsubtitles off, selected\nSubtitles\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\ncaptions off, selected\nCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreen\nThis is a modal window.\nCaptions Settings Dialog Beginning of dialog window.

Patrick Michaud, a police spokesman.\nIt could take awhile to view all the footage to see if video-surveillance cameras in the area \u201ccaught anything before, during and after\u201d the incident to help detectives build a timeline for the shooting, he said.\nMichaud couldn\u2019t provide any additional information about where the argument may have started or what it was about but said those details will likely emerge as the investigation continues.\nHe encouraged any witnesses who may have video of the incident or those who haven\u2019t yet spoken to officers about what they saw to call the department\u2019s nonemergency line at 206-625-5011.\nIn response to the shooting, police plan to increase nighttime foot patrols in the area. Last year, after an increase of street crime on Capitol Hill, Seattle police instituted added patrols to the area.\nSam Osborne was in bed early Sunday morning, working on his computer, when he heard \u201ca pretty long burst of gunshots\u201d about a block away from his apartment building. Seconds later, he heard the first police sirens heading to the shooting scene, he said, noting the site is near the Seattle Police Department\u2019s East Precinct, at 12th Avenue and Pine Street.\n\u201cThe cops got there very quickly,\u201d he said, estimating that a dozen shots were fired.\nThe 23-year-old jumped out of bed, threw on his shoes and ran to the intersection to see if he could offer any help. He noticed plenty of people out, many of them smoking in front of area bars.\n\u201cI was stone-cold sober \u2026 but I think everybody was drunk and didn\u2019t know what was happening,\u201d Osborne said.\nWhen he got to the corner, paramedics were already loading a woman onto a stretcher, he said.\nOsborne saw one person lying in front of the plate-glass window, and another man, who had been shot in the leg, hopping on one foot in the middle of Pike Street without a shirt on. Police \u201cgot him under control\u201d and escorted him to an ambulance, Osborne said.\n\u201cWith 12 shots fired in that quick a succession, it\u2019s a miracle nobody\u2019s dead,\u201d he said Monday."}
