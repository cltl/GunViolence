Police got the call at 1:18 a.m.\n\u201cIf it was the little boy, he was a great, great kid,\u201d said Jimmey Bolin, who lives next door. \u201cWe have a little dog and he always wanted to pet the dog, and wave to him and say hi, and just, you know, it breaks your heart if it\u2019s the little boy.\u201d\nBolin said a young boy lived at the home with two older sisters and his mom and dad.\nA written press release issued this morning from the Benton Township Police Department reads; \u201cInitial indications are this was an accidental discharge of a weapon resulting in a fatality. No one else was injured at the residence. Names of the individuals involved are being withheld at this time while the incident remains under investigation.\u201d\nThe release goes on to say that two firearms were recovered at the scene and that both were registered to one of the residents.\nOutside the home today, toddler toys were scattered about the yard and a mini-van was parked in the driveway.\nFor neighbors, that sense of normalcy was shattered when police tape was added this morning.\n\u201cLast night I was just about to go to sleep and everything and I heard some kind of commotion and some screaming, so I came outside my door and about four or five cop cars rushed up and I seen \u2018em run inside,\u201d said Bolin. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had the cops down here. We rarely ever see the police down here and if it is, it\u2019s just driving down to the end of the road then turn around but, pretty quiet neighborhood.\u201d\nAt this point, police aren\u2019t saying if anyone was touching the gun when it went off, whether that be the boy or an adult.\nThe case has generated more than 150 comments on the WNDU Facebook page where some can\u2019t imagine any scenario in which a toddler and a gun would be in the same place at the same time, while others argue that people should wait for the facts and that this is a good family that is hurting due to an accident."}
