Travontay Berry was sentenced after being found guilty on Feb. 19. For the crime of carrying a firearm for purpose of going armed, Berry was ordered to serve 11 months and 29 days and pay a $2,500 fine. For the tampering with evidence charge, Berry was ordered to serve 4 years and has to pay a $5,000 fine. Those terms must be served consecutively. During the early morning hours of April 28, 2013, police were called to a shooting at Wolfe Enterprises at 438 E. Main Street. Officers arrived to find Brian Banes and Delandis Clark, both 31 and of Jackson, with apparent gunshot wounds. They were transported to Jackson-Madison County General Hospital where they were later pronounced dead. Two other gunshot victims arrived at the hospital via personal vehicles. The investigation determined there was an argument on the parking lot as a party was letting out. Berry was allegedly the first person to fire a semi-automatic handgun into the air while he was standing in a crowd of people. Anthony Montrell Swift, of Jackson, is accused of shooting Banes and Clark multiple times. After the shootings, police said that Berry left the scene and disposed of the weapon that he fired. Swift is charged with the murder of Brian Banes and Delandis Clark and is awaiting trial."}
