The pistol fired one round. Police said the bullet pierced a wall and struck Pizzolato's 10-year-old son in the cheek.\n\"He was putting his weapon away in a safe,\" said Monroe Police Capt. Michael Flick. \"Didn't realize he had a live round in the chamber.\"\nNo one else in the home was hurt, according to police, who said Pizzolato was shaken up after the incident.\nThe boy was taken to Bridgeport Hospital, then transferred to Yale-New Haven Hospital for treatment. Police described his injuries as substantial, but said they expect him to be OK.\nPizzolato turned himself in Tuesday evening. He was arrested and charged with unlawful discharge of a firearm, second-degree reckless endangerment and second-degree assault with a firearm.\nPizzolato was released on a promise to appear and is due in court March 25.\nThere was no answer at the door of the Pizzolato home when NBC Connecticut went to the family's home on Monday.\nPolice initially said the boy was 11 years old due to misinformation from his parents, according to Flick."}
