Pine St. and S. Mingo Ave. opened fire about 9:00 p.m., shooting and killing Chaz Fain, 18.\nThree other men in the apartment, two eighteen years old, one nineteen, were also shot but survived.\nHopkins then fled into the cold night, without even a jacket, and was arrested less than 90 minutes later in a nearby parking lot.\nAccording to an arrest and booking report obtained by KRMG, he confessed to the shooting after police read him his rights.\nHowever, in a statement to KRMG, Det. Sgt. Dave Walker of TPD says they don't know Hopkins' motive for the shootings.\nAll five men knew one another from attending classes at the Spartan School of Aeronautics, located just north of the apartment complex.\nResidents there tell KRMG only students of the school live at Spartan Landing.\nHopkins and two of the surviving victims lived in the apartment where the shootings occurred.\nFain and the other surviving victim also lived in the complex, but not in that apartment, Walker tells KRMG.\nPolice say Hopkins came to Tulsa from Alabama, Fain from Florida.\nThe Spartan School attracts students from around the world."}
