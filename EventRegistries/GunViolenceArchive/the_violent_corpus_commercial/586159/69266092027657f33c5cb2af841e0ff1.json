Eric Wright, 26, and Larry Watkins Jr. 26, were also injured. All three were taken to the hospital and are in stable condition.\nNone of the victims lived at the apartment complex. Officials said they were visiting friends.\n\"I don't want no violence. I get rid of them if they cause problems,\" Sealey Apartments owner Roosevelt Sealey said.\nSealey said he's owned the complex for 20 years.\n\"That will happen at every complex,\" Sealey said. \"Nothing you can do about that.\"\nDetectives said they believe the gunman meant to target some if not all of those victims, but they are unsure of the motive.\n\"It was in the back of her head. Very close call for her. It was unfortunate she was involved,\" said Detective Evelyn Estevez with the Altamonte Springs Police Department.\nThe gunmen remain at large."}
