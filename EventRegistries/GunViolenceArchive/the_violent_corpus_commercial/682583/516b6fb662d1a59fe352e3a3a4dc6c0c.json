A 15-year-old was also arrested on charges of attempted robbery, dealing marijuana and possession of marijuana.\nOfficers responded at around 12:24 p.m. to the Village Pantry at 904 W. Jefferson St., according to KPD Maj. Brian Seldon, where they found McGraw on the ground with several gunshot wounds.\nRucker allegedly fled the scene before police arrived, but was caught by officers several blocks away, with a handgun that police say was used in the shooting. According to Seldon, Rucker admitted to shooting McGraw after he was apprehended.\nAn additional weapon was found at the scene, and Seldon said it was possible gunfire was exchanged between the parties, but that is still under investigation.\nThe 15-year-old was taken into custody on the scene, which appeared to be a prearranged meeting place with all three people involved for a drug deal.\n\u201cIt is disturbing when you have these teenagers \u2026 involved in this sort of crime,\u201d said Seldon. \u201cIt is disturbing.\u201d\nSeldon said the relationship between McGraw, Rucker and the 15-year-old is under investigation, as is the case as a whole. Anyone with additional information is asked to contact Detective Chad Rodgers at 765-456-7350, or the Kokomo Police Hotline at 765-456-7017."}
