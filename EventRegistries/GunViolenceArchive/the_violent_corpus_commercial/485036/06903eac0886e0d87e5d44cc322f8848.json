They had been attending a vocational tech program off-campus and returned by bus shortly before school dismissed for the day.\nNorwood said the older student had forgotten he had a pistol in his vehicle. The sheriff said the younger student found it and was \"messing with it\" when it went off, shot through the driver-side seat and struck the 18-year-old in the back.\n\"It was nothing intentional, just friends and a little bit of stupidity mixed in,\" Norwood said.\nHe said the bullet struck only \"fatty tissue\" and the student's injury didn't require surgery.\nThe 17-year-old appeared in front of a juvenile magistrate Wednesday night, though Norwood said he could not discuss what, if any charges, that teen could face.\nThe investigation was continuing, and the 18-year-old could face a charge of possessing a firearm on school property, Norwood added."}
