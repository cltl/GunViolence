The officers were not wearing body cameras, he said, but investigators are looking at footage from their patrol car and cameras belonging to the housing authority.\nBased on the initial investigation, Beck said, it \u201cappears that the officers responded to a deadly threat appropriately.\u201d\nRisher\u2019s mother, Lisa Simpson, learned about her son\u2019s death when her daughter called her with the news later that night.\nSimpson, 47, was stunned. She called Risher\u2019s father, who shares the same name as his eldest child.\nRichard Risher, 39, didn\u2019t believe her at first and hung up the phone.\nWhen she called back, he said, he got into his car and sped to the housing project. The parents didn\u2019t leave the area until mid-morning the next day.\nEach questioned the police account, saying they didn\u2019t believe their son had a weapon.\nThe 18-year-old was with a group of people, his father said, and could have been running away from the gunfire when he was shot by police.\nRisher said that his son had been spending time in Nickerson Gardens but that he was encouraging the teen to move to his San Fernando Valley home to finish his high school diploma.\nThe younger Risher liked basketball and music, his parents said, and making people laugh.\n\u201cI always thought that my kids were going to outlive me,\u201d said Simpson, a paralegal who lives in Apple Valley. \u201cIf God let me trade places, I\u2019d trade places with my son right now.\u201d"}
