They went to that adjoining apartment where a man who was visibly upset said he was \u201cchecking my gun and it went off,\u201d according to the police report.\nThe toddler\u2019s mother told officers her daughter was asleep in that bedroom when she heard a \u201cloud bang,\u201d then ran into the room and grabbed her the child. The mother said she saw blood coming from her daughter\u2019s leg. Police said the wound was minor and she was not taken to a hospital after paramedics treated the girl.\nFurther investigation showed the hole from the shotgun round exited just above the little girl\u2019s bed, with debris from the wall and insulation scattered throughout her room. Back in the man\u2019s apartment next door, officers found a shotgun on the floor near the door inside his bedroom, police said.\nA roommate told police that the man\u2019s father, who he goes hunting with, had just returned the shotgun and he thought it was unloaded when he moved it, the report said.\nDan Scanlan: (904) 359-4549"}
