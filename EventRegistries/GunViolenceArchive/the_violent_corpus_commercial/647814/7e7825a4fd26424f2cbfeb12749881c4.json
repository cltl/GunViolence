The family is expected to address the media later today.\nBowers, 16, died Tuesday night after being shot in the back of the head near AlterFest while seeking to leave a dispute in which police said he was \u201can innocent bystander.\u201d\nThe Montgomery County Coroner\u2019s Office announced Bowers\u2019 death late Tuesday night. He was declared brain dead and his organs will be harvested, according to a coroner\u2019s investigator.\nA memorial service for Bowers is scheduled for Sunday in the Fairmont auditorium, 3301 Shroyer Road.\nFrom 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. the family will receive and greet visitors, according to the high school and Routsong Funeral Home. A service is scheduled for 2 p.m.\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine called the fatal shooting of Bowers near AlterFest Sunday night \u201ca horrible tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a parent\u2019s worst nightmare that your child is randomly shot,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrible.\u201d\nDeWine said there is no easy solution to the juvenile violence that has impacted the area.\n\u201cI\u2019m mostly convinced that what we really need to do is start in kindergarten, first grade, all the way to 12th grade, have something that is age specific \u2026 that also has some data behind it that actually works as far as education and prevention,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any easy answer. If there was an easy answer, we would have found it before now.\u201d\nKettering police said Wednesday morning they will wait until the department has an update on the charges in the shooting case before releasing any new information.\nThe Montgomery County Prosecutor\u2019s Office said Kettering Police had plans to meet again with the office to discuss charges against 18-year-old suspect Miles Heizer after he was released from custody Tuesday night, according to Greg Flannagan, spokesman for the prosecutors office.\nThat meeting was scheduled to take place in two weeks. However, it\u2019s unclear whether that will change now that Bowers has died from his injuries.\nThe suspects\nFour people \u2014 including three juveniles \u2014 were detained in connection to the shooting. Heizer was released from the Kettering jail, pending further investigation, police said Tuesday.\nOf the three juvenile suspects that remain in custody, one has a criminal record dating back to 2014. The two 16-year-old suspects have no prior criminal history with the juvenile court, according to the court administrator.\nHeizer has a previous charge of felonious assault stemming from a baseball bat attack in March. The three other teen suspects in Sunday\u2019s shooting were ordered detained by a judge Tuesday.\nThose three suspects \u2014 two of them are 16 and the third is 14 \u2014 appeared in the Montgomery County Juvenile Court on felonious assault charges, but there was no mention of who fired the shot that initially injured Bowers.\nThis news organization is not identifying the juveniles by name at this time.\nJuvenile Court Judge Anthony Capizzi said the juveniles will remain in custody until a Sept. 27 court date because they are \u201ccharged with heinous crimes\u201d with a \u201chigh-level of notoriety.\u201d\n\u201cI expect significant additional filings on this matter,\u201d Capizzi said.\nAccording to the second-degree felony charges, the suspects \u201cknowingly did cause serious physical harm\u201d to Bowers. One of the 16-year-olds also faces a charge of tampering with evidence. He is accused of trying to hide a firearm, Capizzi said.\nAll of the suspects and the victim are students at Kettering City Schools.\nPrior to Heizer\u2019s release from jail Tuesday, Kettering jail records indicated he had been in custody since early Monday morning on a felonious assault charge.\nHeizer was out on bond at the time of the shooting, stemming from a felonious assault arrest in March. The police report from that incident says he jumped out of a car at a traffic light, walked up to another car and hit a former classmate in the face with a baseball bat.\nCourt records show that the case was bound over to a grand jury months ago, but Heizer waived the right to speedy proceedings and there have been no filings in the case since April.\nSunday\u2019s incident\nThe shooting occurred at Willowdale Drive and Ackerman Boulevard about 9 p.m. Sunday.\nKettering Police Chief Christopher Protsman said the shooting had its roots in a weeks-long dispute between teenagers. Those teens were at Alter High School\u2019s festival Sunday night, where the issue flared again.\nProtsman said one group of four teens drove away, trying to avoid the altercation, but the four suspects followed in another car, eventually blocking them in a driveway on Willowdale Avenue, three blocks from Alter.\nProtsman said a physical altercation took place, and Bowers \u2014 who was trying to drive away \u2014 was shot once in the back of the head. Protsman said Bowers was an innocent bystander who was not involved in the ongoing dispute.\nA second person \u2014 a female \u2014 suffered a minor injury during the shooting that led to Bowers\u2019 death, according to a Kettering police report released Wednesday.\nKettering police have not released the details surrounding that female\u2019s injuries. A bag of marijuana also was seized during the police investigation, the report says.\nKettering Schools\u2019 response\nKettering Schools Superintendent Scott Inskeep said there were additional counselors, security and police at Fairmont High School on Tuesday morning. He said about 30 students took advantage of time to talk about the incident Tuesday morning.\nDan Von Handorf, Kettering\u2019s director of student services and former high school principal, said students were in shock and disbelief. The shooting came seven months after another Fairmont student, Antoine Jones, was killed in a Trotwood shooting that police said was drug-related.\nHeizer was a close friend of Jones, according to his social media accounts, but Von Handorf said school officials don\u2019t have any information that the two incidents are connected.\n\u201cYou have to be prepared. There is no ZIP code that is protected from these types of issues,\u201d Inskeep said. \u201cWe\u2019re always keeping an eye out for societal issues that may cause disruption or safety concerns at the schools.\u201d\nSome students mentioned on social media that they were scared or shaken up by the incident. Jace Roberts, a junior at Kettering\u2019s alternative school, said he feels safe at school, but questioned some students\u2019 attitude.\n\u201cKids these days think they\u2019re untouchable, can\u2019t get in trouble,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThink they can carry guns around and they\u2019re not going to shoot nobody, but they did.\u201d"}
