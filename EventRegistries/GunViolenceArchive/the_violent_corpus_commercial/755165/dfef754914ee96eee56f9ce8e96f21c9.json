The victim, who is expected to recover, merely described the suspect as a black man.\nJay Etzel, investigations commander of the Kankakee Police Department, said the shooting appeared to be drug-related based on evidence recovered from inside the victim's vehicle.\nAbout 25 minutes later, a 21-year-old Hispanic man was shot in his upper back at a home in the 300 block of South Rosewood Avenue.\nThe victim, who sustained nonlife-threatening injuries, was laying down inside a bedroom when someone allegedly shot him through an open window. Three other people were inside the room at the time.\nEtzel said the shooting appeared to be targeted, but declined to comment further due to the ongoing investigation.\nSo far this year, one person has been killed and at least six others have been injured in shootings within city limits. Last year, the city had five homicides, two of which were caused by gunfire.\n\"It's completely unacceptable,\" 7th Ward Ald. Fred Tetter said. \"Any time there's a shooting in the city, it should be concerning to all members of the community. I'm tired of us reacting. We need to be more proactive. We have to do that collectively.\""}
