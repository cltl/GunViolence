Right now, Pruner is in critical condition.\n\u201cIt definitely sucks,\u201d said Pruner\u2019s friend Zachary Rees. \u201cI knew he was definitely going to be in critical condition when I saw him lying on the ground and his face and everything was just nothing I\u2019d ever seen before.\u201d\nRees says he hadn\u2019t been home more than fifteen minutes last night when police cruisers and ambulances started to pack Little Leaf Court around 2 a.m.\nNeighbor Gary Patterson says he\u2019s still shocked that someone was shot right in front of his home.\n\u201cWe moved here because it\u2019s really quiet,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cAnd our friends, our best friends have lived here all their life and they\u2019ve never had a problem. So you know, then we move here. Nothing. Then we wake up to this.\u201d\nRees says he\u2019s glad officers arrested Zweck and he hopes there\u2019s justice for Pruner.\n\u201cEven if it was an accident or not, he still needs something out of it. You can\u2019t just shoot nobody and get away with it,\u201d said Rees."}
