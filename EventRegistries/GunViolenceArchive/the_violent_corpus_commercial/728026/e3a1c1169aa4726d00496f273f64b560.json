She told police he was driving the car Saturday and had a semi-automatic pistol in his lap. He became angry because he thought a car behind him was following too closely, and he pulled over to let the car pass.\nAcen was in the back seat with his 1-year-old brother. Their grandmother said she was unaware the car was hit and she drove on to a J.C. Penney about nine miles away. There she noticed Acen was hurt and called 911.\nThe grandmother told police the incident began when a man in a car behind her at a stop sign started honking his horn, apparently upset she wasn't moving quickly enough. The grandmother honked her horn, too.\n\"She didn't know he was shot,\" a bystander told the 911 operator after speaking with the grandmother. One of the callers, describing to the 911 operator what happened, said the grandmother feverishly performed CPR after the child sustained a neck wound.\nCNN's Jay Croft, Shawn Nottingham and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report."}
