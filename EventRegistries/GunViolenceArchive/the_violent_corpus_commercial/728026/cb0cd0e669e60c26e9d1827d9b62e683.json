(KTHV) - On Saturday night, Little Rock police were on scene at the J.C. Penney on Shackleford Road in response to a shooting. Officers said the shooting didn't happen at the store, but that's where the driver took the car after the shooting.\nIn a statement released late Saturday night, the Little Rock Police Department said a road rage incident is what lead to the shooting. According to police, Kim King-Macon said the suspect honked his horn at her at a stop sign and she honked back.\nThat's when the suspect shot once at King-Macon's vehicle. The LRPD determined the shooting happened at the 6700 block of Mabelvale Cutoff.\nPolice say a three-year-old inside the vehicle was shot during the commotion. The child later died from the injuries sustained at the hospital. This marks the 40th homicide of the year in Little Rock and the second fatal shooting of a young child in less than a month.\n\"That is very, very frustrating to our police agency as it should be to our community,\" Buckner said. \u201cWe cannot have a community where the least protected among us, being infants, are dying [in] senseless crimes.\u201d\nA one-year-old was also in the car with his grandmother during the shooting. King-Macon then drove to the J.C. Penney parking lot before calling the police.\nPolice are looking for an older black Chevrolet Impala that's being driven by a black male.\nPolice are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the suspect.\nIf you have any information, you are asked to contact the Major Crimes at 501-371-4660."}
