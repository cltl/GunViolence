Penney in west Little Rock before 6:30 p.m. The child died from his injuries a short time later.\nLt. Steve McClanahan said in an email after 10 p.m. that investigators have determined the shooting happened during a \"road rage incident\" in southwest Little Rock.\n\"The grandmother was driving the car and was taking her grandson shopping when the incident occurred,\" McClanahan wrote. \"We believe she and the victim were completely innocent and they have no relationship with the suspect.\"\n[UPDATE: City offers $20,000 reward for information in 3-year-old's killing]\nAccording to a Little Rock police incident report released Sunday, the grandmother, 47-year-old Kim King-Macon of Little Rock, was driving with the 3-year-old and a 1-year-old in her 2006 Dodge Charger when the shooting happened in the 6700 block of Mabelvale Cutoff Road.\nKing-Macon told police a black Chevrolet Impala pulled up behind her while she was stopped at a traffic light and honked its horn, the report said, noting King-Macon then honked back.\n\"Ms. King-Macon stated that a black male then exited [the Impala] and fired one shot,\" the report said, adding King-Macon then drove to the shopping center and found the boy had been shot when she got him out of the vehicle.\nNo arrests have been made.\nThe shooting is the second in less than a month where a toddler has been fatally shot in Little Rock. A 2-year-old girl was fatally injured Nov. 22 by shots fired into her vehicle near South Harrison Street and West Charles Bussey Avenue.\n\"As you can probably understand that's very, very frustrating to our police agency, as it should be to our community,\" Little Rock police chief Kenton Buckner said, speaking Saturday night in the store parking lot near where the vehicle was marked off in crime-scene tape. \"... We cannot have a community to where the least protected among us \u2014 being infants \u2014 are dying [in] these senseless crimes in our city.\"\nAnyone with information about the Impala or its driver is asked to call investigators at (501) 371-4660.\n8:45 p.m. update\nA young boy was fatally shot while riding in a vehicle in Little Rock Saturday, the second similar case in the city in less than month, authorities said.\nPolice responded shortly after 6:20 p.m. to the parking lot of the J.C.

He encouraged anyone with information to call police\n\"This is about as frustrated as you can be as a public safety official or just a plain citizen who is sitting watching this tonight to think that these kinds of things are occurring in our city streets,\" Buckner said.\nThe death marks Little Rock's 40th homicide of the year.\nEARLIER\nA 3-year-old child has died after being found shot at a Little Rock department store, authorities said.\nPolice were called shortly after 6:20 p.m. to the J.C.
