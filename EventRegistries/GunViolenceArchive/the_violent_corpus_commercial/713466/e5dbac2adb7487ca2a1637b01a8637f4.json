He pointed the pistol to his head when Houston police arrived. The man also fired the pistol more than once while he was inside, but there were no injuries, police said.\nHPD SWAT officers surrounded the restaurant. The man ran outside and slipped through the police cordon. HPD officers at the scene said no one fired at him because they didn't see him holding a weapon.\nSCARY MOMENTS: Officer kills robber at Raising Cane's\nPolice said the man ran toward an abandoned bank building across from the parking lot. He pulled out a pistol and shot through the glass door to gain entrance.\nHe again fired his pistol while inside the building but again there were no reported injuries.\nPolice said a shotgun carried by one of the officers inadvertently fired. Another HPD officer was grazed by a bullet. The noise apparently started an HPD canine who then bit one of the police officers there, officials said.\nThe two officers were taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries. The man inside the abandoned building was later taken into custody without incident.\nThe suspect was taken into custody, and the investigation is continuing, police said."}
