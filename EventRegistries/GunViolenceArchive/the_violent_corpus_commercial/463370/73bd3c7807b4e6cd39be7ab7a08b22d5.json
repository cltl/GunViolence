One of them has a gunshot wound in his shoulder after accidentally shooting himself, police said.\nOfficers responded to the home in the 8300 block of Shoal Creek shortly before 10 p.m. They said a 52-year-old woman told them the trouble began after she answered a knock on her door.\n\u201cWhen she opened the door, she initially thought it was a joke because the person was pointing what she thought was a toy gun at her,\u201d said Sandra Pickell, a spokeswoman for SAPD.\nBut Pickell said the woman quickly realized he was serious. A second armed man came out of hiding and both men forced their way inside the home, she said.\nThe woman's two sons, 14 and 15 years old, came home in the middle of the incident. The gunmen ordered them to lie on the floor and demanded their valuables.\nPolice said the woman began struggling with one of the gunmen over a jewelry box and the robber\u2019s gun went off. The intruder suffered a gunshot wound to his shoulder.\nBoth men ran from the home.\nAt the home Friday, no one there wanted to talk about the incident on camera. However, one man did point out the apparent direction in which the suspects headed. The path was clearly marked by a trail of blood from the suspect\u2019s shoulder wound.\nPolice hope it will put them on the trail of the robbers.\n\u201cWe're hoping that when he seeks medical attention we'll be able to get more information that leads us to the identity of these suspects,\u201d Pickell said.\nCopyright 2015 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}
