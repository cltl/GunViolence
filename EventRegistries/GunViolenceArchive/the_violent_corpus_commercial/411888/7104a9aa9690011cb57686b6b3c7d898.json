While the officers were still en route, the dispatcher added that the man with the gun was high on narcotics and that the caller was being uncooperative, the deputy said in his incident report.\nWhen the deputy arrived, he saw a man walking from the residence where the shots had allegedly been fired. He and Berlin Police Chief Timothy Weathers forced the man to the ground at gunpoint, and another officer handcuffed him without further incident.\nThe man \u201cappeared under the influence and was hallucinating,\u201d the deputy reported.\nA neighbor said the man had been shooting at objects and acting out of his head.
