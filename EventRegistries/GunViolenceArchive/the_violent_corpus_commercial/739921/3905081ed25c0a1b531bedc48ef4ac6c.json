Martinez shot in head by 'stray bullet' while celebrating", "dct": "Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT", "id": "3905081ed25c0a1b531bedc48ef4ac6c", "content": "NORTH OF WESLACO \u2014 State Rep. Armando \u201cMando\u201d Martinez confirmed Sunday evening that he\u2019s now doing well after being shot in the head earlier that morning by what local law enforcement authorities are calling a stray bullet.\nMartinez said family and friends were celebrating the New Year at a residence located on the 5400 block of Sago, which is located just outside of Weslaco, when they began to hear gunfire.\nThey sought shelter inside a garage until just before midnight, when Martinez said he could no longer hear the shooting. The state representative for District 39 then ventured back outside with his wife and children to see the rest of the fireworks.\n\u201cAt the stroke of midnight, my wife comes over and gives me a hug and a kiss, and right after that I felt like a sledgehammer hitting the back of my head,\u201d Martinez said in description of the pain suffered from a gunshot. \u201cI grabbed it and she said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 I said I was hit by something.\u201d\nRemembering how a friend, a state trooper with the Texas Department of Public Safety, described the pain of being shot in the face as \u201ca sledgehammer hitting you,\u201d Martinez feared he had become the victim of a revelers\u2019 bullet.\nThe representative\u2019s fears were confirmed when a cousin who took a photo of Martinez\u2019s head observed what appeared to be a bullet hole.\n\u201cBefore, the Valley wasn\u2019t as populated as it is now, and growing up you used to hear gunshots many times,\u201d Martinez said after crediting Weslaco firefighters and paramedics for their quick response in transporting him to a local hospital. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do that now because somebody\u2019s going to end up getting hurt. Unfortunately, last night it was me who got hurt. The fact that my family and friends were there and that they could\u2019ve also gotten hurt pushes me to help put a stop to this. Right now, the important thing is that I\u2019m alive \u2026 God blessed me.\u201d\nMartinez underwent a 45-minute surgical procedure to remove the bullet, which was then collected by the Hidalgo County Sheriff\u2019s Office for testing.\nSheriff Eddie Guerra has confirmed that his office launched a deadly conduct investigation into the shooting.\nJose P. Rodriguez, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office, also used the incident as an opportunity to once again discourage residents against firing weapons in the air.\n\u201cWe want to remind the public that celebratory gunfire is very dangerous and can cause property damage, and cause serious injury or death,\u201d Rodriguez said.\nMonitor staff writer Lorenzo Zazueta-Castro contributed to this report."}
