Crimestoppers has increased the reward for information to $10,000.\nAccording to NOPD, 20-year-old Quendrick \"C4\" Bailey, 19-year-old Lawrence \"L\" Veals, 29-year-old Michael \"Mack\" Allen and 22-year-old Rashad \"KMG EZZY\" Walker are all wanted for 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder. Veals and Walker both surrendered not long after their names were made public.\nThe shooting occurred Nov. 22 at Bunny Friend Playground in the 1900 block of Gallier Street. Police say several hundred people were at the playground for a block party and impromptu music video filming when at least two groups of people started shooting at each other.\n\"There are certain gangs around the Bunny Friend park, there is the KMG Gang, Killer Mafia Gang, the Killer Square Goonies Gang, there are the Park Boys in the Lower Ninth Ward,\" said NOPD Commader Chris Goodly. \"Some of these individuals may be cross-associated with several of the gangs.\"\nAlong with their possible gang affiliations, the suspects are familiar with the criminal justice system. Bailey has been charged with possessing a stolen firearm, and just two days after the Bunny Friend shooting, police arrested him for attempted escape and drugs. But police say he's no longer behind bars.\nVeals, the youngest he was booked last year with illegal possession of a firearm and possession of synthetic pot. Walker has a long list of charges that including driving stolen cars and burglary. \u201cMack\u201d Allen has drug charges dating back a decade, several of which were never prosecuted. And most recently, a drug conviction got him only a suspended sentence.\nNow police are determined to put the four behind bars and keep them there.\n\u201cWe know who you are, we know who you associate with, and we are coming after you,\u201d NOPD Chief Michael Harrison said. \u201cThis is not a game, and we are not playing with you.\u201d\nPolice said the latest group of suspects was developed through witness participation and Crimestoppers tips.\nThe first suspect named, 32-year-old Joseph \"Moe\" Allen, turned himself in to police on Nov. 28. He refused to provide a statement to detectives and remains in custody, according to NOPD.\nPolice believe several other suspects were involved in the shooting.
