Like the other five suspects currently in custody, Offray faces 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder \u2013 one for each person wounded in the gunfire that broke out on Nov. 22 inside the Upper 9th Ward park.\nNew Orleans police have taken some criticism after the first suspect identified by detectives \u2013 Joseph \"Moe\" Allen \u2013 was cleared of all charges. Allen had been in Texas at the time of the park shooting, and his attorney produced surveillance footage showing Allen and his pregnant wife shopping at three different Houston-area stores.\nAnother suspected park gunman, Michael \"Mack\" Allen, has also proclaimed his innocence, his attorney said during Allen's initial court appearance Wednesday.\nBut NOPD Superintendent Michael Harrison defended the department's investigation, which thus far has identified nine total suspects \u2013 three of whom remain at large.\n\"We want to be thorough, and we want to, obviously, have the right people,\" Harrison said Wednesday, a few minutes before Joseph Allen was officially released from jail. \"While it would be good, I presume, to give people the benefit of the doubt, it is our duty to investigate to seek the truth and find the evidence.\"\nDetectives are still searching for Wilfred \"Lil Wilfred\" Celestine, 17; Quendrick \"C4\" Bailey, 20; and Shawn \"Shooter\" Ruffin, 22.\nAnyone with information about there whereabouts should contact Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111."}
