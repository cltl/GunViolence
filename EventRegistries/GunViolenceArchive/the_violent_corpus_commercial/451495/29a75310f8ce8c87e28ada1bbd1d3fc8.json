As many as 300 people were wandering throughout the Upper 9th Ward park when the shots rang through the air.\nOne witness, a nurse who would not give her name, said it sounded like New Year's Eve, when celebratory gunfire often occurs, all over again.\nPeople scattered everywhere. Three witnesses said they saw a man with a silver-colored machine gun head toward Louisa Avenue. They also heard more gunshots coming from within the crowd as he ran away.\nNew Orleans police officers had been monitoring the second line, but witnesses say they were beginning to disperse as the after party kept going. As soon as gunshots were heard, however, officers were on the scene immediately, witnesses said.\nSeveral victims were lying on the sidewalk along Gallier Street sidewalk after the chaos died down a bit.\nMayor Mitch Landrieu has arrived at the scene.\nCheck back with NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune for more details."}
