They\u2019ve been out here since 10 p.m., digging up every piece of information that we can find and (trying) to connect the dots,\u201d Lemma said.\nCouple's history with police\nThe couple's domestic violence issues were documented last December when the Altamonte Springs Police Department responded to a report of domestic violence between the couple at Crescent Place Condos.\nChericia Brown, 31, claimed that her husband, Henry Brown, 30, had attacked her and threatened to kill her and their two children, an incident report said.\nThe responding officer reported that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to make an arrest, and because Chericia Brown had moved out of the home, authorities didn\u2019t believe that there was a reason to worry about violence in the future.\n\u201cDue to the fact that (the victim) will not be returning to the home and has not returned in 48 hours, the fear of further violence does not exist,\u201d the report said.\nHenry Brown told the officer that his wife was making up the story because she found out that he was having an affair, the report said.\nAn assistant state attorney agreed with the officer\u2019s assessment of the situation, and said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d in a Feb. 10 letter to Chericia Brown.\n\u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group."}
