Neighbors in the area reported hearing as many as nine shots in rapid succession.\nOfficers were searching a large swath of Powell St., hoping to piece together what exactly happened. Details were very sparse as police cordoned off two separate areas on Powell St., and an officer on scene could only confirm that two victims had been taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds."}
