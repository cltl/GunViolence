The relationships between the victims is still being determined. Autopsies have been scheduled for Thursday morning in Newberry.\nAlthough Orangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenell said his department has not identified a suspect or determined a motive for the shooting, it is following many \u201cgood leads\u201d and he encourages anyone with information about the shooting to come forward.\n\u201cWe will not rest until we arrest the person that killed these individuals,\u201d Ravenell said.\nState and local law enforcement agencies stepped up to help track down the killer or killers.\n\u201cJust as we realized the magnitude of this tragedy, particularly when children are involved, these agencies sent officers to assist us,\u201d Ravanell said Wednesday evening.\nRavenell said sheriff\u2019s deputies responded to the residence just after 7 a.m. after receiving a call from an unidentified male regarding a shooting at the home. When deputies arrived, they found the Butler dead from an apparent gunshot wound in the front yard of the home.\nInside the home, Ravenell said, deputies located Perry and Sanders, who had been apparently shot in one bedroom, while Hutto was shot in a separate bedroom.
