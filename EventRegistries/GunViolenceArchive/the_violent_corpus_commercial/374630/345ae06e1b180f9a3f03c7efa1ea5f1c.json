He is newly charged with three counts of unlawful neglect of a child, obstruction of justice and trafficking crack cocaine.\n\u201cBecause of this man, because of his lifestyle, because of the way he wanted to live, we have four people dead and one in the hospital,\u201d Ravenell said.\nFour people were found shot to death in Wright\u2019s home at 7050 Old State Road, Holly Hill on July 15. They were two of Wright\u2019s daughters \u2013 Tamara Alexia Perry, 14 and Shamekia Sanders, 17 -- his fianc\u00e9e, Krystal Hutto, and a male acquaintance, Jerome Butler.\nHis 8-year-old son, Dreamzz Nelson, was also shot in the head. Nelson is receiving medical care at a Charleston-area hospital.\nRavenell said Wright has not shared what he knows about the July 15 killings with the authorities.\n\u201cI believe Mr. Wright knows more than what he\u2019s telling us, which is nothing,\u201d Ravenell said.\n\u201cThe incident that occurred on July 15 at 7050 Old State Road is because of Christopher Dean Wright,\u201d Ravenell said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the father and because of his lifestyle, his kids are no longer here. And not only that, why would you not cooperate with investigators?\u201d Ravenell said.\nWright\u2019s attorney, David Williams, said at the bond hearing that Wright has talked with at least three Orangeburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigators and taken a lie-detector test.\nWright wasn\u2019t at 7050 Old State Road when the murders took place, Williams said. He returned to the home to discover the bodies and called 911.\n\"He was the first to come on the scene. He was the first to call 911. He had to see this unfortunate event,\" Williams said.\nWright allegedly sold 13.2 grams and 14 grams of crack cocaine to a confidential informant on June 21, 2013. The State Law Enforcement Division conducted those \u201ccontrolled purchases,\u201d according to arrest warrants, at 7050 Old State Road."}
