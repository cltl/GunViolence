I might fight somebody. As you can see, my record\u2019s consistent with that, like I will fight you.\n\u201cAs far as committing other things with guns, everybody totes them. That\u2019s like life because of so many things going on in the streets right now.\u201d\nThe Disciple Way man was arrested by the Orangeburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office Tuesday on charges of second or subsequent offense failure to stop for blue light and two counts of possession of a controlled substance.\nLaw enforcement officers also wanted to talk to Smith about the four people killed at 7050 Old State Road, near Holly Hill, on July 15.\nThe victims were Tamara Alexia Perry, 14; Shamekia Tyjuana Sanders, 17; Krystal Hutto, 28; and Jerome Butler, 50.\nOrangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenell said on Thursday that the multiple homicide investigation has been non-stop since it was first called in.\n\u201cWe want to assure the community we have been tracing out every new lead, interviewing anyone even remotely connected with it, including Mr. Smith,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t rest until this is resolved.\u201d\nFirst Judicial Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe told the court that Smith has an outstanding warrant in Summerville for criminal domestic violence and a Berkeley County General Sessions bench warrant for failing to appear in court on a strong-arm robbery charge.\n\u201cHe\u2019s from Berkeley County, but he\u2019s very transient and can be hard to locate,\u201d Pascoe said.\nGodwin said he and another investigator were assembling a team of officers to \u201cbasically go in and get him because we didn\u2019t want to take any chances with his history of fighting officers, failure to stop for blue light, his prior criminal history.\u201d\nAs they waited for other officers to arrive, Smith \u201ccame out and attempted to get in his vehicle and leave,\u201d Godwin said.\n\u201cHe was sitting stationary in his car. He recognized us as police. We had our blue lights on and he chose right then and there to flee the scene,\u201d Godwin said.\nGodwin said Smith led them on a chase that exceeded 100 mph down Mingo Street, Goff Avenue, back down Mingo Street and through the \u201cBojangles parking lot every bit of 80 mph at 12:15 in the afternoon,\u201d Godwin said."}
