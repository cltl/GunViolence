Mark Baker said.\n\u201cThere is no indication there was any foul play. There is no reason to believe anything else happened,\u201d Baker said.\nThe shooting happened Saturday at 11:15 p.m. Davis was sleeping in a chair at the home of his friend, Gregory Lambert, 19. The home is at 4251 Reservoir Road, authorities said.\nLambert was hunting groundhogs earlier in the day and left his .22 caliber rifle on his bed after he finished. Lambert left Davis sleeping in a chair and was going to go to bed himself, authorities said.\nLambert attempted to remove the rifle from the bed at which time he somehow pulled the trigger as he grabbed the rifle. The round struck Davis in the mouth knocking out a tooth and lodging into Davis throat, authorities said.\nWhen deputies and emergency responders arrived at the house, Davis was up and walking, holding a towel to his mouth. Davis told a deputy he woke after something happened to his mouth.\nThe incident appears to be an accident with a rifle from careless gun handling, Baker said.\nThe case will be presented to the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to determine if any charges will be filed. At most, Baker said it would be a negligent assault, which is a misdemeanor.\nReach Greg Sowinski at 567-242-0464 or on Twitter @Lima_Sowinski."}
