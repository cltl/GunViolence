They announced on Monday that they could confirm Villegas-Hernandez, 34, was in Mexican police custody.\nOn Tuesday, Gov. Susana Martinez met with relatives of the victims and said her office would work with federal officials and authorities in Mexico for the quick extradition of Villegas-Hernandez.\nBut on Thursday, state Attorney General Hector Balderas, whose office is in charge of all extraditions to the sate, said Villegas-Hernandez had just been taken into the official custody of Interpol for formal extradition proceedings.\n\u201cI am thankful for the hard work of our state, federal, and international partners, and Villegas-Hernandez is now in the custody of Interpol in Hermosillo. He is being processed and will then be transferred to Mexico City pending extradition,\u201d Balderas said in a statement.\nVillegas-Hernandez returns to face grand jury indictments on five counts of first-degree murder for the shooting deaths of his wife, 34, and the four girls, Yamilen, 14, Cynthia Janet, 11, Abby, 7, and Ida, 3. A grand jury also indicted him on four counts of intentional abuse of a child resulting in death for each child, said Roswell police spokesman Todd Wildermuth.\nCynthia Villegas had recently asked for a divorce, police have said.\nWildermuth said his department has handed off extradition effort to the state AG\u2019s Office.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put it in their hands,\u201d he said.\nAuthorities have said Villegas-Hernandez has dual citizenship in the United States and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, so he must be extradited and cannot be deported.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}
