And maybe (the sheriff\u2019s office) has maybe had a problem ... keeping up with that.\u201d\nJosh Rogers, chief executive officer of NewTown Macon, said that despite Saturday\u2019s shooting, downtown remains one of the safest precincts month to month.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is entirely a policing issue,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI think all of us have some responsibility here to adapt and change and make sure that we\u2019re providing the safest environment possible. ...I think the business community needs to respond with a unanimous voice that we\u2019ve got really high expectations for business owners operating safe businesses. And that means adhering to local laws but also shutting down at the hours that bars are supposed to close at 2 a.m., and making sure people get home safely and not serving people beyond the time that they\u2019re intoxicated.\u201d\nGrant announced Monday that the lounge is changing its policies. It will no longer allow anyone under the age of 21 to enter the business. In a news release, Grant said he plans to meet with the sheriff\u2019s office this week in hopes of increasing a law enforcement presence on Poplar Street. Starting this week, Grant said, the lounge will open at 2 p.m. instead of 7 p.m. and close at 2 a.m. instead of 2:30 a.m.\nRogers said Saturday morning\u2019s shooting was a setback to downtown\u2019s image.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got to express on the front end that we want business owners to operate to the highest standards now and always (so) people are going to be safe when they come downtown,\u201d he said.\nThe nightlife crowd has doubled or even tripled over the past year, Rogers said, and people are no longer coming downtown to hear just one band or visit one single venue. Instead, they\u2019re coming to visit several venues.\n\u201cI think this is a growing pain and a challenge (for downtown Macon),\u201d Rogers said of the weekend shooting. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got to band together -- the business community, our local legislators and the sheriff\u2019s department -- so that we\u2019re responding properly.\u201d\nMel Howard, who operates Grant\u2019s Lounge and who was there early Saturday, said two men who left Grant\u2019s started fighting in the middle of Poplar Street. About 15 people surrounded the tussle. Though there were seven security officers working at Grant\u2019s at the time, Howard said none of them could intervene.\n\u201cMy security officers aren\u2019t really allowed to go in the street to try to break up anything, so we made the (911) phone calls,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThe next thing we knew there was gunshots.\u201d\nAccording to a sheriff\u2019s office incident report, a large fight broke out and several shots were fired during the brawl. Jamel Ramon Nolton, 37, of Macon, was arrested near Poplar and Third streets.\nThe report said one of the wounded victims was lying on the ground when he looked up and told an officer, \u201cThat\u2019s the guy who shot me,\u201d as Nolton was being apprehended.\nA sheriff\u2019s office news release said five people were wounded in the shooting. Nolton was charged with five counts of aggravated assault, one count of violation of probation, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and giving a false name to a law enforcement officer. He was denied bond on all charges at a hearing Monday and is being held in the Bibb County jail.\nTo contact writer Laura Corley, call 744-4382."}
