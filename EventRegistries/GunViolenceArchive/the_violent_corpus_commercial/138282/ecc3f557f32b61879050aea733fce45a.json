It documents what transpired on May 23, 2014, when a 22-year old college student embarked on a premeditated, murderous rampage by stabbing three people to death inside his Isla Vista apartment. He then committed a series of drive-by shootings and deliberately struck numerous people with his car, killing three additional victims and wounding fourteen more. During this time he engaged in two separate gun-battles with sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies, and was wounded before ultimately taking his own life.\nSadly, terrible crimes such as this occur far too frequently. A recent FBI report indicates that 160 mass or active shootings occurred in public places in the USA between 2000 and 2013, resulting in the murder of 486 people and the wounding of 557 others. Most disturbingly, the study showed that the annual rate of these crimes is trending upwards.\nIn the aftermath of such senseless tragedies, the question always asked is, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What can be done to save lives by preventing similar crimes in the future?\u00e2\u20ac Unfortunately, there is no single or simple solution to the complex problems that lie beneath that question.\nIn California, we have some of the strongest gun control laws in the nation, yet in this case the suspect was still able to legally purchase and possess three handguns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Many suspects in mass murder incidents suffer from severe mental illness that is untreated or under-treated, yet in this instance the suspect was receiving treatment and had been since childhood.\nNevertheless, more can and must be done to ensure that those who died were not lost in vain. In the wake of this tragedy, steps are being taken that provide some hope for the future. Legislation was passed encouraging peace officers to make greater use of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firearms registry during welfare checks, and giving law enforcement officers and families the ability to obtain gun violence restraining orders allowing firearms to be temporarily impounded in certain cases where public safety is believed to be at risk. Efforts are also underway to remove more guns from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153armed and prohibited\u00e2\u20ac persons, and to blend law enforcement and mental health professionals into effective crisis response teams. There remain a number of additional unmet needs we must strive to address in the future. These include greater recognition and early intervention in cases of mental illness, improved community-based treatment, and providing more forensic mental health facilities and programs as alternatives to jail.\nWhat is unusual in this case is the extent of the written and video-taped record of thoughts, feelings and intentions left by a suspect who, in retrospect, clearly suffered from significant mental illness that ultimately resulted in homicidal and suicidal rage. It is our hope that a thorough review of these materials by mental health professionals and the F.B.I.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Behavioral Research and Instruction Unit (BRIU), in essence the conducting of a psychological autopsy, will result in findings that will assist in the development of new and improved intervention techniques and practices related to the cause, identification and treatment of such pathologies.\nAll of these actions must be taken with great care not to stigmatize the mentally ill and thereby discourage them from seeking treatment. We must understand that the vast majority of mentally\nill people are not violent, and that mental illness, like physical illness, can usually be effectively treated if properly diagnosed. The results are enhanced quality of life and increased public safety.\nIn closing, I convey my deepest sympathy to the families of all those who perished in Isla Vista on that awful evening, as well as my gratitude that those who were wounded survived \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thanks in some instances to the fine medical care they received. I am proud of the detectives, forensic and coroner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personnel who investigated and handled the aftermath of this heinous crime with great ability and compassion. Lastly, I commend the dispatchers and first responders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c deputy sheriffs, police officers, emergency medical personnel and firefighters alike \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose swift, courageous, skillful and resolute actions that evening prevented many more deaths.\nBILL BROWN Sheriff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Coroner Santa Barbara County\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe purpose of this report is to describe the chain of events leading up to the six homicides,\nfourteen attempted murders, and one suicide that occurred in Isla Vista, California, on May 23,\n2014. This report documents the actions of the suspect, the tragic consequences of those actions,\nand the investigative follow-up. The report concludes that no prosecution is necessary as the\nperpetrator of the crimes is deceased.\nIt is not the intent of this report to convey every piece of information contained in the voluminous\ninvestigation materials developed by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office and other law\nenforcement agencies. Rather, this report is meant to provide a cogent body of information that\nwill provide some answers for the victims, the victims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 families and the public.\nOn May 23, 2014, the suspect went on a murderous rampage in the community of Isla Vista, which\nis an unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County adjacent to the campus of the University of\nCalifornia, Santa Barbara. A chronological summary of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions that evening is as\nfollows:\n1. The suspect murdered his two roommates and one of their friends in his apartment at 6598 Seville Road #7, Isla Vista by stabbing them to death.\nThe three victims were murdered separately as they entered the apartment\nat different times during May 23, 2014.\n2. Several hours after the initial murders, but minutes prior to the subsequent events, the suspect uploaded a self-made video onto the Internet entitled\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retribution,\u00e2\u20ac and emailed a 137-page autobiographical manifesto to\nfamily members and acquaintances expressing anxiety, severe unhappiness\nand anger. The online posting and email that afternoon and evening\nforeshadowed the events that were soon to occur.\n3. Minutes later the suspect drove to a sorority house at 840 Embarcadero Del Norte, where he pounded on the front door trying to gain entry.\nUnsuccessful in this attempt, he returned to his vehicle, and then shot three\nfemale students on the public sidewalk, killing two and severely wounding\nthe third.\n4. He then drove to the area of 6560 Pardall Road, where he fired a round into a closed and unoccupied building in an apparent attempt to shoot the\noccupants. Continuing eastbound to 6549 Pardall Road, he then shot and\nkilled a male victim standing in front of the market at that location.\n5. At 924 Embarcadero Del Norte the suspect used his vehicle to intentionally strike a male victim, causing injury.\n6. As he continued to drive, he shot two victims, a male and a female, in front of 6533 Trigo Road, wounding them both.\nPage | 1\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\n7. He shot and wounded the next victim, a female, near the intersection of El Embarcadero and Sabado Tarde.\n8. He continued south on El Embarcadero to a point just north of the intersection of Del Playa Drive and El Embarcadero, where he shot at, but\nmissed, a female pedestrian.\n9. On Del Playa Drive, just east of the intersection of El Embarcadero, a sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy shot one round at the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle as the suspect shot\nat the deputy.\n10. The suspect continued driving west on Del Playa Drive and, at 6653 Del Playa, the suspect used his vehicle to intentionally strike two male victims,\ninjuring them both.\n11. The suspect continued driving as he shot and wounded a male victim who was walking on Camino Del Sur just south of Sabado Tarde.\n12. At 6688 Sabado Tarde, the suspect intentionally struck with his vehicle and injured a male victim riding his skateboard.\n13. At 6636 Sabado Tarde, the suspect intentionally struck with his vehicle and injured a male victim who was riding his bicycle.\n14. Near 6620 Sabado Tarde the suspect intentionally struck and injured a male pedestrian with his vehicle.\n15. As the suspect continued driving eastbound on Sabado Tarde, he shot and wounded a male pedestrian walking in front of 6573 Sabado Tarde. Almost\nsimultaneously, the suspect shot and wounded another male victim in the\nsame vicinity.\n16. Near the intersection of El Embarcadero and Sabado Tarde, the suspect and three sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies engaged in a gun battle during which the\nsuspect was wounded in the left hip.\n17. At 6584 Del Playa the suspect intentionally struck and injured a male cyclist with his vehicle. He then committed suicide by shooting himself\nwhile still driving his vehicle. The suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle subsequently crashed\ninto another vehicle and came to a stop.\nThe suspect used several large hunting-type knives in the stabbings, a Sig Sauer P226 9mm semi-\nautomatic pistol in the shootings, and a 2008 black BMW 328i sedan in the vehicular assaults.\nThe response to these crimes began with the receipt of the first 9-1-1 call into the Santa Barbara\nCounty Emergency Communications Center (dispatch) at 21:27:261 hours (9:27 p.m.). The caller\nreported hearing gunshots in the area and a subsequent call reported a shooting at the intersection\nof Embarcadero Del Norte and Segovia Road. Santa Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office (Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nOffice) deputies and University of California, Santa Barbara Police Department (UCSB PD)\n1 All times listed in this report utilize the military 24-hour system.\nPage | 2\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nofficers assigned to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (a combined Sheriff and University Police effort)\nwere already in the area and self-dispatched upon hearing the gunfire. By 21:28:02 hours, law\nenforcement officers were on-scene of the first fatal shooting location and began rendering aid. At\n21:29:55 hours, other officers were on-scene of the second fatal shooting location at 6549 Pardall\nRoad and attempted to render aid to that victim. In conjunction with one of the first 9-1-1 calls,\ndispatch initiated responses by Santa Barbara County Fire and American Medical Response for\nmedical assistance and requests to the UCSB PD, California Highway Patrol, State Park Rangers\nand Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s units from outside the Isla Vista area. Dispatch continued to relay information to law\nenforcement personnel in and responding to the Isla Vista area as more 9-1-1 calls were received.\nSheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies advised dispatch that the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle crashed at 21:35:30. Within eight\nshort minutes, three additional young victims had lost their lives, fourteen people were injured,\nfour sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies were involved in shooting situations and the suspect had killed himself.\nInvestigative Summary\nSince May 23, 2014, the Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office has worked with many other law enforcement agencies\nin the investigation of this incident. This group includes local, state and federal agencies, all of\nwhich assisted in one way or another with this complex effort. Thousands of hours went into this\ninvestigation and are reflected in a voluminous amount of investigative materials.\nThe first sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detectives arrived on scene at 2245 hours. Detective Schmidt from the Sheriff's\nOffice was assigned as the lead investigator and to work with Detective Aherns from the Santa\nBarbara Police Department (SBPD). Detective Aherns had spoken earlier with the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nparents. Chin Rodger, the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, told him she had been advised by Gavin Linderman,\nthe suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life coach, about both the manifesto and several ominous YouTube videos posted by\nthe suspect.\nSheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detectives identified the deceased suspect as Elliot Oliver Robertson Rodger, age 22.\nThey spoke with both of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents, Peter and Chin Rodger, by telephone. The parents\nwere in the process of driving to Santa Barbara from Los Angeles. Both were worried about their\nson based on the manifesto that had been emailed earlier that evening, but they both found it very\ndifficult to believe that their son either owned weapons or would actually hurt anyone.\nAt 2300 hours Detective Schmidt requested a protective sweep of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s residence for the\npurpose of checking the welfare of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roommates. The Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Special Enforcement\nTeam (SET) was assembled, formulated an entry plan, and at 0020 hours entered the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nresidence at 6598 Seville Road #7. Inside they found the bodies of three victims who had been\nbrutally murdered. Two of the deceased were later determined to be the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roommates and\nthe third person was one of their friends.\nAt 0100 hours, sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detectives met with Peter and Chin Rodger at a nearby parking lot. They\nadvised them that their son was dead and described some of the circumstances surrounding his\ndeath. The parents were obviously distraught, but very cooperative with the detectives. Over the\ncourse of the investigation they would provide a great deal of valuable information concerning the\nsuspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life prior to this tragedy.\nPage | 3\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nDuring the next few days all of the crime scenes were processed, including the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment\nat 6598 Seville Road. All of the survivors, victims, witnesses and officers involved in this incident\nwere interviewed. Search warrants were served at the homes of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents by members\nof the Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Criminal Investigations Division (CID) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nFirearms and Explosives (BATFE).\nThe subsequent investigation produced nearly 250 investigative documents. Five search warrants\nwere served covering five e-mail accounts belonging to the suspect. Additionally, warrants were\nserved for the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s YouTube account, Facebook page and his cell phone. Warrants were also\nserved for cell phone records belonging to the homicide victims found in the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment.\nThe Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s High Tech Crimes Unit analyzed the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone and laptop computer. The\nFederal Bureau of Investigation provided invaluable assistance in obtaining background\ninformation on the suspect, including records pertaining to his finances, academic performance\nand mental health. The BATFE investigated the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weapons purchases.\nSheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detectives were able to construct a timeline of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions on the evening of the\nmurders, as well as his actions during the days and weeks prior to May 23rd. To do this, they\nutilized numerous reports, surveillance footage, pictures, cell phone videos, search warrant returns\nand dispatch audio files.\nIn a parallel investigation, the Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coroner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Unit examined the circumstances surrounding\nthe victims who died and made findings as to the causes and manner of deaths resulting from this\nincident. Those findings are described in the main body of the report.\nAs with any significant investigation, the investigators involved in this case received a large\nnumber of leads after the date of the incident suggesting that other persons could have been\ninvolved as co-conspirators, or had additional information regarding the suspect or the crimes he\ncommitted. Each lead was evaluated and follow-up inquiries were conducted, either locally or\nthrough the efforts of other law enforcement agencies to substantiate or invalidate each lead.\nUltimately, none of this information yielded evidence of involvement by additional suspects.\nThe suspect had been in possession of numerous weapons. Three semi-automatic 9mm pistols were\nfound in the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle, along with the two knives used in the apartment murders. Several\nother knives and a small sledge hammer were found in the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bedroom. All of the firearms\nwere legally purchased by the suspect at commercial gun shops. Additionally, a large quantity of\n9mm ammunition that had been purchased by the suspect was found inside his vehicle.\nInquiry into the background, prior conduct, and motivation of the suspect was a major focus of the\ninvestigation. The investigation revealed that the suspect had several prior interactions with the\nSheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office. The most significant of these occurred on April 30, 2014, when a welfare check\nwas conducted by members of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol. The suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother initiated the welfare\ncheck through the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life coach, who in turn contacted Santa Barbara County Mental Health.\nThe request was based on disturbing videos that the suspect had posted on YouTube.\nPage | 4\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nDuring this welfare check the suspect did not show any signs of being, or make any statements\nindicating that he was, a danger to himself or others. In retrospect, this was one of several examples\nof the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to present a normal affect when interacting with others. He told the deputies\nthat his mother was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worry wart\u00e2\u20ac and explained that he had made the videos as a way to express\nhimself because he was lonely and did not have any friends.\nDuring this call a sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy contacted the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother by phone. She said that the videos\nmade it seem like the suspect was very lonely and was having a difficult time in Santa Barbara,\nthus validating the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements to the deputies. The suspect was calm, shy, and polite\nduring the April 30th encounter. The deputies allowed the suspect to speak with his mother in their\npresence. At the conclusion of the interview, the deputies felt that the suspect did not meet the\ncriteria of California Welfare & Institutions Code \u00c2\u00a75150(a) that would have allowed them to\ninvoluntarily take the suspect into custody for a period of up to 72 hours for a mental health\nassessment, or that cause existed to take any further investigatory actions.\nThe murder investigation disclosed that the suspect had been treated for many years for mental\nhealth issues. Those issues affected his ability to live a normal life and to interact well with others,\neven those to whom he should have been close. As an adult he did not effectively deal with those\nissues or even recognize them, quickly blaming others for his problems. This was especially true\nin his interactions with women. In retrospect, the contribution this made to the actions of May\n23rd was extremely significant; however, those mental health professionals who saw and treated\nhim did not see anything that would have predicted his future behavior. The suspect did not grow\nup around firearms and his parents were shocked to learn that he owned firearms since he had\nnever shown any previous interest in guns.\nThrough his manifesto and journal the suspect referred to his difficulty in interacting with women,\nalong with references to slicing throats and using his apartment as a torture chamber. The suspect\nhad a strong interest in certain violent video games, movies and books. Additionally, there was\nextensive discussion of cutting, bludgeoning and slashing within the manifesto and through\nphysical evidence at the apartment.\nUpon review of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internet search history investigators have learned that the suspect\nwas very interested in some of the practices and techniques of the Third Reich. The suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in-\ndepth research included information about Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler, two infamous\nmembers of the Nazi hierarchy. Himmler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s date of death was May 23rd; however, this fact appears\nto be purely coincidental. In actuality, the suspect made specific mention of planning the rampage\non a much earlier date, during the annual Deltopia event, but decided against it due to the increased\npolice presence in Isla Vista.\nIt is the conclusion of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office that the suspect acted alone on\nMay 23, 2014 and that he was solely responsible for his criminal actions that day. The available\nevidence indicates that no other person conspired with the suspect to commit these crimes, nor\naided or abetted him in any way. In the course of this rampage the suspect committed a number of\ncrimes in violation of the California Penal Code. These crimes included six counts of Murder,\nPage | 5\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nthree counts of Murder under Special Circumstances \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lying in Wait, twenty counts of Attempted\nMurder and multiple lesser offenses.\nThe obvious question that remains is: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why did the suspect murder six people and attempt to\nmurder 14 others?\u00e2\u20ac Unfortunately, that question may never be answered conclusively, despite the\ncollection of extensive background information on the suspect through a multitude of interviews\nand from other sources. His initial rampage was directed at his roommates and one of their friends,\nand he then attempted to target a sorority. When that attempt failed, he began randomly targeting\nvictims who just happened to be in the area.\nIt is hoped that a thorough review of these materials by both law enforcement and mental health\nprofessionals will lead to the development of some new techniques and practices in identifying\nand treating such troubled persons.\nPage | 6\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE OF REPORT The Office of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff-Coroner (Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office) was responsible for the\ninvestigation of the mass murder that occurred in Isla Vista2 on May 23, 2014. The Santa Barbara\nCounty Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office and Coroner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office are aligned as one agency. The criminal\ninvestigation and death investigation of all decedents was handled by Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personnel (criminal\ninvestigations detectives and coroner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detectives). Throughout this investigation, local, state and\nfederal law enforcement agencies assisted the Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office.\nThis case presented many challenges for all involved in the investigation. In a matter of hours, the\nsuspect murdered six victims and injured an additional fourteen.3 The suspect used a variety of\nweapons on his victims as he moved through this densely populated college town. The suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\ncrimes were committed at 17 different locations. The suspect intentionally shot at responding\ndeputies which resulted in two deputy-involved shootings.4\nThe suspect attempted to kill and injure numerous victims (civilian and law enforcement), and the\ntotal amount of victims who narrowly escaped injury and death will never be known. What we do\nknow is that the suspect intended on killing as many people as possible when he set his plan in\nmotion on May 23, 2014.\nThe suspect wrote a 137-page autobiographical manifesto documenting his life and reasons for\nplanning a mass murder, which he emailed shortly before he began his final rampage.5 A\nsignificant portion of this investigation involved detectives seeking to corroborate this information\nthrough interviews and an exhaustive investigation into the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s background and internet\nprofile/activity.\nPREFACE\nThis report will serve as a summary of the Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office response to, and investigation of, the\nmass murder in Isla Vista on May 23, 2014.\n2 Isla Vista, CA is a densely populated, unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County west of the University of\nCalifornia, Santa Barbara (UCSB) main campus. Isla Vista is home to thousands of college students who attend UCSB\nand Santa Barbara City College (SBCC). It is bordered by UCSB, the City of Goleta and the Pacific Ocean. Isla Vista\ncovers .533 miles. The 2010 Census recorded 23,096 residents. 3 These crimes were separated into two events on 5-23-14; the stabbing deaths of three victims at the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\napartment, and the subsequent shooting and vehicular attacks against numerous victims throughout Isla Vista. There\nwas an approximate three hour gap between the end of the first event and the beginning of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rampage\nthroughout Isla Vista. 4 There were two separate deputy involved shootings; the first involving one sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy and, minutes later, the\nsecond involving three sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies who fired at the suspect. These shootings occurred at two locations in Isla\nVista. 5 Thirty-four email addresses are listed as recipients. These recipients include the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents, friends,\nacquaintances, professors, medical and mental health providers. The suspect emailed this document on 5-23-14 at\n9:18:43 PM Pacific Standard Time.\nPage | 7\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nOn Friday, May 23, 2014, Elliot Oliver Robertson Rodger6 committed a mass murder in Isla Vista,\nan unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County located west of the University of California, Santa\nBarbara (UCSB) campus. The initial law enforcement response was by sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies and\nuniversity police officers assigned to the Isla Vista Foot Patrol (IVFP). IVFP is a joint policing\nunit comprised of sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies and police officers from the University of California, Santa\nBarbara Police Department (UCSB PD).\nThe suspect was a 22-year-old Santa Barbara City College student living in Isla Vista.

Gibson said people often knock on the door, but on this\noccasion, the knocking was more aggressive than usual. Gibson estimated the knocking occurred\nfor approximately three minutes. Approximately 30 seconds after the knocking stopped, Gibson\nheard five gunshots, followed by a female screaming. After the screaming, Gibson heard \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe\nfour more\u00e2\u20ac gunshots. Gibson looked out her window and observed someone doing CPR on a\nfemale outside (on the west side of the Alpha Phi sorority house).\nAt about 2130 hours, Linda Gordon, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153house mother\u00e2\u20ac for the Alpha Phi sorority, heard several\nloud gunshots outside the building.11 Gordon heard approximately 12 gunshots, with some pauses\nin between the volleys of gunfire.

Cherchian, who had also been traveling eastbound on Sabado Tarde, was about\nfive to six feet in front of Smith.\nSmith heard approximately five to ten gunshots. He was struck in the groin area and left inner\nthigh. Cherchian was also shot numerous times. The suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pistol remained inside the vehicle\nas he fired. Smith was able to see the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face because it was illuminated by the muzzle\nflash every time he fired. Smith estimated the suspect was stopped for approximately five seconds.\nSmith immediately took cover behind parked cars. He ran past three residences to the west so he\ncould take refuge at his friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house at 6595 Sabado Tarde. Once inside, two of the residents,\nDarby and Jordan, assisted him with his injuries and called 9-1-1. While waiting for paramedics,\nSmith called his friend, David Campbell, and told him what happened and where he was located.\nCampbell ran to 6595 Sabado Tarde, and while en route, Campbell grabbed a sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy\n(Deputy Rushing) and told him that Smith had been shot and was waiting for help at 6595 Sabado\nTarde.\nCampbell and the deputy arrived, and the deputy applied a bandage to Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s injuries until\nparamedics arrived and transported Smith to the hospital. While at the hospital, Smith identified\nthe suspect when Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Detective Kouremetis showed him an image from the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retribution\u00e2\u20ac YouTube video.\nDeputy Rushing came to Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aid with Campbell. This is based on Deputy Rushing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radio\ntraffic at 21:41:18 and 21:42:22.63 During these transmissions, Deputy Rushing advised he was\nwith a gunshot victim at 6595 Sabado Tarde. During the later transmission, Deputy Rushing told\ndispatch that the victim was bleeding heavily and he requested a medical kit. Deputy Rushing\nconfirmed his location as 6595 Sabado Tarde during both transmissions.\nDeputy Rushing arrived in Isla Vista and parked near the terminus at 6594 Del Playa. Upon arrival,\nhe was tasked with providing assistance to other victims. Deputy Rushing grabbed his gunshot\ntrauma kit from his patrol car and went to Sabado Tarde.64 He was approached by an unidentified\nmale who requested assistance with his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brother\u00e2\u20ac who had been shot. Deputy Rushing was led to\nMatthew Smith who was lying in the front yard of 6595 Sabado Tarde. Deputy Rushing escorted\nSmith into 6595 Sabado Tarde and provided medical aid until paramedics arrived.\nAt about 2100 hours, Antoine Cherchian and his friend, Alexander Kurdian, went to a party on the\n6700 block of Del Playa.65 They stayed at the party for about 30 minutes and left on their\nskateboards. Cherchian and Kurdian rode their skateboards eastbound on Del Playa, northbound\non Camino Del Sur and eastbound onto the 6600 block of Sabado Tarde. Cherchian and Kurdian\nwere traveling eastbound on the south side of Sabado Tarde; Kurdian was slightly ahead of\nCherchian.\nCherchian looked back and to his left and saw a black BMW with a broken front windshield. The\nvehicle quickly pulled alongside Cherchian and then slowed.

The passenger-side of the BMW was facing\nCherchian. Cherchian saw a \"silver-colored\" pistol within the vehicle and heard four gunshots.\nThe gun remained inside the vehicle when the shots were fired. Cherchian described the sound as\n\"bam, bam, bam, bam.\" Cherchian indicated that the gunshots were not very loud. Initially, he\nbelieved the noises were from a \"cap gun.\" Cherchian didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face.\nAfter the gunshots, the driver of the vehicle sped eastbound on Sabado Tarde. Cherchian thought\nKurdian jumped off his skateboard and ran behind parked vehicles to get away from the gunfire.\nWithin five seconds, Cherchian noticed his arm was \"gushing blood.\" Cherchian collapsed on the\nstreet after noticing his injury. After the vehicle left, Kurdian ran over and removed his belt.\nKurdian used his belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding from Cherchian's arm. Kurdian dragged\nCherchian up a driveway and requested assistance from bystanders. Cherchian believed there were\napproximately six individuals applying pressure to his gunshot wounds. Shortly thereafter, a\nsheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy arrived and radioed in that shots had been fired. Cherchian described this portion\nof his memory as \"hazy\" because he was going into \"shock.\"\nInitially, Cherchian didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he had been shot because he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel any pain. Approximately\n15 minutes later, an ambulance arrived and transported Cherchian to Santa Barbara Cottage\nHospital. Cherchian was shot four times. He had gunshot wounds to his left forearm, upper left\nchest, under his left arm, lower abdomen and lower back. One of the bullets ruptured his liver.\nAlexander Kurdian was riding his skateboard with Antoine Cherchian when Cherchian was shot.66\nThey were skateboarding eastbound on Sabado Tarde toward El Embarcadero when he heard four\nto five \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pops\u00e2\u20ac that sounded like they were behind him. Kurdian was in front of Cherchian when\nhe looked back and saw a vehicle approaching that had major damage to its windshield. The\ndamage to the windshield was consistent with a pedestrian collision. The top of the windshield\nwas \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hanging off\u00e2\u20ac and looked as if someone had kicked it in. Kurdian estimated the vehicle was\nabout six feet behind him when he first noticed it.\nKurdian jumped off his skateboard and hid behind a red Prius. He heard two to three additional\ngunshots as he was hiding behind the car. He came out from hiding and saw a bullet hole in the\ncar he was hiding behind, leading him to believe that the suspect also shot at him. After hearing\nthe shots, the vehicle continued eastbound on Sabado Tarde. Kurdian never saw the driver or any\npassengers in the vehicle. Kurdian heard additional gunfire after the vehicle left this area. After\nthe vehicle left, Kurdian saw Cherchian on the ground with gunshot wounds. Kurdian rendered\naid to Cherchian and remained with him until paramedics arrived.\nCherchian was likely shot near 6573 Sabado Tarde. This is based on victim Matthew Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nrecollection of being shot at this location with Cherchian.\nAt 21:33:28 hours,67 Sergeant Welch advised dispatch of a gunshot victim in front of 7-Eleven\n(6545 Trigo Road).

Carter was\nable to hear the deputies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 radio traffic which included a description of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle being\na brand new BMW 3 series. Carter never saw the BMW because he was trying to protect himself\nby hiding under the seat. Carter heard the deputies talking about the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle, and they\nsounded confident that they were shooting at the suspect.\nOfficer Oldread and UCSB PD Corporal Lupo responded to the area of Pizza My Heart.70 They\nparked their patrol vehicle and continued on foot after observing several shell casings on the\nroadway. They approached Little Acorn Park and learned that someone at 7-Eleven had been shot.\nOfficer Oldread and Corporal Lupo began yelling at numerous bystanders to get inside the 7-\nEleven and lock the door. At this time, Officer Oldread heard an unknown deputy yell that the\nsuspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle was returning.\nOfficer Oldread saw the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle, a newer model, black-colored BMW.

It was determined that he suffered a heart attack while at\nIVFP.\nINVESTIGATIVE NARRATIVE89\nAt approximately 2245 hours, Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CID Detective Sergeant Sanders held a briefing and began\nassigning tasks to sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detectives.90 I, Detective Schmidt, was assigned to contact Santa\nBarbara Police Detective Aherns, who had been speaking with the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, Chin Rodger.\nAt 2238 hours, SBPD Detective Ahrens spoke with the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, Chin Rodger,91 on the\nphone. Detective Ahrens learned from Chin that her son, the suspect, was a student at Santa\nBarbara City College. She was concerned for his welfare after being contacted by Gavin\nLinderman, the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life skills coach.92 Linderman received an emailed manifesto (\"My\nTwisted World,\" sent on 5-23-14 at 21:18:43 hours) from the suspect regarding his desire to carry\nout a violent attack. Chin also heard about the recent shooting in Isla Vista and was concerned\nthat her son, the suspect, might have some involvement.\nAt about 2250 hours, I spoke with SBPD Detective Ahrens. Detective Ahrens provided the\nsuspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address as 6598 Seville Road #7 in Isla Vista. Detective Ahrens learned that the suspect\nhad a YouTube account which contained several videos he created. One of these videos was titled,\n\"Retribution,\" wherein the suspect talked about his plan to carry out revenge by killing numerous\npeople.93 Detective Ahrens said the suspect wrote about using his apartment (6598 Seville Road.\n#7) as a location where he would murder people.\nBased on the suspect's emailed manifesto, YouTube videos and information obtained from SBPD\nDetective Aherns, I requested a check of the roommates\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 welfare at the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment.\nAt approximately 2300 hours, I contacted Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s SET member Senior Deputy Gotschall. Senior\nDeputy Gotschall was staged on Trigo Road in front of the Isla Vista Foot Patrol station with\nseveral other SET members. I told him that 6598 Seville Road #7 was likely the suspect's\nresidence, and to prepare for an exigent protective sweep to check the welfare of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nroommates.\n89 The Investigative Narrative is written in the first person by Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Detective Joe Schmidt. 90 SBSO case 14-7595, supplement 0002 91 Chin and Peter Rodger are the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents. Throughout the remainder of this document they will be referred\nto by their first names. 92 SBSO case 14-7595, supplement 0092.

I requested Detective Morris attempt to\nidentify the suspect, who I believed was Elliot Rodger.\nDetective Morris printed a DMV driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license picture of the suspect and went to 6594 Del Playa\nwith Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Detective R. Vasquez.94 The suspect was lying in the roadway and was covered\nwith a yellow blanket. Detective Morris removed the blanket from the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face and\nattempted to compare the face to the DMV picture of the suspect. Initially, Detective Morris was\nonly able to determine that the suspect was an Asian male. He subsequently located a wallet in\nthe suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front right pocket. The wallet contained a California driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license for Elliot\nRodger. Detective Morris notified me of his findings. Based on the totality of circumstances, it\nwas determined that the suspect was Elliot Oliver Robertson Rodger (DOB: 7-24-91).\nAt 2303 hours, I spoke with Chin Rodger on her cell phone while she was driving to Santa Barbara.\nChin identified herself as the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother. She said the suspect had \"social issues\" and saw\na therapist. The suspect told her that his last day of school was May 23, 2014, and he would be\ntaking a test at SBCC. The suspect told Chin he would call her when he finished his test. The\nsuspect never called her. Chin tried to call the suspect, but he didn't answer. She also texted him,\nbut he still didn't call back.\nChin reported that on that same day, at 2225 hours, she received a call from Gavin Linderman.\nLinderman was concerned about the suspect forwarding his emailed manifesto, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My Twisted\nWorld,\u00e2\u20ac to him and numerous other people. Chin and Linderman also discovered a concerning\nYouTube video the suspect posted. Chin called her ex-husband, Peter Rodger (the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nfather). I learned they were driving from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara in separate vehicles so they\ncould check on the suspect. Chin also mentioned less concerning YouTube videos that the suspect\nposted about one month previous.\nChin was not aware of the suspect owning any firearms. She sounded incredulous when I asked\nher this question. Chin said the suspect lived with two housemates who resided in a separate room.\nShe didn't know their names. Chin confirmed that the suspect drove a black two-door BMW 328i,\nwhich was registered to her.\nAt 2332 hours, I called Peter Rodger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone and his wife, Soumaya Akaaboune, answered.\nSoumaya identified herself as the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stepmother. She and Peter were driving to Santa\nBarbara, and had previously spoken with SBPD Detective Ahrens. Peter said Chin called him that\nevening after she learned of the suspect sending some \"worrisome emails.\" Peter described the\nsuspect as being very lonely, with no friends and no girlfriend. The suspect sent an email with an\napproximate 100-page attachment that talked about taking retribution. The suspect sent this email\nto numerous people. Peter looked at this email and said it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freaked him out.\u00e2\u20ac He subsequently\nheard about something going on in Isla Vista and this worried him.\n94 SBSO case 14-7595, supplement 0038\nPage | 31\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nPeter didn't know the names of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roommates, but he mentioned that the suspect had\npreviously made a law enforcement complaint against one of them for stealing. Peter didn't know\nif the suspect owned any firearms or weapons. He described the suspect as being very non-violent.\nI finished my conversation with Peter and conducted a Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s records check on the suspect. I\nlearned that the suspect made a report on 1-15-14 against his housemate, Cheng Yuan Hong,\nalleging the theft of candles.95 Hong was subsequently booked into Santa Barbara County Jail for\n488 PC (Petty Theft) after being placed under citizen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest by the suspect.\nAt 2349 hours, I called Hong's cell phone and received a voicemail message. I contacted SET,\nwhich was preparing to deploy to 6598 Seville Road #7. I told Senior Deputy Gotschall that I\ncalled Hong, the suspect's housemate, but he didn't answer his cell phone.\nAs additional SET members arrived in Isla Vista, a tactical plan was developed in order to safely\nconduct the protective sweep of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment. There was concern that the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\napartment was rigged with booby traps or other unknown hazards that could have endangered\nneighbors and law enforcement personnel. The potential for hazardous conditions at the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\napartment was learned by detectives who were assigned to read the manifesto.96\nAt 00:20:45 hours, the following morning,97 SET arrived at 6598 Seville Road #7 to conduct the\nprotective sweep. The entry team consisted of Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Senior Deputy Gotschall, Detective\nYeates, Sergeant Perkins, Senior Deputy Jones, Senior Deputy McSkimming, Detective Gonzales\nand Paramedic Lux.98 The front door to #7 was locked. An interior light illuminated a room inside\nthe apartment, and a window screen was removed so the window leading to this room could be\nopened.\nSenior Deputy Gotschall was able to open the window and look inside. He discovered it was a\nbathroom and he immediately observed a deceased male (George Chen) on the floor surrounded\nby a large amount of blood. Due to these findings, the front door to the apartment was manually\nbreached at 00:24:29 hours by Senior Deputy McSkimming.99\nSET members conducted a protective sweep of the interior and found a second and third victim\ninside a bedroom on the northwest corner of the apartment. Both victims, Weihan Wang and\nCheng Hong, were lying on the blood-soaked bedroom floor and were covered by blankets and\nclothing. The victims showed no signs of life and were declared dead by SET members.\nAt 00:38:18 hours,100 SET completed the protective sweep of 6598 Seville Road #7. George Chen,\nWeihan Wang and Cheng Hong were the last of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victims to be discovered.\n95 SBSO case 14-693 96 The suspect wrote that he was going to use his apartment as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal torture and killing chamber.\u00e2\u20ac He\ndescribed that he would lure people into his apartment, knock them out with a hammer, slit their throats and behead\nthem once they died \u00e2\u20ac\u201c page 132 of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My Twisted World.\u00e2\u20ac 97 SBSO Frequency 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Time of broadcast by SET Sgt.

The apartment was secured while a search warrant was\ncompleted by Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Detective Fenske.\nFor the next several hours, Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personnel, with the assistance of outside agencies, processed\nnumerous crime scenes, interviewed victims and witnesses, and canvassed residential areas\nthroughout Isla Vista.\nAt 0102 hours, Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Detective Scherbarth and I contacted Peter and Chin Rodger in the parking\nlot of the Goleta Home Depot.101 They had arrived from Los Angeles and were waiting for the\nstatus of the suspect. They believed he had some involvement in the mass murder, but were\nunaware to what extent. I notified Peter and Chin that the suspect was dead.\nPeter and Chin, who were accompanied by friends, were very distraught and unable to provide\ninformation on the suspect. However, they both agreed to meet with detectives at a later time in\norder to provide additional information concerning the suspect.\nRECOVERED WEAPONS AND CARTRIDGE CASES FIRED BY THE SUSPECT\nA total of fifty-five 9mm expended cartridge cases were recovered from the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle and\nthe various crime scenes throughout Isla Vista. Although the exact number of rounds fired by the\nsuspect is unknown, the number of 55 expended cartridge cases is consistent with the capacity of\nthe empty Sig Sauer magazines recovered from the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle.\nAll of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pistol magazines held a maximum of ten rounds. Six empty magazines were\nrecovered from the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle. A Sig Sauer semi-automatic 9mm pistol was found on the\ndriver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seat next to the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right hip. This pistol had one live round in its chamber and a\nmagazine containing seven rounds of ammunition inserted into the magazine well. This pistol was\nfound and seized by Deputy Marquez.\nA total of 548 live rounds of 9mm ammunition were found in the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possession. Three\nhundred twenty-one rounds of this ammunition were loaded into magazines. There were 197\nrounds inside ammunition boxes on the front passenger floorboard. Two loose rounds of\nammunition were found underneath the driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s floor mat.\nA second Sig Sauer semi-automatic 9mm pistol was found on the front passenger floorboard of\nthe suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle. This firearm contained a magazine loaded with nine rounds of ammunition.\nOne round was chambered in this firearm.\nA Glock semi-automatic 9mm pistol containing a magazine loaded with ten rounds of ammunition\nwas found inside a bag on the front passenger floorboard of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle.\n101 SBSO case 14-7595, supplement 0002\nPage | 33\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nThe Cold Steel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boar Hunter\u00e2\u20ac and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SRK\u00e2\u20ac knives were located inside a backpack found on the\npassenger floorboard of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle. Subsequent forensic investigation confirmed these\nwere the weapons used in the murders at the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment.\n6598 SEVILLE ROAD #7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c SCENE INVESTIGATION\nOn the morning of May 24, 2014, a search warrant was served on the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment; 6598\nSeville Road #7. The apartment was processed by Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Forensics detectives and crime scene\ntechnicians.\nBased on forensic evidence discovered at the scene, it was determined that Weihan Wang, Cheng\nHong and George Chen were all murdered inside 6598 Seville Road #7. The suspect used two\nfixed-blade knives to inflict numerous sharp force injuries upon each victim.\n6598 Seville Road #7 is a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a small kitchen and living\narea. This apartment is located on the ground floor of a two-story, multi-unit residential building\nreferred to as the Capri Apartments. The suspect had his own bedroom, which was closest to the\nfront door. Cheng Hong and Weihan Wang shared the other bedroom, located on the opposite end\nof the apartment, across the hallway from the bathroom. George Chen was visiting the apartment\nwhen he was murdered.\nThe main hallway walls of the apartment had faint, red-colored smears that were consistent with\nblood being cleaned from these surfaces. It is possible that some of the victims were initially\nattacked in the hallway upon entering the apartment. A large, white-colored bath towel containing\nsmeared blood, and several blood-soaked paper towels were found inside the bathroom. These\nblood-stained items were consistent with someone attempting to clean blood from various surfaces.\nWeihan Wang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body was found lying face down on the floor, deep inside his bedroom and furthest\nfrom the bedroom door. Wang was wearing a T-shirt and athletic pants. Wang was barefoot and\nhe had very little blood on the soles of his feet. His body was partially covered by a blanket, towel\nand clothing, as if the suspect had attempted to conceal him from the view of anyone entering the\nbedroom.\nCheng Hong was found lying face down on the floor inside his bedroom. He was next to Wang,\nbut closest to the door of their shared bedroom. Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right foot was on top of Wang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower\nback, indicating that Wang was already down when Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body came to rest on the bedroom\nfloor. Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right pant leg had been pulled up to his knee, which is consistent with a body being\ndragged.\nHong was most likely the second victim to be murdered by the suspect. Hong was wearing\nsneakers and a backpack, as if he had just returned from class. The soles of Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sneakers were\ncovered in blood. Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body was also partially covered by blankets. Hong was likely ambushed\nby the suspect upon entering the apartment through the front door, or upon entering his bedroom.\nPage | 34\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nHong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body was possibly dragged to the location where his body was found, in his bedroom, and\nintentionally positioned next to Wang.\nHong was wearing a blue T-shirt, athletic pants, socks and Nike sneakers. The soles and sides of\nHong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sneakers contained a large amount of blood. A backpack was found next to Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head.\nHis arms were still through the straps of the backpack. The positioning of Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backpack in\nrelation to his body was consistent with him falling to the floor while still wearing the backpack.\nThe positioning of his body was also consistent with him being dragged.\nGeorge Chen was found in the bathroom, lying on the floor on his right side. His body was in the\nfetal position and his back was facing the open bathroom doorway. A damp, white-colored bath\ntowel had been placed on Chen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back. The towel was smeared with blood. Several bloody paper\ntowels were strewn around the bathroom floor near Chen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body. Chen was barefoot and a large\namount of dried blood covered the soles of his feet. Sandals were located underneath Chen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body.\nGeorge Chen was likely the last victim who was murdered inside 6598 Seville Road #7. Vincent\nChang is the last known person to see George Chen alive. Chang lived with Chen and another\nroommate at the UCSB Manzanita Village dorms. Chang last saw Chen on May 23, 2014 at about\n1745 hours.102 Chen left their dorm at this time and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say where he was going or what he was\ngoing to do. It was typical of Chen to leave and not talk about his plans.103\nChang said it was common for Chen to leave the dorm on a Friday night and return during the\nearly morning hours. Chen was quiet and he kept to himself. He majored in Computer Science\nand played video games often. Chang didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know any of Chen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends.\nIt is unknown exactly when Chen arrived at 6598 Seville Road #7. Chen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body was found on the\nbathroom floor. The bathroom is located at the end of the hallway, directly opposite from Wang\nand Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bedroom. It is probable that Chen was attacked upon entering the apartment, or when\nhe approached Wang and Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bedroom where their bodies were located.\nBased on the evidence at the scene, it is probable that the suspect murdered Wang, Hong and Chen\nseparately, and in this order. Due to Wang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body being found deep inside the bedroom, the\nsuspect likely ambushed Wang while he was alone inside the bedroom. Wang was partially\ncovered with blankets and clothing, which would have concealed his body from view upon\nsomeone entering the bedroom.\nFew details of these victims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 activities on May 23, 2014, prior to their deaths, are known. Search\nwarrants were submitted on their cell phone providers in order to discover their call and text\nmessage history prior to their deaths.\nWeihan Wang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last cell phone call, where a conversation took place, occurred on May 23, 2014,\nat 0136 hours.

This outbound call\nto Weihan Wang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone lasted one minute and ten seconds. On the same day, between 1444\nhours and 1504 hours, Chen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone called Wang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone, but these calls were not\nanswered. Chen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone had no text message history for May 23, 2014.\nThe murders of Wang, Hong and Chen are consistent with the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manifesto. The suspect\nwrote about his plan to lure victims into his apartment, which he would use as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153torture and killing\nchamber.\u00e2\u20ac105\nITEMS RECOVERED FROM THE SUSPECT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S BEDROOM\nThe suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment (6598 Seville Road #7) and bedroom were searched and photo-\ndocumented pursuant to a search warrant.\nThe suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bedroom was in a state of disarray. The room was cluttered with numerous items\nstrewn on the floor. A laptop computer was on top of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed. The screen was flipped\nopen and turned on, displaying a YouTube page acknowledging that a video had just been\nuploaded. A screen shot from the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Retribution\u00e2\u20ac video was visible on this YouTube page,\nwhich was illuminated on the laptop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s screen.\nThe fitted sheet on the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed had numerous slash and stab marks on the corner. Several\nareas of this blue-colored fitted sheet contained dried blood consistent with drops and smears.\nSeveral pillows on the bed also had numerous stab marks in the pillow cases. The presence of this\ndamage suggests that the suspect may have been practicing his stabbing/slashing movements in\norder to rehearse and prepare himself for the attacks against his victims.\nA long-sleeve, button-up shirt and denim pants were found on the bed, entangled in the sheets and\nbedspread. A significant amount of dried blood was present on the sleeves and front, torso-area\nof this shirt. The majority of this blood was confined to the ends of the shirt sleeves, near the cuffs.\nThe denim pants also had a significant amount of dried blood concentrated on the front of the pant\nlegs.

That is all I have to say on here.\nGoodbye.\nINVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE ACCESSORIES/CO-CONSPIRATORS\nA significant focus of this investigation was to determine if anyone conspired with and/or aided\nthe suspect in any way to facilitate this tragedy. The suspect was able to cover a significant amount\nof terrain while he sought to kill and injure as many people as he could. The suspect accomplished\nthis by remaining in his vehicle, driving recklessly throughout the narrow and pedestrian-filled\nstreets of Isla Vista. This inevitably created a chaotic scene as sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies and police officers\nrapidly mobilized (mostly on foot) in order to find the suspect and stop him from causing additional\nharm. Law enforcement personnel were challenged with obtaining a description of the suspect\nwhile simultaneously discovering additional crime scenes and treating the dead and wounded.\n123 On 8-4-09, George Sodini shot and killed three females inside a women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aerobics class at LA Fitness in Collier\nTownship, Pennsylvania. He injured nine additional victims before committing suicide.\nPage | 41\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nThe convoluted nature of this rapidly unfolding massacre, and the nature in which it quickly ended,\ninitially led law enforcement to believe that there were two suspects. This confusion was primarily\nbased on the proximity of Keith Cheung to the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle once it had crashed.\nAt the end of the pursuit, Keith Cheung was handcuffed because deputies thought he was possibly\na second suspect. Cheung matched one of the suspect descriptions that was previously provided\n(Asian male, white T-shirt). Cheung\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proximity to the rear passenger side of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle\nled responding deputies to believe that he was involved. It was quickly determined that Cheung\nwas a victim who was riding his bicycle when he was intentionally struck by the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle.\nHe was provided with medical attention and released from handcuffs.\nThe ensuing investigation by detectives sought to determine if there was anyone who conspired\nwith, or assisted the suspect the planning phase before May 23, 2014. To accomplish this, search\nwarrants were written for the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cell phone, email accounts, YouTube, social media profiles\nand Internet blogs on which he participated.124 Detectives also reviewed numerous internet\npostings made by the suspect where he wrote about his frustration in not being able to meet women.\nThe suspect was actively involved in communicating with others via the Internet. The suspect\nmostly ranted about his frustrations with women. He often wrote about his confusion as to why\nwomen weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attracted to him. These rants caused people to respond with mixed emotions; some\nresponded with negative, angry comments, while others offered to help the suspect by providing\nhim with advice on how to meet women. Other subjects voiced similar complaints and frustrations\nas the suspect.\nUpon reviewing the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internet communications, there is no evidence that indicates anyone\nelse conspired with and/or aided the suspect in committing the murders and attempted murders on\nMay 23, 2014.\nAll evidence suggests the suspect acted alone in the planning and execution of the crimes he\ncommitted on May 23, 2014.\nMISCELLANEOUS INVESTIGATIVE LEADS\nIn the days and weeks following May 23, 2014, the Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office received numerous calls\nreferencing this case. Some individuals wanted to report information regarding the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nactivities prior to the murders. Others reported potential \u00e2\u20ac\u0153copy cats\u00e2\u20ac that were making statements,\nvia the Internet or social media, that they were going to commit similar crimes.125 All leads were\ninvestigated and oftentimes required assistance from outside law enforcement agencies.\n124 The suspect wrote extensively on forums associated with the websites www.puahate.com, www.bodybuilding.com\nand www.imgur.com. Shortly after the 5-23-14 tragedy in Isla Vista, www.puahate.com (Pick Up Artist Hate) was\ntaken down. This website was used by involuntarily celibate men (self-proclaimed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incels\u00e2\u20ac) as a forum to\ncommiserate about their frustrations with women. 125 Information received by SBSO initiated investigations as far east as Waldoboro, Maine (SBSO case 14-9169)\nPage | 42\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nNoteworthy information was provided by a librarian who works at the Santa Barbara City College\nlibrary. The librarian reported that she assisted a person, matching the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s description, with\nlocating books on serial killers and mass murder. She helped this person on two separate\noccasions, with the last occasion being approximately two to three months prior to May 23,\n2014.126 The person she assisted only viewed the books in the library and did not check them out.\nEVENTS AND BACKGROUND LEADING UP TO MAY 23, 2014\nRecent Background Information\nPer the manifesto, the suspect moved to Isla Vista on June 4, 2011. He enrolled at Santa Barbara\nCity College and lived in various apartments with a variety of roommates who he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know\npreviously. His most current housemates, Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong, shared a bedroom at\n6598 Seville Road #7. The suspect had his own bedroom at this apartment. The suspect didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\nwant to be friends with Wang and Hong, and he described them as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dorks.\u00e2\u20ac\nThe suspect moved to Isla Vista in order to gain independence and improve his social skills with\npeers. The suspect struggled with social interactions throughout his adolescence. These difficulties\ncontinued after high school when he attended Pierce College and Moorpark College, while he still\nlived with his mother in Los Angeles.\nThe suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents, Peter and Chin Rodger, were devoted to helping him overcome his social\nanxiety. They facilitated the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visits with various mental health providers to help him with\nhis anxieties and social deficiencies. Peter and Chin often met with each other and discussed\ndifferent options for the suspect.\nChin came up with the idea for the suspect to move to Isla Vista. She mentioned this to Peter and\nthey sat down with the suspect and went over the plan. The suspect agreed to move to Isla Vista\nbecause it would be a fresh start. Isla Vista was close enough for the suspect to return home\nwithout having to travel very far, yet far enough to require him to be independent on a daily\nbasis.127\nDespite the move to Isla Vista, the suspect continued to have difficulty interacting with his peers.\nHe wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to make friends and was unable to approach females. This perpetuated his main\nfrustration in not being able to meet a girlfriend. The suspect became increasingly angry over his\nself-perceived rejection by females. His anger and frustration was exacerbated whenever he saw\na couple, especially if they were college-aged. One of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary difficulties was\nmeeting people and initiating conversation. He was especially upset that he remained a virgin.\n126 SBSO case 14-7595, supplement 0123 127 The suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s residence in Isla Vista was approximately 85 miles north of his parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 homes in Los Angeles.\nPage | 43\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nNoteworthy Journal Entries\nTwo handwritten journals were recovered from the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bedroom. The first journal had\nentries dated April 5, 2010 to March 16, 2011. The second journal had entries dated March 31,\n2011 to May 23, 2014. Several journal entries paralleled the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manifesto.\nThe suspect came to believe that the only way he would obtain a girlfriend and lose his virginity\nwas if he became wealthy. To achieve this goal, the suspect played the lottery in the hopes of\nwinning and becoming a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153young multi-millionaire.\u00e2\u20ac The suspect wrote the following about what\nhis life would be like if he won the lottery:128\nI will be able to fully indulge in everything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m passionate about: exotic cars, luxurious\nmansions, expensive clothes, and of course, sex with beautiful girls. I will drive a Maserati\nand a Lamborghini, and when girls see me in those cars they will all want to date me. They\nwill finally see me as the supreme man that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m meant to be. When I purchase a huge,\nbeautiful mansion and take girls to it, they will be in love. I just know it!\nOnce all this comes to fruition, I will finally lose my virginity. I will be able to have sex!\nSEX SEX SEX!!!\nThe suspect purchased lottery tickets on several occasions. He never won and this caused him to\nbecome more agitated. After the repeated losses, the suspect learned that the Powerball lottery\njackpot was in excess of 500 million dollars.

Due to his level of alcohol intoxication, the suspect mistakenly went to the wrong\nhouse and demanded his sunglasses be returned to him. The occupants of this house called the\nsuspect names and began kicking and punching him. The suspect eventually left this house and\nfled the area.\nThe suspect reported this matter to the Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office on July 21, 2013, while he was a patient in\nthe Goleta Valley Cottage hospital emergency room. In his manifesto, the suspect wrote \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had to\nconcoct a fairly altered story to explain to the police, who would inevitably have to interview me\nonce I got to the hospital and reported my injury.\u00e2\u20ac137 The suspect did not tell the reporting deputy\nthat he started the fight. The suspect downplayed his involvement as a primary aggressor. This\ncase was suspended by the Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office pending leads.\nArrest of Suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Roommate, Cheng Hong: January 15, 2014\nOn January 15, 2014, the suspect placed his housemate, Cheng Hong, under citizen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest for\nallegedly stealing three candles.138 The candles had an estimated value of $22.00.

The suspect asked Hong to\nreturn the candles, but Hong refused.\nThe suspect called 9-1-1 to report the theft of his candles. Isla Vista Foot Patrol deputies responded\nto 6598 Seville Road #7. Deputies spoke with Hong, who alleged that the suspect took his\n(Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) rice bowls and moved Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property around the apartment about one month\npreviously. The suspect denied these accusations.\nDeputies attempted to get Hong and the suspect to come to an agreement on their issues, but Hong\nrefused to cooperate. Deputies found the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candles on Hong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed. The candles were\nrecovered and identified by the suspect as his stolen property.

The staff member said she had been contacted by\nthe suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, Chin Rodger, who had viewed YouTube videos the suspect posted. Chin\nsaid the suspect appeared to be depressed in the videos. Chin had not heard from the suspect in\nfour days, and she was concerned for his well-being.\nWhile a check the welfare call would typically require only two law enforcement officials to\nrespond, in this case a group of six personnel responded to 6598 Seville Road #7. A group of four\nsheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputies and a sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dispatcher in training were walking together. A UCSB PD officer\nalso responded to 6598 Seville Road #7 after Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personnel arrived at the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment.\nDeputies responded to the apartment where the suspect was believed to be home alone. They\ninterviewed him and, as they are trained to do in routine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153check the welfare\u00e2\u20ac calls, they assessed\nthe situation. Deputies found the suspect to be shy, timid and polite.\nWhen deputies asked about the videos he was said to have posted, but which the deputies had not\nviewed, the suspect explained he was having trouble fitting in socially in Isla Vista. The videos\nwere merely a way of expressing himself. There was nothing during the contact with the suspect\nthat gave deputies reason to believe he was a danger to himself or others. Such risk factors are\nrequired in order to place someone on an involuntary mental health hold, or to legally search their\nresidence.140\nAfter they were finished speaking with the suspect, one of the deputies called Chin and briefed her\non the situation. The deputy asked Chin if the YouTube videos she watched were suicidal or\nhomicidal in nature. Chin said they were not. Chin told the deputy that the videos made it seem\nlike the suspect was very lonely and was having a difficult time in Santa Barbara. At the end of\nthe conversation, the deputy asked Chin if she needed further assistance, or if there was anything\nelse that needed to be done. Chin did not request any follow-up action.\n139 SBSO case 14-7754 140 California Welfare & Institutions code \u00c2\u00a75150(a) When a person, as a result of a mental health disorder, is a danger\nto others, or to himself or herself, or gravely disabled, a peace officer, professional person in charge of a facility\ndesignated by the county for evaluation and treatment, member of the attending staff, as defined by regulation, of a\nfacility designated by the county for evaluation and treatment, designated members of a mobile crisis team, or\nprofessional person designated by the county may, upon probable cause, take, or cause to be taken, the person into\ncustody for a period of up to 72 hours for assessment, evaluation, and crisis intervention, or placement for evaluation\nand treatment in a facility designated by the county for evaluation and treatment and approved by the State Department\nof Health Care Services.

It's too bad she is such a horse-\nfaced slut.\u00e2\u20ac The BMW drove away from her boyfriend without further incident.\nThe female was upset over this comment, so she drove around the beach parking lot and located\nthe BMW. She confronted the male driver and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond. The female said she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel\nright about this situation, so she drove away.\nAfter driving away, the female noticed the BMW speeding throughout the Goleta Beach parking\nlot, almost hitting several vehicles.

Peter later remarried Soumaya\nAkaaboune, the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stepmother. Chin never remarried.\nThe suspect first showed signs of being shy when he was seven years old. Between the ages of\nseven and eight, the suspect received speech therapy for a lisp. The lisp was corrected from the\ntherapy sessions.\nThe suspect was right-handed.

The suspect loved Lucky and would take\nher out on walks.\nThe suspect was never exposed to weapons by either of his parents while growing up. Peter was\nvehemently against having firearms in the house. The suspect never showed any interest in\nfirearms or other weapons either during adolescence or his adult years. The suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents were\nincredulous as to how the suspect was able to purchase so many firearms. They were shocked he\nhad firearms in the first place, since he had never previously shown any interest in guns.\nThe suspect was very possessive of his property. He once wrote a fantasy-type story (similar to\nLord of the Rings), which he read to Peter. The suspect never gave Peter a copy. The suspect\nnever left any of his property at Peter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house during his visits there. He would always gather his\npossessions and take them when he left.\nThe suspect didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license until after high school. He had a preference for luxury\nvehicles. The suspect felt that owning a luxury car, such as a BMW, would bolster his social status\nand help him find a girlfriend.\nIn early 2011, the suspect took karate lessons.

This incident was never reported to law enforcement.\nPage | 49\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nSuspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Family\nPeter and Chin Rodger divorced when the suspect was seven years old.146 Once the divorce was\nfinalized, Peter and Chin had joint (50%) custody of Georgia and the suspect. Georgia and the\nsuspect would switch between households each week (one week on, one week off). Other than the\ntypical difficulties a child would experience from a divorce, the suspect did not show an excessive\namount of distress over it.\nPeter began dating Soumaya Akaaboune shortly after he and Chin divorced. They married about\n10 years ago. Peter and Soumaya had a son together. Peter and Soumaya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son, the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s half-\nbrother, is 14 years younger than the suspect. The suspect was very loving toward his younger\nbrother and they often spent time together doing activities. Peter was never concerned about the\nsuspect harming or mistreating his half-brother.147\nPeter and Chin remained cordial with each other in the years following their divorce. They were\nin constant communication about the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social problems and worked together to provide\nthe suspect with necessary resources.\nOthers Involved in Suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Life\nThe suspect had no known friends during his time in Isla Vista.

This rule was strictly\nenforced while the suspect stayed with his father. Without these restrictions, the suspect would play for hours without\nstopping.\nPage | 50\nIsla Vista Mass Murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May 23, 2014\nSanta Barbara County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office Investigative Summary\nThe suspect was very conscious of his appearance. He maintained a healthy diet and exercised to\nstay in shape. The suspect favored designer-brand clothing and accessories such as high-end\nsunglasses. He felt this projected image of affluence would result in women being attracted to\nhim.\nThe suspect preferred females with blond hair. Shortly after moving to Isla Vista, the suspect wrote\nin his journal that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blonds\u00e2\u20ac were his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153favorite.\u00e2\u20ac149\nShortly before his death, the suspect told Peter that he went to bed early and woke up before dawn\nbecause he liked to watch the sunrise. This was new behavior for the suspect, although he had\nalways tended to be an early riser.\nEducational Background150\nThe suspect was reported as being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quiet\u00e2\u20ac in 1st grade. When he was between seven and eight\nyears old, the suspect was observed sitting by himself and not interacting with others. In 5th grade,\nthe suspect made some friends who would come over to his house. The suspect would ride\nskateboards and play video games with his friends.\nThe suspect was reported as being unresponsive in class, did not want to participate and did not\nengage others in conversation. He would stare off into space or at objects. The suspect was eligible\nfor special education based on the fact that he displayed behaviors similar to Asperger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Syndrome.\nThe suspect was reported to have hidden behind a building at recess, regularly withdrew from\ngroup conversations, displayed perfectionistic tendencies, and other obsessive-compulsive\nbehaviors. As an example, the suspect was reported to need all items on his desk in the just the\nright place.\nIn high school, the suspect needed reassurance from the teacher about five to ten times per day.\nHe was able, albeit reluctantly, to socialize appropriately with others only if they sought him out.\nWhile attending Independence Continuation School, the suspect was able to complete most of his\nclass work on time. The suspect also completed his homework in a timely manner.\nThe suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxiety continued to negatively impact his ability to socialize and participate in\ncertain school activities. Most of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interaction with school peers was online while\nplaying video games. This appears to have pushed him into a deeper state of depression which he\ntried to mitigate by playing more video games, namely, World of Warcraft.\nThe suspect attended numerous public schools throughout the San Fernando Valley area of Los\nAngeles County. He graduated from Independence Continuation School (a high school), where\nhe received weekly therapy.

Some of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental\nhealth records were made available to sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detectives. A resounding concern regarding the\nsuspect was his inability to establish and maintain new friendships. He preferred to stay at home\nand not go to places with his family. At around five or six years old, the suspect reportedly cried\nat Disneyland due to the crowds and his inability to wait in line for a long duration. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\nable to stay at Disneyland because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there were too many people.\u00e2\u20ac\nAt the age of seven, the suspect was able to make good eye contact while speaking, but offered\nvery little information unless he was asked direct questions.

For example, if the\nsuspect had an event to attend, such as a party, he would take the medication. The suspect would\nnot take Paxil on a regular basis.\nIn 2011, the suspect wrote the following in his journal:157\nThe pills my doctor prescribed me recently to treat social anxiety have been a disaster.\nThe side effects make me too drowsy and tired and they give me headaches. Looks like I\nwould have to rely entirely on my mind and positive thinking to overcome my shyness.\nThe suspect was picky about what he ate. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like sauces or anything that had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gooey\u00e2\u20ac\ntexture, such as melted cheese.

While living in Isla Vista, the suspect received services from three social\ncounselors through a Santa Barbara-based agency.158 The counselors helped the suspect with\nsocial and communication skills while integrating with the public. The suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal was to\nintegrate with the Isla Vista/college culture, which he defined as having a girlfriend and being\naccepted by the community where he lived.\nThe suspect also received services from Gavin Linderman, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153life skills coach.\u00e2\u20ac Linderman met\nwith the suspect in Los Angeles for psychosocial rehabilitation and life skills instruction.\nDespite this assistance, the suspect still had difficulty meeting people, once described as an\ninability to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153break the ice.\u00e2\u20ac Because of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued anger toward couples and inability\nto socially integrate with his peers, it was recommended he enter a residential treatment facility\nwith daily therapy, group therapy and social skills development.\nThe suspect was taking Xanax in 2014. It was prescribed to him a few months prior to his death\nto help him cope with anxiety. The suspect said he could cope with anxiety after taking Xanax.\nIn 2014, the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anxiety and frustration toward couples increased dramatically. He reportedly\nhad several videos on his cell phone of couples in the community who bothered him.159 He would\n156 In 2007, the suspect was evaluated for autism.

The\nsuspect appeared to really enjoy the work. Peter believed the suspect primarily enjoyed the work\nbecause he enjoyed the company of Peter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friend who had hired him. This was the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only\nknown employment that his family could remember.\nThe suspect believed menial or entry-level jobs were beneath him.
