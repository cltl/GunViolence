(KTHV) \u2013 A three-year-old is fighting for his life after a triple shooting that left one man dead on Monday.\nThe shooting happened at an apartment complex in west Little Rock.\nThe mother and her child were rushed to the hospital on Monday morning after police say 23-year-old Denzell Braud shot them.\nA third victim, Cordarell Collins, was also shot inside this Arkansas River apartment. The 22-year-old did not survive.\nPolice were not able to speak about the motive behind the shooting, but they say both men lived in the complex.\n\u201cWe're not going to reveal everything at this time because we are thinking this possibly could go to trial, but it's definitely going to be domestic in nature.\u201d\nA 21-year-old mother and her three-year-old son were also shot.\nThe mother has been released, but her son is still in critical condition.\nThe news came as a shock for some neighbors.\n\"It's very surprising; shocking really, cause you never see anything like that over here. It's usually very calm and everything's good,\u201d a resident said.\nBut not for others. A woman that THV11 spoke with was too afraid to go on camera, but she said that there is a line she won't allow her 8-year-old son to cross because of safety concerns with the Arkansas River Apartments. She lives in the neighboring apartment complex and says she will be moving out next month.\nBraud is facing a capital murder charge, two counts of intent to commit capital murder, and a battery charge.\nBecause he's charged with capital murder, he is being held in the Pulaski County Jail without bond.\nStay with THV11 and THV11.com for more details as they become available."}
