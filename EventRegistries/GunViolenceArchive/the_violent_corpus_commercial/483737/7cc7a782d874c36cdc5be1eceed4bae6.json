A promotional poster indicated rap artists Nino, King Samson and Lil Mouse performed at the event.\nPlease install the latest Adobe Flash Player Plugin to watch this content.\nA YouTube video for the Lil Mouse song \u201cIm 4real\u201d shows the rapper and his crew wearing apparel emblazoned with the phrase \u201cno talking\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the no-snitch code that governs much of the city\u2019s gang violence. The song lyrics feature gratuitous allusions to gun violence.\nThree people \u2014 a 19-year-old woman, 21-year-old man and 23-year-old man \u2014 were driven to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn with gunshot wounds, Alfaro said. The 19-year-old woman was shot seven times, according to dispatch reports. All three were listed in \u201cstable\u201d condition.\nTwo men, ages 20 and 21, were in \u201cstable\u201d condition after one was taken by ambulance and another driven to Holy Cross Hospital, police said.\nTwo other men, ages 26 and 36, were also in \u201cstable\u201d condition after being driven to Little Company of Mary Hospital and Health Care Center, Alfaro said.\nBut police on the scene said the exact number of injured was hard to determine because a handful of the wounded were driven to hospitals by people they knew.\nIn a statement issued later Thursday morning, the club\u2019s owner, Gene Linton, said that for 23 years he has \u201cearned the reputation as one of the most respected businessmen in Cook County. Never has any incident of this magnitude occurred at the establishment.\u201d\nLinton\u2019s statement said the \u201csenseless\u201d incident \u201cinitiated on the exterior of our building after hours\u201d and he is conducting a review of all security measures at the nightclub in conjunction with the police investigation.\nAdditionally, Linton said, \u201cWe ask that the general public join us in praying for the victims of this cowardly act. We also have pledged our full and complete cooperation with the Chicago Police Department in its investigation\u2026\u201d\nNo one was in custody Thursday morning as Area South detectives investigate.\nSun-Times Media Wire \u00a9 Chicago Sun-Times 2013.
