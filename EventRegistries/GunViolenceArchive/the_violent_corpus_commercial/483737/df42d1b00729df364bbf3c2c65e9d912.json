He said the shooting appeared to be gang-related.\nAll seven of the people shot are in \"stable\" condition, Alfaro said.\nA 20-year-old man was taken by ambulance to Holy Cross Hospital, Alfaro said. Another 21-year-old showed up there without the help of paramedics.\nTwo men, ages 26 and 36, showed up at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park with bullet wounds.\nA 19-year-old woman, a 21-year-old man and a 23-year-old man were driven to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn.\nAmong those slated to attend the party was Chicago rapper King Samson who invited people via Twitter to Mr. G's Wednesday night.\nHours after the violence ended, Rev. Michael Pfleger of the Faith Community of St. Sabina in Auburn Gresham called the shooters \"coward punks\" on Facebook.\n\"The Shooters today are not only lost but they are COWARDS!\" Pleger's Facebook profile read, \"...today these COWARD PUNKS shoot into groups in playgrounds, folks sitting on a porch, thru a house window, into a van or like last night at Mr G'S into a crowd! These shooters are not tough, they are COWARD PUNKS who are not even man enough to stand up for what they believe.\""}
