The incident was reported shortly before 4 p.m. from a home in the 7300 block of Brevard Avenue.\nNOPD spokesman Officer Garry Flot said the investigation into the incident was ongoing and it had not yet been determined whether criminal negligence charges would be lodged against the gun owner or adults who left the child temporarily unattended.\nNOPD detectives and officers still were inside the house interviewing occupants nearly two hours after the incident. They left at 6 p.m., with no one taken into custody.\nA man who answered the door at the house said he was there to support his parents, who did not wish to speak with a reporter at the moment. He said that the injured child \"was doing fine, by all reports.\"\nStay with NOLA.com for more details as they develop."}
