He\u2019s a rotation player on Alabama\u2019s line, and the Tide have a College Football Playoff semifinal game at the Peach Bowl on New Year\u2019s Eve, against Washington. Whether Ball could play in two weeks depends, of course, on the extent and severity of his injury, which isn\u2019t yet public. Nor is which finger was shot, for that matter.\nHere\u2019s to a speedy recovery for Ball. If he\u2019s out, he\u2019ll be a loss, although Alabama has enough great defensive front players to weather the absence of just about anyone.\nBall was a three-star recruit in 2012, and he\u2019s worked his way up in Saban\u2019s program over time. He played sparingly as a lineman as a redshirt freshman in 2013, then spent 2014 and 2015 working as a tight end.\nBack on defense this year, he has 12 total tackles and a half-sack. He\u2019s listed as a backup end behind starter Dalvin Tomlinson."}
