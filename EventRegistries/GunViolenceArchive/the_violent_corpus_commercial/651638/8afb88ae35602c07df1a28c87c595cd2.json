Coal County Undersheriff Bobby Hatton met with the family at Mercy Hospital Ada after the incident.\n\u201cI was advised a Ruger LC9s semi automatic 9 mm pistol was lying in the console area of the vehicle as (the man, the child and the grandfather) were sitting in the vehicle,\u201d Hatton said in a report. \u201cAt some point, the pistol discharged and passed through the console, striking (the child) in both legs and striking (the father) in the left leg approximately three inches above the knee. The bullet lodged in (the father\u2019s leg).\u201d\nHatton said after a short interview with the father, the father and child were airlifted to an Oklahoma City hospital for treatment of their wounds, which, authorities said, were not life-threatening.\nHatton said at this time he was unsure how the gun discharged but authorities do believe it was an accident. The incident remains under investigation."}
