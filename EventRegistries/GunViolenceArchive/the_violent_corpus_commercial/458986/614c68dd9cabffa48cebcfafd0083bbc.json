The boy was transported to Marietta Memorial with non-life threatening injuries.\nInvestigators do not know if anyone else was home at the time.\nOfficials will continue investigating to find out how a minor got a gun in his possession without adult supervision.\n\"It's still under investigation so we'll look at the totality of all the circumstances and see if there was any criminal activity involved and make a determination. It was non0life threatening injuries which is better than obviously shooting someone else and it being a fatality,\" says Captain Troy Hawking, WCSO.\nOfficials are looking into if any gun laws were violated. They say charges could be possible.\nThe Ohio DNR also responded in case it was a hunting accident."}
