One happened last month.\nThe family says they're shocked this has happened to them twice.\nThey say the kids have always grown-up around guns and learned to always assume a gun was loaded.\nSo they still can not believe this happened. Last month they were told 27-year-old Eric Tusing was in Burlington, joking with friends about playing Russian Roulette.\nThat's when he accidentally shot himself not knowing the gun was loaded.\nEric's sister says he was a loving and protective father, brother and son.\nWhat's so shocking to her is that Eric died nine years after his half-brother Tristan died from an accidental shooting.\nEric's half brother Tristan died while at a friend's house in 2007 when a gun fell to the ground and shot him the back.\nThey hope this is a reminder how important gun safety is for people of all ages.\nThey're hosting a fundraiser and silent auction on March 26 at Pipeliners Bar and Grill in Washington to pay for Eric's funeral costs.\nThe two brothers were very close. Eric named his second son after Tristan."}
