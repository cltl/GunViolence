Police said only one person who was shot was in critical condition. Yet Tuesday, 20-year-old Gerome Battle was well enough to address the media from his hospital bed at Jackson Memorial Hospital.\nBattle was shot in the buttocks, with the bullet coming to rest near his bladder. He underwent surgery Monday.\n\u201cI took off running and after that the second shot hit me in the butt. I kept running and put my hand behind me and seen the blood on my hand. I just told somebody to help me, help me,\u201d Battle said. \u201cMy stomach hurts. They put staples in it. But I\u2019m going to be OK.\u201d\nREAD MORE: Eight people shot following parade\nShawnteri Wilson, 18, led the procession back into Martin Luther King Jr. Park on Tuesday.

Flowers was also charged with child abuse.\nPolice said they recovered a 9mm Taurus Millenium semi-automatic handgun. Flowers told police he grabbed his gun from his waistband when he heard gunshots and stuck his three kids under the playground set.\nBrito-Peralta was taken into custody, police said, after officers noticed a gun in his waistband.

And in Hallandale Beach, one man was killed and two others were injured after gunfire erupted near the route of that city\u2019s Martin Luther King Day Parade.\nThe shootings in Miami-Dade on Monday also brought back fresh memories of another bloody day in the county, 20 years ago. That day, 5-year-old Rickia Isaac was killed by a stray bullet while walking home from the MLK Day Parade.\nThe bloodshed spilled Monday at the park has reinvigorated a fight against youth gun violence that has been waged in Miami-Dade over the past decade. A Miami Herald investigation last year showed that 316 teens and children were lost to gunfire in the decade from 2007 through 2016.\n\u201cGunshots rang out in a playground where children were playing. And this is unacceptable,\u201d said Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez. \u201cIt takes all of us to protect all of us. There were hundreds of people in the park during the shooting. People know what happened and we\u2019re asking them to come forward.\u201d\nBattle, who\u2019s likely to spend more than a week in the hospital, said he attends the parade every year and going to the park has become a tradition.
