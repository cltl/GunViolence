JSO has not confirmed exactly how many suspects may be involved as it is still very early in the investigation.\nHackney indicated the shooting is gang-related and emphasized this type of behavior will not be tolerated.\nAuthorities do not believe the individuals in the car were the targets, but more so the people in the house. However, Hackney said it is still too early to confirm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no shock that gang and violence go together,\u201d Hackney said. \u201cThe senseless nature of these killings continues to draw the attention of the public.\u201d\nThe police chief said they still had a lot of evidence to process and witnesses to interview.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be done alone, we can\u2019t do it by ourselves,\u201d Hackney said. \u201cWhen these things happen, people call, we\u2019re counting on that. Evidence leads a lot of ways, but somebody picking up the phone always helps.\u201d\nHackney appealed to the public to pick up the phone and call authorities if they had any information that could lead to a suspect.\nThe phone number to call for Crime Stoppers is 1-866-845-TIPS.\nCopyright 2016 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved."}
