Doctors say that at this point, taking that bullet out will do more harm than good.\n\"She was walking to the store, it was three buildings apart. It's not really far, but it seems like this was a gang war,\" said the child's father, who did not want to be identified.\nThree buildings down seemed harmless enough for the 4-year-old walking alongside her mother to the store.\n\"My family was walking, and somebody started to shoot,\" said the father.\nThe gunshots came from out of nowhere just after 5:00 on that Saturday evening on Willow Street. The family is so rattled that they did not want to show their faces or use their names.\nBruce has been charged with second degree assault in the shooting and also first degree robbery and criminal possession of a weapon."}
