They say the bullet went through a wall and fragments struck his 14-year-old sibling in the next bedroom.\nWhen officers arrived at the home in the 200 block of SE Sims Circle to investigate, they say the brother denied being involved and said the bullet went through a window after being shot by a passing car.\nCrime scene investigators were called and using lasers determined that could not have happened because the wall the bullet struck is at a 90 degree angle from the window.\nPolice say after the shooting the teen went outside, broke the window and hid the firearm in the neighborhood.\nUsing a K-9 police say they found the weapon across the street from the home in a grassy area.\nAccording to police, investigators determined the 16-year-old was sitting in a chair in his bedroom when the gun went off.\nHe's been charged with possession of a firearm by a minor 2nd offense and violation of probation.\nHis sister was treated at a hospital for superficial wounds to her arm and torso, according to police.\nCopyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.
