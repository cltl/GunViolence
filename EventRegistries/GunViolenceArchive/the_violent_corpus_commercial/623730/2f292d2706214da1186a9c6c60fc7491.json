Ryan Cantrell said Sunday, less than 24 hours after a 17-year-old boy died and two others were injured when gunfire broke out in the 2500 block of Muir Road. \u201cI\u2019m going to chalk it up as an anomaly. \u2026 Things sometimes happen in waves.\u201d\nThe wave of violence here has been particularly noticeable since August began; four people have been killed in shootings since Aug. 2, three of them since Friday.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t figured it all out yet,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cAre one or two of these related? That\u2019s just one of the questions we\u2019re trying to get answered. All possibilities are on the table.\u201d\nOfficers found the teen on the sidewalk when they arrived at the Muir Road residence after being called there at 7:34 p.m. Saturday, Cantrell said. He\u2019d been shot more than once and was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities have not identified him.\nAn 18-year-old man and another 17-year-old boy went to a hospital after the shooting. An ambulance took the 18-year-old, and the 17-year-old drove himself, Cantrell said. Each was shot once, but neither of their injuries was life-threatening, he said.\n\u201cIt happened in front of a house party that was going on inside the house,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cWe\u2019re still talking to witnesses and getting an idea what happened.\u201d\nDetectives also continued to investigate the circumstances surrounding two fatal shootings Friday. Police found 18-year-old Rogelio Torres II, of Hayward, dead inside a car in the 26000 block of Gading Road shortly before 11 p.m. Officers attempted CPR on Torres, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. About 11 hours earlier, at 12:05 p.m., officers found 63-year-old Neal Frybarger dead from a gunshot wound in the garage of a home in the 28000 block of Thorup Lane.\nAfter a standoff and negotiations, police arrested a woman in her 60s on suspicion of killing Frybarger, but they have not identified her yet, citing that investigation and the others. They have not made any arrests in the other killings, nor have they identified any suspects.\n\u201cAre we dealing with domestic violence or robberies or gang stuff?\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been working so hard. Our detectives have been here since Tuesday,\u201d when a family disturbance ended with 59-year-old Albert Williams shot to death in the 27000 block of Eucalyptus Court.\nCantrell said five of the department\u2019s 14 detectives were working the homicides Sunday. The homicide Saturday brought to seven the number of homicides in Hayward this year. Police continue to interview witnesses and develop information on the shootings, Cantrell said, and they need the public\u2019s help. Anyone with information is asked to contact Hayward police at 510-293-7072."}
