Gasconade County Sheriff Randy Esphorst said the young girl \u201cgot access to the loaded handgun, pointed it at her mother, and pulled the trigger.\u201d\nEsphorst said the round struck the woman in the leg and exited her body.\n\u201cIt was through-and-through the leg, it went through a wall, and hit a concrete wall where the round disintegrated,\u201d said Esphorst.\nSheriff\u2019s Sgt. Scott Eiler said the incident was reported at 7:46 p.m. Thursday as an \u201caccidental discharge of a firearm.\u201d\nOwensville Area Ambulance District personnel transported the 27-year-old woman to Mercy Hospital Washington with a gunshot wounded to her right thigh, according to Eiler. The bullet also passed through a vanity in the corner of a room before going through a wall and into an exterior concrete wall.\n\u201cEverbody was lucky,\u201d said Eiler. \u201cIt could have been a lot worse.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s name was not released. Eiler said a report was being finalized Tuesday afternoon and would be submitted to Gasconade County Prosecuting Attorney Mary Weston for her review of possible charges. Eiler said the Family Services Division was also notified of the incident.\n\u201cThey have contacted the family and have conducted their investigation,\u201d said Eiler. \u201cIt\u2019s still an ongoing investigation with them.\u201d"}
