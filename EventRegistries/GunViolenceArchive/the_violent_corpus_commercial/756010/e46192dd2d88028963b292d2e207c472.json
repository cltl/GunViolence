She was taken to St. Luke's Magic Valley where she died from the injury.\nThe Twin Falls Police Department arrested Brandon Smithson in relation to the incident. He is being charged with involuntary manslaughter. Smithson will be arraigned in court on Friday.\nAccording to court documents Smithson and Budden were roommates. Smithson told police that he was showing the shotgun, which belonged to a third roommate, to some friends. He checked to see if there was any ammunition in it, and he didn't think that there was. That's when he put the gun down to his waste and pulled on the trigger. He told police he didn't mean to shoot and didn't think there was anything in there.\nThere is a notice of intent to seek an enhanced penalty on the charges of unintentional manslaughter. That's because of Idaho Statute 19-2520 which says there may be \"extended sentence for use of firearm or deadly weapon.\"\nThe maximum charge for unintentional manslaughter is up to 10 years in a state penitentiary and up to a $10,000 fine. There is also a potential civil penalty of up to $5,000. The enhanced charges could add up to 15 years on top of that.\nSmithson is scheduled to appear in court for a preliminary hearing on Jan. 27. He is being held on a $75,000 bond. He has no previous criminal charges.\nThe Twin Falls County Coroner scheduled an autopsy for Monday morning.\nClick here to read the original story."}
