(AP) -- Baton Rouge police say a 2-year-old shot a 1-year-old sibling in the face inside a parked car in north Baton Rouge Tuesday evening, leaving the infant in serious condition.\nThe children's mother, 23-year-old Crystal Kinchen, was arrested Wednesday, according to a report from The Advocate in Baton Rouge.\nPolice spokesman Sgt. L'Jean McKneely said the shooting was called into EMS at 7:23 p.m. and occurred at a strip mall.\nMcKneely says that there were two adults around but he's not sure how the 2-year-old got a hold of the gun. He says the family drove the injured child to the hospital rather than wait on EMS.\nThe mother is facing a count of cruelty to juveniles.\nKinchen told police she was preoccupied with her cell phone while sitting with her children in a friend's car in the parking lot of a Family Dollar on North Foster when the 2-year-old child apparently found the loaded handgun wedged between the driver's seat and the center console, a Baton Rouge police report says.\nThe gunshot sounded like a firecracker, Kinchen said, according to the report. But her friend quickly found her daughter on the back seat floor suffering from a gunshot wound.\nNeither child was buckled in with a seatbelt or in a child seat, the report says, and the way the gun was jammed in next to the driver's seat meant the toddler could only have reached it while Kinchen was alone in the car with her children.\nThe friend sped the family to Our Lady of the Lake Medical Center after the shooting rather than wait for EMS, a police spokesman told The Advocate Tuesday night. Detectives met Kinchen and her friend at the hospital and escorted them to a police station for questioning, according to the report."}
