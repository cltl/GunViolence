Steve Fore told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nThe boy normally lives with his grandmother but was visiting his mother for the summer, said his cousin Tramaine Cash after getting word that the child was shot in the head around 1 p.m.\n\u201cMy heart just dropped,\u201d said Cash, who said the boy had been having a playful vacation. \u201cHe likes to play sports. He likes to rap. He just wants to be a normal kid.\u201d\nHow the shooting happened at the Windward Forest apartment complex had not yet been disclosed by police. Detectives were still trying to determine all the facts surrounding the shooting Wednesday afternoon, Fore said.\n\u201cIf you are going to have weapons in the house, you have to practice responsible gun ownership \u2014 those weapons should be secured,\u201dFore said. \u201cNobody likes to see someone injured like this, and when it happens to a child that makes it that much worse.\u201d\nFamily members, including a 7-year-old and a 24-year-old, were in the apartment at the time of the shooting, Fore said."}
