When they could not, the SWAT team entered the home at 7:30 p.m. and found the bodies, said Davis.\nDavis said he believes the children killed in the shooting were 9 and 10 years old.\nThe names of the victims have not been released.\nDavis said all of the victims were shot.\n\"It's a situation that just takes your heart. It's sad. It's horrific,\" Davis said. \"Your heart just goes out to the family members and everyone involved,\" he said.\nThe Greenwood Index-Journal has identified the alleged gunman as 27-year-old Bryan Sweatt. He was among the dead, according to the paper. A family member confirmed to News 4 that Sweatt was the shooter.\nAccording to court records from the Greenwood County Clerk of Court, Sweatt had two active criminal cases, one for petty larceny and the other for burglary.\nCourt records also show Sweatt had 22 previous criminal charges dating back to the years 2005 and 2010. Those charges included assault and battery, forgery, burglary and malicious injury.\nDeputies say they believe the gunman was dating one of the victims, but they have not yet named Sweatt as the shooter.\nBernard Rush went to check on the children at the neighbor's house this morning. He said they were all doing OK.\nRush said the children who were freed by the shooter were all girls and all related to the victims.\n\"This is just an experience you don\u2019t believe,\" said Rush. \"For all the family members to be gone at one time. And that somebody could do this to somebody else.\u201d\nRush said the children are all with other family members now.\nJeff Hicks, who has lived in the neighborhood for five years, told News 4 the couple who lived in the home had several grandchildren.\nHe said the family had a dirt track on their property and children were frequently there riding 4-wheelers.\n\"They were good people. It's unreal that situations get this bad. It's awful,\" Hicks said."}
