Hamilton police say the boy had been playing with a handgun he found in his mother\u2019s purse when he shot himself Thursday.\nIn a 911 audio file released by police, a woman identifying herself as Marques Green\u2019s mother says she carried the gun in her purse, and had set the purse down after getting home.\nIt was the second apparently accidental gunshot death of a young person this month in Hamilton."}
