No arrests have been made so far in that case and they didn\u2019t release the name of the victim.\nLess than an hour after the shooting on Farnell Drive, a 17-year-old was shot to death at the Exxon Station on St. Stephens Road. Mobile Police arrested two people. 17-year-old Fabian Russell was arrested and charged with robbery in this case. As he was led to police cars he told TV cameras police arrested the wrong man. His co-defendant, 18-year-old Christopher Logan was charged with first-degree robbery and murder. It is unusual for a murder suspect to be as talkative as Mr. Logan.\n\u201cSelf-defense, all I can say is self-defense, I had to stand up for myself,\u201d said Logan. I asked him what happened at the gas station as officers were leading him to a squad car. \u201cMan I was trying to get some gas, [racial slur] asked me if I wanted some, I tell him no I\u2019m good, [racial slur] hopped in my car I told him to get out, [racial slur] opened up, I did what I had to do.\u201d Mobile Police accidentally led him to the wrong patrol car causing him to spend even more time in front of microphones and he kept talking about what he says happened.\n\u201cAll them [racial slur] had guns. Everybody had guns, everybody. [Racial slur] pulled his gun out he didn\u2019t shoot and I shot first, self-defense,\u201d said Logan. Seconds later he would contradict himself. \u201cJust because he showed me his gun doesn\u2019t mean I have to show him mine as soon as he pulled his gun out what happened, he got shot, he shot at me first, he shot about five times and I let one shot loose.\u201d Mobile Police haven\u2019t released the identities of either victim in these early morning murders.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
