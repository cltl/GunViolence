(WRIC) \u2014 A local mother is calling for an end to the violence after two children were shot while on their way to the store in Richmond over the weekend.\nThe shooting occurred Saturday night in Mosby Court. We\u2019re told 11-year-old Jalil Austin was visiting his grandmother to celebrate his performance in a football game earlier that day where he won MVP, was named Homecoming King and Offensive Player of the Year for his middle school team. Around 8 p.m., he was walking to the store with his 13-year-old uncle when shots rang out.\n\u201cWe were walking and a car pulled up made a U-turn and started shooting at us,\u201d Austin told 8News, just hours after being released from the hospital Monday. \u201cThe bullets were going really fast. They were shooting everywhere and I just got hit.\u201d\n\u201cWe were walking and a car pulled up made a U-turn and started shooting at us. The bullets were going really fast. They were shooting everywhere.\u201d\nA bullet struck him in the leg.\n\u201cI kept running,\u201d Austin said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get shot again. I was running fast. I turned the corner and fell to the ground, then my uncle picked me up and carried me up the hill.\u201d\nOne bullet also struck a 14-year-old girl in the back.\n\u201cWhen we were in the hospital, we kept checking on each other,\u201d Austin said. Surrounded by family and close friends on the sidelines at middle school football practice, Austin said he was shaken up by the random gunfire, but is not looking back.\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to keep practicing, working on my leg and get better for next year.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like no 11-year-old should experience getting shot,\u201d Austin\u2019s mother, Shavonne Brown, told 8News earlier on Monday. \u201cNo 13-year-old should have to experience saving his nephew\u2019s life. My brother saved my baby. My brother picked my baby up and carried him to safety.\u201d\n\u201cWhoever did this to my baby doesn\u2019t know how it feels. You don\u2019t know my baby wakes up hollering for my brother to run faster.\u201d\nWe\u2019re told the 14-year-old girl was treated and released. Doctors released Austin on Monday, but his mother says her son is struggling to sleep through the nightmares.\n\u201cWhoever did this to my baby doesn\u2019t know how it feels,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my baby wakes up hollering for my brother to run faster.\u201d\nAustin\u2019s stepfather, Justin Henao, said he had to break the news to his stepson that he can no longer do something he loves to do \u2014 play football \u2014 at least for the rest of the season.\n\u201cThrough the grace of God he\u2019ll be able to walk again,\u201d Henao said. \u201cYou got to prepare him mentally for this, you know? He\u2019s a kid, he wants to do what all other kids are doing.\u201d\nIn response to the shooting, people gathered Monday to march through Mosby Court calling for the community to put the guns down.\nTo help support Austin\u2019s family as he recovers, click here.\nPlease install the latest Adobe Flash Player Plugin to watch this content.\nThis is a developing story.
