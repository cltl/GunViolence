Her friends say she was genuinely a good person.\n\"She is a sweet girl, I wish this on no family and nobody deserves this, I wish this on no family,\u201d Ana Marie said.\n\"The girl had a bright future ahead of her, she was well respected from day one,\u201d the neighbor said.\nNeighbors say the Bull Creek Apartments is usually a safe place to be and they can't believe this happened.\n\"It was sad man, it\u2019s real sad,\u201d said the neighbor.\nCopyright WTVM 2017.
