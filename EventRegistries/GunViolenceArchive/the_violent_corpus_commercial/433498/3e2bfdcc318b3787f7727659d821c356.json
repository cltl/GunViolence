Brown ran away because he had a warrant and later gave a friend a backpack with bloody clothing inside, according to charging papers.\nWhen the friend realized what was inside, he turned it over to police.\nDetectives arrested Brown at his girlfriend\u2019s house. He told police the shooting was an accident.\nHe said he found the weapon under some brush during the walk. He said he didn\u2019t realize it was loaded, \u201cfidgeted with it\u201d and the gun went off, records show.\nBrown initially told police he left the gun at the scene and then said he discarded it near a sign.\nHis girlfriend told detectives she thought Brown got the gun from his uncle because he went somewhere with Gastelum and came back with the revolver.\nA family friend told police Brown asked for a ride to buy a .22-caliber gun. Another witness told detectives Gastelum admitted he gave the gun to his nephew.\nPolice tried to interview Gastelum after Demello died but were unable to find him. He was arrested Tuesday after a security officer recognized him in municipal court.\n\u201cWe want to hold him responsible for giving somebody a gun that was later used in a crime,\u201d Lakewood police Lt. Chris Lawler said.\nStacia Glenn: 253-597-8653"}
