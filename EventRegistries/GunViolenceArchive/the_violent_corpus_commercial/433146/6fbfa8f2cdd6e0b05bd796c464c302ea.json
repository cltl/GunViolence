They walked back to the house on Campbell and were standing outside when a car drove by and opened fire about 7:20 p.m.\nSeven people, all adults in their early 30s to mid-40s, were shot, Gilmore said. One person was airlifted to Stroger Hospital; another was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn; and a third was taken to Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey.
