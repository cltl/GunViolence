(AP) \u2014 A southern Missouri sheriff has identified the final three victims in a shooting rampage that left seven people dead before the gunman killed himself.\nTexas County Sheriff James Sigman announced Saturday that 68-year-old Darrell Dean Shriver; his son, 46-year-old Carey Dean Shriver; and Carey\u2019s wife, 44-year-old Valirea Love Shriver, died in the violence that began late Thursday night in the unincorporated town of Tyrone. The name of a 67-year-old woman who was injured was not released.\nAuthorities say the three victims identified Saturday and four others were killed by 36-year-old Joseph Jesse Aldridge in four different homes. The four other victims were Aldridge\u2019s cousins and their spouses.\nAldridge was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in nearby Shannon County.\nAuthorities are still investigating a possible motive.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
