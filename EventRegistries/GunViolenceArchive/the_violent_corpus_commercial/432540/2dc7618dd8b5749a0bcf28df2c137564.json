We've got two folks that have been shot,\u201d said Sgt. Ashley Henson. \"Initially from what we understand the handgun was dropped and when it dropped it discharged, striking both victims.\"\nAccording to the Sheriff's Office, four kids were in the house at the time of the shooting.\n\"We've spoken with the mother and a couple children who were in the home and everything they're saying seems to fit with the evidence we've seen,\u201d Henson said.\nPolice say the mother was doing her 8-year-old daughter\u2019s hair. The girl was sitting between her mother\u2019s legs when the gun fell to the ground.\nThe bullet went through the mother\u2019s leg and struck the child in the head. The child died on the scene.\nThe 45-year-old mother was transported to a local hospital and underwent surgery overnight. Detectives say she is recovering at Floyd Medical Center in Rome with her oldest son by her side.\nPolice say although all signs point to a terrible accident, they are still investigating it as if it were a crime.\nThey say they want to know why the gun was out in the first place and how it fell to the ground. But investigators say they'll give the mother time to grieve and bury her child before pressing her with those questions."}
