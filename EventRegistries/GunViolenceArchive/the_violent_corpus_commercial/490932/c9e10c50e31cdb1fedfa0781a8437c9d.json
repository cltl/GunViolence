(CBS) \u2013 Officials say one person is dead and four others were injured after a shooting at a birthday party at a Hamilton Township, New Jersey home late Friday night.\nThe shooting happened around 11:30 p.m. on the 1100 block of Deutz Avenue.\nAccording to authorities, about 100 people were in the living room of the home celebrating a 15-year-old\u2019s birthday party when gun shots were fired.\n\u201cWe saw them taking one of the kids away on a stretcher, then we saw another stretcher going in, and then they were taking somebody else out on a stretcher,\u201d said neighbor Mary Pearsall.\nAuthorities say 17-year-old Shakir Williams was shot multiple times and pronounced dead on the scene.\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking because at the end of the day, the parents have to bury their 17-year-old child,\u201d said neighbor Fortuna Jordan.\n\u201cMy heart goes out to them because their child just came to a party to have a good time, and now isn\u2019t going to go home,\u201d said Pearsall.\nFour other males, between the ages of 16-18 were also injured. One of them was shot multiple times and spent five hours in surgery and is now listed in critical but stable condition.
