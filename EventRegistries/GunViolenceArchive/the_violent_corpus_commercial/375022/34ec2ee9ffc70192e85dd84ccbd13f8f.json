At least one other person remained hospitalized Friday with wounds suffered in the attack.\nAuthorities have yet to determine the motive behind Abdulazeez\u2019s attack. The 24-year-old, who grew up in Chattanooga and had no known ties to foreign terrorist groups, was killed in a gun battle with police shortly after he used an automatic weapon to attack a U.S. Naval Reserve center and a recruitment office. Federal officials announced an investigation into a trip Abdulazeez took to the Middle East in 2014 and have examined a pair of Islam-themed blog posts he purportedly wrote in the days prior to the Chattanooga shooting.\nGunnery Sgt. Thomas J. Sullivan was the first confirmed victim in the Chattanooga shooting. Sullivan, 40, was a Springfield, Massachusetts native and Iraq War veteran who received a Purple Heart after he was wounded in combat. His family confirmed his death early Friday to MassLive.com.\nOne of #Chattanooga shooting victims 2 tour #USMC #Iraq veteran.
