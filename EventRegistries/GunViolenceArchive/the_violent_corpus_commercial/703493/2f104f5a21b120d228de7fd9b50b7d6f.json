The two suspects are identified as 20-year-old Deanthony Shiquan Billingsley and 21-year-old Cardamien Demun Braxton Cooper of Hueytown. They have warrants for their arrest on two counts of attempted murder and one count of shooting into an occupied dwelling.\nBessemer police Lt. Cortice Miles said both suspects have extensive records with violent-type crimes. He said if you see them, do not approach. He explained they are absolutely still armed, and very dangerous. Both are believed to still be in the area of Jefferson County, but Miles emphasized no matter where they try to hide, \u201cwe will find you\u2026if you don\u2019t turn yourself in, we will find you.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to hide, but they can\u2019t hide long,\u201d Miles said. Miles seemed especially determined to capture the suspects, who he said were careless and reckless shooting into an occupied home like they didn\u2019t understand that bullets have to go somewhere when you shoot them.\nOfficials believe the two shot the male victim around 11:10 p.m. over a dispute, then shot into the home. Officers were called back to the home around 1:30 a.m.; it appears the child did not wake up when she was shot, and woke up later complaining of stomach pain.Her mother, fearing her child was shot, called 911. She was taken to the hospital in serious condition, and is now stable in the ICU. The male victim\u2019s injuries are not life threatening.\nMiles said police do not believe the shootings to be gang-related, and have an idea of what the dispute is about.\nBoth suspects are armed and considered to be dangerous. Please call 911 or local law enforcement if you see them or know any information about their whereabouts.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
