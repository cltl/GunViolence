It's scary, kind of, that there's always people getting shot around here, especially kids.\"\n\"(It's) just a scary thought, that could happen to anyone really around here, so close to home. Kind of makes me nervous to walk outside any more,\" neighbor Tim Watson said.\nInvestigators have not confirmed the relationship between the shooter and the victim.\nA relative of the people who live in the house told WLWT his teenage cousin had friends over and the victim and the suspect were friends.\nThe shooting remains under investigation.\nAnyone with information is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 513-352-3040."}
