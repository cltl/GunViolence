The couple decided to check on their kids at about 9 p.m. before heading out again, said Cpl. L\u2019Jean McKneely, a Baton Rouge police spokesman.\nWhile they were at their house at 2014 Tennessee St., Forbes decided to check on his gun and found it was malfunctioning \u2014 and while trying to fix it, the gun fired, McKneely said.\nThe bullet struck the baby-sitter, Murrain Hawkins, of 3405 Myrtlelawn St., in the abdomen.\nWhen police arrived, they found Hawkins lying on the ground with a bullet wound and Forbes trying to administer aid, McKneely said. The teen was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.\nForbes was questioned and ultimately booked into Parish Prison on a count of negligent homicide. His bail was set at $10,000.\nIt was unclear whether Hawkins and Forbes are related, McKneely said."}
