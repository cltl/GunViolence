Once I checked my first child, then I checked the one in my hands and I felt something warm in my hand. I looked down and he was bleeding, so I just lost it.\"\nAccording to a detective at the scene, the child, whose name is Bless Nurse, is in stable condition at Eggleston hospital.\nInvestigators said 23-year-old Derico Clark told police he dropped the firearm and accidentally pulled the trigger.\nHe fired one round, hitting himself in the hand. The same bullet shot a 21-year-old woman in his apartment in the leg, went through the wall, into another apartment and struck the 4-month-old in the back. Family members said the bullet grazed the baby's liver.\nAll of the victims were transported to the hospital in stable condition.\nClark is facing reckless conduct charges. The grandmother of the infant said reckless conduct is not enough.\n\"That's just a slap on the wrist,\" Willie Ushry said. \"Drug dealers go to prison, why not someone who shoots a defenseless child.\"\nCopyright 2016 KPNX"}
