Gardner surrendered just after 1 a.m. Friday morning, about 11 hours after the shooting. He walked alone into an LPSO substation with the knowledge he was a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in Braxton\u2019s death, sheriff\u2019s office spokesman Brennan Matherne said.\nGardner answered questions without legal representation. He told detectives the bullet fired as he tried to unload a 9mm pistol he discovered lying forsaken near a house, Matherne said. Gardner relayed that he and Braxton were friends.\nAfter the shooting, Gardner and others in the group moved Braxton\u2019s body to the side of the road, Matherne said. They asked bystanders to call 9-1-1, and they fled the area. At some point, Gardner discarded the gun.\nDetails of Gardner\u2019s confession meshed with the accounts of bystanders, Matherne said.\nBraxton was shot one time in the face and was pronounced dead at the scene.\nGardner, who is being held in lieu of a $250,000 bond, saw District Judge Jerome Barbera for a magistrate hearing on Monday. Gardner told Barbera he would provide his own attorney and is scheduled for arraignment on July 10 before Judge Ashly Bruce Simpson, said Leslie Richard, investigator with the district attorney\u2019s office.\nAs of Monday afternoon, the sheriff\u2019s office had not submitted a formal arrest report to the district attorney\u2019s office. Ultimately, prosecutors will determine what charge, if any, is to be filed against Gardner.\nLouisiana law defines negligent homicide as the killing of a human by criminal negligence, which occurs when \u201cthere is such disregard of the interest of others that the offender\u2019s conduct amounts to a gross deviation below the standard of care expected to be maintained by a reasonably careful man under like circumstances,\u201d according to a separate statute.\nA conviction of negligent homicide carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\nAs of Monday, the gun had not been recovered. Deputies\u2019 search for the firearm remained a priority in the ongoing investigation, Matherne said.\nThose who helped Gardner move Braxton\u2019s body out of the road also answered detectives\u2019 questions. Matherne declined to say how many people were in the group with Braxton and Gardner, and as of Monday, no charges were filed against anyone else. \u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate bringing any charges (against other people) at this time,\u201d Matherne said.\nBraxton, according to a swim coach, was a raw athlete guided by a want to be independent.\n\u201cHis future was up to him to decide. He was a very athletic swimmer; it was his to do what he wanted with,\u201d said Erin Danos, head coach of the south Lafourche club swim team, the Hurricanes. Danos coached Braxton for the past six years.\nOn May 31, in his last swim meet, Braxton led a relay team otherwise consisting of inexperienced members to a second-place finish in one race, Danos said.\n\u201cHe is a very good butterfly-er, but he\u2019s a very good sprinter (as well),\u201d Danos said. \u201cHe was able to keep up with people with very little practice, he would keep up at a swim meets and beat people who would practice every day. \u2026 He was a very explosive swimmer.\u201d\nCorey Callais, swim coach at South Lafourche, said Braxton\u2019s talent in the butterfly was natural. As a freshman, Braxton placed in the top eight at the state track meet last November.\n\u201cHe was just so powerful,\u201d Callais said. \u201cAs many years as I\u2019ve been involved in swimming, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve seen a butterfly that powerful, not for someone that young.\u201d\nCallais said Braxton exuded confidence\n\u201cHe always knew how to make you laugh,\u201d Callais said. \u201cHe was one of those kids, you want to give him a hug at one point and at the next, you wanted to throw him in the pool. That\u2019s Braxton.\n\u201cBraxton was always God\u2019s gift to women. He always joked around with the girls on the team. He was the \u2018black Michael Phelps.\u2019 He had that much confidence in himself. It showed in the pool.\u201d\nGaye Cheramie, South Lafourche High\u2019s principal, said she has known Braxton since the day he was born, a byproduct of living in a small, rural community.\n\u201cHe always had a smile,\u201d Cheramie said, adding they spoke frequently in the school\u2019s hallways. \u201cI can still picture him on the bench, right in front of our concession area, with his friends. He always had friends around him.\u201d\nCheramie, while careful not to comment on the scrutinized circumstances surrounding the shooting, said the tragedy perpetuates the idea her community is vulnerable to gun violence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that the potential of this young man will never be fulfilled. It\u2019s sad, and it\u2019s scary,\u201d Cheramie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been isolated from a lot of the things going on in society today because we are a rural, close-knit community. I feel like what the rest of the country is experiencing is filtering down. \u2026 For handguns to be so readily available to children in the streets, it\u2019s so disheartening.\u201d"}
