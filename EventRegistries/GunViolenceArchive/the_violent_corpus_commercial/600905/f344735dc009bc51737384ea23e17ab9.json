Philly basketball game\nKywayne Hill, 18, surrendered to police Wednesday morning after a monthlong manhunt, and will face murder and other charges, said Capt. James Clark of the Homicide Unit.\nHill is accused of shooting into a crowd outside a basketball tournament July 11 at Cobbs Creek Park, Clark said.

Clark said Wednesday that police believe that Richardson and Hill used the same gun, which is why both will be charged with murder.\nRichardson's preliminary hearing is scheduled for Aug. 30, according to court records.\nA list of Hill's other charges was not available Wednesday afternoon.\n215-854-2817\n@cs_palmer"}
