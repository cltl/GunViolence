A 15-year-old boy was killed, and two other teens suffered non-life threatening wounds.\nHomicide Captain James Clark says the suspect, armed with a semi-automatic weapon, fired 10 shots killing 15-year-old Tyhir Barnes and wounding two other boys of the 60th and Baltimore basketball team.\nClark describes it as an ambush style shooting stemming from a buzzer-beater basketball game last Thursday, where 60th and Baltimore beat the 56th and Christian team.\nHe said there was a fist fight at that game last week that was quickly broken up, but the dispute was apparently not over.\n\u201cWe know our shooter is from the 56th and Christian Street team, lives in that area, so what we are doing now is getting rosters from the kids on that team and other teams. We are bringing these kids in with their parents and hopefully they will identify the shooter,\u201d said Clark.\nCaptain Clark says he is confident an arrest will be made soon."}
