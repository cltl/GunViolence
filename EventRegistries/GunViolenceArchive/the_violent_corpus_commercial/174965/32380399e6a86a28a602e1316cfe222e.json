Why so many guns?\" LaShandra Pope asked.\nOfficers said Douglas had that AK-47, a 12-gauge shotgun and a handgun.\n\"It's not that serious to have that many guns around a child. Not that many to keep safe,\" Pope said.\nLittle Tradon Crawford was in stable condition at last check.\nPolice arrested his mother and charged her with child cruelty and reckless conduct a day after the shooting.\nDetectives said Tradon found one of the guns in a room and started playing with it Thursday night. Officers said Douglas endangered Tradon's safety by not locking up the weapons.\nTenants said having one unsecured gun around a child is not good. They said three takes it a step further.\n\"That makes it worse. Three guns, loaded,\" Ray Coleman said.\nTenants said they understand Douglas wanted to protect her family from intruders. But they said keeping her family safe from threats in her home is just as important.\n\"Hey, you got to be more careful around your kids. You got to be more careful,\" Coleman said.\nDouglas is being held on $10,000 bond.\nThe judge ordered her to stay away from firearms when she gets out."}
