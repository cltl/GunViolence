Much of the activity CBS 11 saw from detectives focused on a trailer next to Official Paintball Games of Texas.\nIn a positive sign, a family member said when the doctors went to intubate the boy, he woke up and he was alert. That\u2019s certainly good news, considering that deputies said he was shot in the back of the head.\nInvestigators say two little boys, a 5-year-old and a 6-year-old, were watching TV in a travel trailer in the remote area, in the 1700 block of Adams Trail. Investigators said the boys were apparently the only ones inside the trailer. The family says the boys are brothers, and their mother was inside helping sign in people at the paintball center.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies said at some point the 5-year-old found a 9mm Glock handgun. The 6-year-old reportedly told the 5-year-old to put away the gun, but the next thing he knew, he heard a gunshot and found his brother on the floor.\nFirst responders flew the 5-year-old to Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center, where at last check he was, according to the family, fighting the doctors as they tried to intubate him.\nThe family also said the 6-year-old was not hurt and is back home.\n(\u00a92016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
