When officers arrived, they found a vehicle with multiple bullet holes in it.\nOne passenger, 16-year-old Jemmelle Raymond, died at the scene. Another victim, 18-year-old Dre'quan Burnett, was transported to a nearby hospital where he died. A third victim is listed in stable condition at a local hospital.

Suarez.\nThose in the neighborhood are growing frustrated with the continuing violence.\n\"I'm so sick of these people you know killing up each other,\" said Inez Harris, who watched as her front yard became a crime scene. \"It's stupid, it's really stupid.
