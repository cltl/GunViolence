But it wasn\u2019t clear just when the shooting happened.\nElijah Jackson, 36; Shacora Jackson, 40; and Nateyah Yafah Hines, 19, were all found dead, according to the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office. All three lived on the same block as the shooting.\nA fourth person, 45-year-old Scott Travis Thompson of the first block of Kempton Drive in Romeoville, was also found dead, according to the medical examiner\u2019s office.\nShacora Jackson suffered multiple gunshot wounds, and the other victims each suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head, according to the medical examiner\u2019s office.\nThree of the victims were found inside the home, and one of the women was found outside, police said.\nA fifth victim, an 18-year-old woman also found outside with at least one gunshot wound, was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where she remained in critical condition. Detectives had not interviewed her as of Sunday evening, police said.\nA 2-year-old boy was also in the house. He was unharmed and was taken to Roseland Community Hospital for observation.\n\u201cThe investigation has revealed people in the home were selling potential narcotics out that home earlier in the day,\u201d police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. \u201cAnd we believe individuals returned to rob occupants in that home.\n\u201cDetectives said they have very optimistic leads,\u201d Guglielmi said, adding that police recovered substances that appeared to be illegal narcotics from the home.\n\u201cIt\u2019s known that people in the home knew their attackers,\u201d Guglielmi said, adding that no weapon has been found.\nPolice initially thought the shooting may have stemmed from a domestic situation, but they walked the theory back as more evidence came to light.\nSaturday\u2019s shooting was the third time in 24 hours in Chicago in which at least four people were shot in a single incident.\nMore than 750 people have been killed so far this year, Chicago\u2019s deadliest since the late 1990s."}
