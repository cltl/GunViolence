The 18-year-old, a male, is in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head, said Sgt. Tony Turnbull, department spokesman.\nTurnbull said the car from which shots were fired was southbound on 44th Street, south of 15th Avenue. He said the victims were standing on the sidewalk on the west side of 44th street when shots rang out. The car was described only as a dark-colored compact.\nTurnbull said it is unclear whether there was more than one shooter. When deputies arrived, there were three people with gunshot wounds at the scene. They were taken to area hospitals. A fourth person drove or was driven to a hospital before deputies arrived. The fifth person remained at the scene.\nThe ages of the those injured are 18, 20, 23, 53 and 64, and all live in the neighborhood, Turnbull said. A party was being held at a home on the street at the time of the shooting.\nTurnbull said homicide and gang detectives were at the scene, though it was not known whether the shooting was gang related. He said gang detectives routinely respond to such incidents. Homicide detectives joined the investigation because the 18-year-old\u2019s injuries are considered life-threatening.\nCathy Locke: 916-321-5287, @lockecathy"}
