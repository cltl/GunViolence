Officer Michael Hewitt with the Indianapolis Metro Police Department said none of the injuries appear to be life-threatening.\nOfficers handcuffed a man shortly after arriving at the scene. According to the police report, the shooter waved down an officer and told him he pulled the trigger. He said he\u2019d done it all in self-defense because the people he shot were trying to attack him and had already attacked one of his friends.\nInvestigators said they found four people suffering from gunshot wounds on the sidewalk on Broad Ripple Avenue in front of The Wild Beaver Saloon. All four of the injured were men between the ages of 24 and 30. Emergency crews took them to area hospitals. One had a serious injury from a bullet hitting his upper leg.\nThe shooting happened around the corner on College Avenue in area of The Vogue. Officers recovered a nine millimeter handgun from the car of the man who identified himself as the shooter.\nOfficer Hewitt said it wasn\u2019t clear if the shooter or the victims had been at another nightclub nearby. The crime scene was crowded as hundreds of people were leaving bars and clubs in the area.\nWitnesses told Fox59 they heard a man claiming he had been punched in the face just before the shots started.\nThe incident is classified as an aggravated assault, but charges had yet to be filed as of Friday morning."}
