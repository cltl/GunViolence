The gun's seller was not home but had left the 22-caliber rifle in an unlocked car for the 21-year-old to inspect.\nDeputies say the 21-year-old posed with the gun so the 16-year-old girl could take a picture and that's when the gun fired.\nA bullet struck the girl in the chest. She was transported to the hospital, but doctors were not able to save her.\nOn Monday, authorities identified the girl as Selena Lewis, of Maiden NC.\nReleased images show the green-colored rifle the man was looking to buy.\nThe shooting is still under investigation, but deputies say it appears to be an accident. No charges have been filed."}
