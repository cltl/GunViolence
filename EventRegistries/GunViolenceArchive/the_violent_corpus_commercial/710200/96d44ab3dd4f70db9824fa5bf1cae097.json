Police said McMillian was talking to friends when she was killed.\nInvestigators said 30-year-old Saeve Evans was seen on surveillance footage firing a weapon at the same time and place where McMillian was killed.\nPerson of interest in fatal shooting of Breyona McMillian turns himself in to police\n\"I can tell you specifically that the video shows Saeve Evans in possession of a firearm and firing it and we do believe it was fired multiple times,\u201d said Interim D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham. \u201cThat is the information that we have been able to confirm at this point.\u201d\nA police source tells FOX 5's Lindsay Watts that Evans turned himself in to police Tuesday night.\n\u201cA 16-year-old girl has been killed in broad daylight, and now we have identified a person who might be able to help us close this case,\u201d said D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.\nAccording to police, McMillian was an innocent bystander and not the intended target. But the motive of the shooting is still unclear.\nPolice said Evans is not charged with the teenager\u2019s murder, but he may have important information that could help investigators close the case. Evans is wanted for unlawful possession of a firearm. However, detectives cannot confirm if the shots he fired killed McMillian.\nCourt records show in August 2014, Evans was accused of being one of two gunmen who opened fire on a group of people enjoying a cookout in Southwest D.C. Six people were shot and wounded in the incident. Evans spent nine months in jail before prosecutors dismissed the charge.\n\u201cDetectives are working hard to bring closure to Ms. McMillian\u2019s family,\u201d said Newsham. \u201cWe have identified a person of interest and are asking for the community\u2019s assistance in locating this individual. If anyone has information please come forward.\u201d\nOn Monday night, Newsham met with residents to discuss growing crime concerns in Southeast D.C."}
