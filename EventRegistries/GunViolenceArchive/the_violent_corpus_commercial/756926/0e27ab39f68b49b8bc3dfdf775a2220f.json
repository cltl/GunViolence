The guard\u2019s round missed the robbery suspect and struck Kincaid-Hill in the chest. She later died at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center.\nOfficer Scott Williams, a Henderson police spokesman, said the unidentified robbery suspect entered the store and threatened Kincaid-Hill. The security guard then challenged the man, determined there was a threat and fired the shot that missed the suspect and killed Kincaid-Hill.\nThe gunman ran from the scene empty-handed and was still at large Monday.\nThe shooting occurred just minutes before the store\u2019s 9 p.m. closing time. Ryder-Curry, who lives nearby, said she saw the large police response but didn\u2019t think much of it. When she turned on the morning news the next day, she saw her friend\u2019s store had been the site of an attempted robbery and an employee had been killed.\nThe would-be robber will face murder charges because Kincaid-Hill was killed during the crime. The security guard will not face charges in connection with the accidental shooting, Henderson police spokeswoman Michelle French said Sunday.\n\u201cI just hope that this person that did this, if they have any decency and any love left in their heart, they turn themselves in,\u201d Ryder-Curry said.\nJared posted a statement Sunday on Twitter about Kincaid-Hill: \u201cWe are shocked and saddened to learn of the loss of our team member and extend our sympathies to her family, friends and colleagues.\u201d\nKincaid-Hill had been working at the store since September.\nMichelle Zimkus stopped by the Jared, where she and her husband regularly shopped, to lay flowers Monday afternoon at a makeshift memorial.\nZimkus said Kincaid-Hill would remember her from prior visits and pick up conversations where they had left off. Kincaid-Hill also remembered jewelry preferences and could help Zimkus\u2019 husband choose items when he shopped alone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d Zimkus said, reflecting on Kincaid-Hill\u2019s death. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking overall.\u201d\nAnyone with information about the robbery can call the Henderson Police Department at 702-267-4911 or Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555 to remain anonymous.\nSaturday\u2019s incident is the second local jewelry store robbery in just over a week. A man armed with a handgun made off with an undisclosed amount of jewelry on Jan. 13 from the MJ Christensen Diamond Centers at 8980 W. Charleston Blvd. No one was injured.\nThis is the first homicide investigated by the Henderson Police Department in 2017 and the 14th homicide of the year in Clark County.\nContact Blake Apgar at bapgar@reviewjournal.com.
