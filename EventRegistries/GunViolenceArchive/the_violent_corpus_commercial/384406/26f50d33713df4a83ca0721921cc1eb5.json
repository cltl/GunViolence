(WDRB) -- We now know the identity of a 17-year-old who has been arrested and charged with murder in connection with the shooting death of a teen in Fern Creek.\nDesean Mitchell was fatally shot on the night of Thursday, July 30, on Hudson Lane, near Fairground Road in Fern Creek. A friend of Mitchell we are not identifying because he's underage says another friend of Mitchell's is the one who pulled the trigger.\n\"He shot my friend in the head and it was an accident, it was definitely an accident. It was never on purpose,\" he said. \"He thought that I took the clip out and didn't have the clip in the gun, but he cocked it back a couple minutes later, he pointed it at Desean joking around, he pulled the trigger and it fired.\"\nLouisville Metro Police arrested the alleged shooter. We now know that person is 17-year-old Michael Williams. According to court documents, a grand jury indicted Williams on the murder charge on Tuesday. Jeff Cooke, a spokesperson for the Commonwealth Attorney's Office, tells WDRB the indictment is in connection with the murder of Mitchell.\nCooke said it started out as a juvenile case, but the grand jury's decision to indict means Williams is now charged as an adult.\nCopyright 2015 WDRB News.
