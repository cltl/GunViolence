He was free on $200,000 bail after his arrest on attempted murder charges in the Bronx in June, public records show.\nA handgun was recovered near the club and most of the victims were trapped between the gunfire and the hallway leading into the club, Adinaro said.\nThe wounded victims, who were shot in the legs, arms, chest and back, were treated at Westchester Medical Center.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this on Christmas Day,\u201d said police Capt. Edward Adinaro.\nThe man could face murder and five attempted murder charges, police said.\nThe late-night Christmas party was wrapping up when the gunfire pierced the air, witnesses said.\nMansion employee Cleveland Douse heard the shots from the second floor of the venue.\n\u201cI just heard shots fired and I run back upstairs,\u201d Douse said. \u201cWhen I come downstairs I see three men lying on the floor there.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad. It\u2019s a terrible thing,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter the party is said and done, everybody enjoying themselves.\u201d\nMount Vernon Mayor Richard Thomas and Bandoo\u2019s wife, Natasha Tender Bandoo, were outside the club Sunday morning as a crowd of mourners, some donning Santa hats, stood nearby.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dark day in our city,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cToday is a day we're supposed to spend with our family, not extend condolences. No person and no family should ever spend Christmas like this.\u201d\nBandoo left behind two young children, Thomas said.\nNatasha Tender Bandoo\u2019s grandfather, who did not give his name, said the Bandoos were recently involved in a lawsuit with the building\u2019s property owner.\n\"The case finalized early last week,\" the grandfather said. \"The club has done very well. He tried to buy the building from the owner and they didn't want to sell it to him.\"\nThe property price was jacked up to $2 million and that's when the Bandoos went to court to take on the building's owner.\nBut his granddaughter, Natasha, hadn\u2019t mentioned it to him because the case \"was a lot of stress.\"\nThe couple opened the club in 2014.\nAccording to the Mansion Instagram page, the venue, which doubles as a catering hall, hosts birthday parties, baby showers and weddings \u2014 as well as alcohol-fueled dance parties.\nBandoo\u2019s relatives were stunned by the holiday violence.\n\u201cHe was a loving and devoted husband and one of the best dads to his children, He was a loving Individual with the Biggest heart, Cuz you will definitely be missed\u201d Michelle Bandoo, a cousin, wrote in a touching Facebook post Sunday.\n\u201cMy heart is piercing for his poor wife and how she\u2019s gonna explain to my little cuz that Daddy is not coming back.\u201d"}
