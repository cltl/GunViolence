Police said he was shot in the living room of the home, at the corner of McCormick and Glenn streets in southwest Wichita.\nMegan Stumblingbear, his mother, said his co-workers inside the house were \u201cplaying with some of their Airsoft guns\u201d \u2014 a brand of replica firearm designed to shoot pellets \u2014 when one of them allegedly picked up a real handgun and fired it at her son.\nAfter the shooting, the people inside the home scattered, and police received a call that Stumblingbear had committed suicide, she said.\nHe was pronounced dead at 7:15 a.m. Friday.\nThat didn\u2019t make sense to the Stumblingbear family \u2014 suicide is strictly condemned in their Native American culture.\nplace_fact1\n\u201cI was taught that (when) people that kill themselves, they don\u2019t make it home,\u201d Megan Stumblingbear said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to go to heaven.\u201d\nThroughout the afternoon, police questioned other people inside the home and began seeking a 22-year-old man in connection with the case, Megan Stumblingbear said.\nWichita police Sgt. Nikki Woodrow said in a statement the man was arrested around 2:30 p.m. in the 2200 block of West McCormick.\nThe man arrested had just begun working with Mekko Stumblingbear on Tuesday, his mother said \u2014 he was called in to replace Mekko Stumblingbear when he was sick.\n\u201c(He) has known Mekko \u2026 all through high school and they were fine \u2014 they never had an issue,\u201d Megan Stumblingbear said.\n\u201cMekko \u2026 didn\u2019t have an issue with anyone. He was just one of those people that had a smile from ear to ear. He always wanted everyone to be happy.\u201d\nPolice investigators are working to determine whether the shooting was intentional or accidental, according to a news release from the department.\nMekko Stumblingbear was doing demolition work with Cessna Aircraft, said Selena Bozeman, one of his friends.\nplace_quote1\n\u201cHe was going to the military, and he was eventually going to go to college,\u201d said Bozeman, who said she first met Mekko Stumblingbear at Jardine Middle School. \u201cHe had a good job \u2014 he was about to try and start a family, actually. He had a lot going for him and it was all just stolen from him.\u201d\nHe was also active in the Native American community in Wichita, his mother said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s sung ever since he was 9 months old, basically \u2014 he couldn\u2019t even walk,\u201d she said, fighting back tears.\nBy 5 p.m., no police cars remained at the scene.\nMegan Stumblingbear\u2019s 6-year-old daughter ran up to her as she stood on the sidewalk, facing the home where her son was killed.\n\u201cMom, come see what we drew for Mekko! It\u2019s very pretty,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOK, I will \u2014 give me one second,\u201d Megan Stumblingbear said, wiping her eyes as she averted her glance from the home.\nMatt Riedl: 316-268-6660, @RiedlMatt"}
