He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in serious condition.\nThe other man, 25, was hit in the ankles and was taken to Stroger Hospital in fair condition, Lemmon said.\nTyra had been sitting in her father's lap when the shots rang out, she said.\n\"I heard the gunshots, and then I heard my dad say 'Get on the ground,'\" she said. As she ran inside the house, she realized she was bleeding from her arm.\n\"When I saw her she was all 'Ahhh,\" said Tyra's grandmother, Yvette Ruffin. \"Then I was like, 'Ohhhh, that's a bullet.' It skimmed her.\"\nHours after the shooting, Yvette stood in front of her brownstone two-flat with her arm wrapped tightly around Tyra's shoulders, as more of her grandchildren scurried and played around her.\n\"That's a nip,\" Yvette told her granddaughter, giving her a gentle squeeze. \"You ain't get shot, you just got nipped.\"\nBut Yvette didn't want to take any chances, she said. She wanted to leave the city, and take her family with her.\n\"We hear shots all the time,\" Yvette said. \"We got to make them go in the house. It's dangerous.\"\nTyra said she wanted to move away, too.\n\"I don't like it here,\" she said quietly, eyes fixed at the ground.\nNanette Rios was in her basement apartment below the porch when she heard the shots ring out, she said. Her 11-year-old son, Devin Henderson, was playing video games when she grabbed him by his shirt and pushed him into a closet to wait for the gunfire to end.\n\"I almost got shot,\" Devin said Thursday afternoon, scowling. He stood barefoot in front of his home, clutching a kids' version of the Bible. His finger bookmarked a page titled \"Passages to read when you're scared.\"\nDevin said he hears gunshots on the block constantly.\n\"I just feel like everything is wrong in the world,\" he said. \"I feel like everything is going to pieces.\"\nRios stood next to her son, beaming down at him.\n\"This got to stop, for real,\" she said. \"We got kids out here, you know. We're all families here. That's so wrong for them to shoot like this.\"\nPolice said both of the men shot were documented gang members.\n\"It might have been gang-related, I don't know,\" Yvette Ruffin said of the shooting.\nNo one was in custody, police said.\nOn average, nearly one child 13 or younger has been shot every week in Chicago this year, according to the Tribune.\nAn 8-year-old girl was shot in Austin on Aug. 21, police said. A week earlier, a 6-year-old girl was shot in Pullman.\nShe was one of at least four 6-year-old girls shot in Chicago this summer.\nA girl was shot along with her uncle, who died, in Park Manor in early August. In mid-July, a 6-year-old girl playing near her Englewood home was struck when she was caught in a crossfire of bullets.\nAnother 6-year-old girl was shot in Logan Square in June."}
