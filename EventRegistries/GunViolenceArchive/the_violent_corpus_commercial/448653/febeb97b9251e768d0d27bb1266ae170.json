He then shot and injured a man who lived at the home, and kidnapped his former girlfriend.\nThe three women who were killed have been identified as Sylvia Duffy, 71, her sister Clara Edwards, 68, and Edwards' daughter, Pamela O'Shel, 48. The woman who was kidnapped was Duffy's daughter.\nAs Abernathy fled the home, he ran into a Cherokee County Sheriff's deputy's vehicle that was responding to the scene. A short chase ensued and ended when Abernathy eventually crashed in Sand Rock.\nAbernathy was treated at a hospital and is now being held in the Cherokee County Detention Center on charges of capital murder, first degree kidnapping, first-degree criminal mischief and attempting to elude.\nThe woman who was kidnapped was also in the vehicle. She was treated at a hospital and released.\n\"It's just shocking because you don't expect things like this to happen. This is a very peaceful quiet community and just not something that's normal here,\" Sheriff Shaver said.\nShaver said there was no history of domestic violence between Abernathy and the mother of his child. However, he said the two would come to the sheriff's office to exchange the child for visits.\nIn late September, Abernathy filed for full custody of the infant, saying the child's mother had threatened to leave Alabama with the baby and he he feared for the child's safety.\nThe case is being investigated by the Cherokee County Major Crimes Unit.\nCopyright 2015 WBRC.
