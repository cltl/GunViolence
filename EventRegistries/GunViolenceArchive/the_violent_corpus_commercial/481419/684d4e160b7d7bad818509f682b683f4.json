She said, \u201cMy other neighbors were saying they were afraid to even walk out. So, I\u2019m considering moving somewhere, selling the house and moving.\u201d\n\u201cAs a police department, we\u2019re very concerned that these individuals that are walking our streets are just simply walking up into these neighborhoods and opening fire,\u201d said Detective Michael Wright, spokesman for the Miami Gardens Police Department.\nThe anonymous neighbor, who is the mother of a 14 year old boy, said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid for him. I won\u2019t even let him go to the park. And he\u2019s upset about that. But, I value his life and I want him around for a very, very long time.\u201d\nPolice urge anyone with information to call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS."}
