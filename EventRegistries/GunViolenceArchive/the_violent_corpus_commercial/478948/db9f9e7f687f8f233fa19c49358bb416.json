They've pleaded not guilty.\nCourt records show both men have prior felony convictions for robbery. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether they will seek the death penalty.\nPolice say the Poores were staying in the same apartment complex as the four victims, who were found bound and shot in the head.\nAuthorities believe the brothers robbed the women, then killed them because they feared they would be identified."}
