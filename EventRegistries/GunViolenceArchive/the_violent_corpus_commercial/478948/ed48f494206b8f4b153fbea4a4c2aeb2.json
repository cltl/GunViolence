Owasso near 61st and Peoria where they found four women shot to death.\nAccording to officers, police found a 3-year-old child unharmed at the apartment and placed him in protective custody.\nTwo of the victims were 23-year-old twin sisters, according to a family member.\n\"Whole life ahead of them, just gone down the drain like nothing,\" he said. \"Whoever did it, it didn't mean nothing to them. Nothing.\"\nPolice are canvassing the area and are asking for witnesses or anyone having any information to come forward.\nThey said they were called after someone had gone to the apartment to check on its occupants and found the four dead. Reportedly, an individual had spoken to an occupant of the apartment an hour before the bodies were discovered.\nPolice have released no information on any suspect or suspects at this time.\nBack in October, Fairmont Terrace management spoke with Tulsa police about increasing security at the complex.
