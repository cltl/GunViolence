Robinson can be heard screaming, \"Kill me, kill me.\"\n\"They handled themselves extremely well in a very difficult and trying circumstance,\" Cincinnati Police Lt. Steve Saunders said.\nSaunders wouldn't say if he believed this was an attempted \"suicide by cop.\"\n\"The officers reacted very quickly and they used their weapon retention skills and their training to make sure that didn't happen,\" he said.\nRobinson is charged with murder in connection with a shooting at the Western Glen Apartments on Montana Avenue on June 16.\nPolice said he shot a 17-year-old boy, who died, and another man, who survived.\n\"As a police officer, that's probably one of the worst nightmares you can play out in your head is somebody struggling with you over your gun,\" said Saunders.\nSaunders said each officer goes through 26 weeks of training, including self-defense for cases just like these, to keep everyone safe.\n\"Things can change in a moment's notice, in a quick instance and that's what happened here,\" said Saunders.\nIn addition to a murder charge, Robinson is also charged with attempting to take an officer's gun and assault on an officer.\nSaunders said the officers involved are already back on patrol."}
