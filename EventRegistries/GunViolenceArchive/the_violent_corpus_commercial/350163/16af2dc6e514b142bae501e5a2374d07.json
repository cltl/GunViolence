The man, armed with a handgun, fired at the woman, grazing her head.\nThe woman was able to get to a neighbor's house to seek help, but the man entered the home and found Reid and her grandfather, Robert Clarke, 66, upstairs, shooting and killing both.\nHe then took his own life, Tomba said.\nThe grandmother was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center in serious condition, but she was conscious and speaking with detectives, Tomba said.\nTomba said police do not suspect anyone else was involved with the shooting. The police department's Homicide Unit, Crime Scene Unit and the Medical Examiner's Office are investigating.\nNote: The age of the grandmother has been corrected per new information provided by the police"}
