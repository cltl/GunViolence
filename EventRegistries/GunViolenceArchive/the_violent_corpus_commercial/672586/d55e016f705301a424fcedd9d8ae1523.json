And they\u2019re weren\u2019t moving, they weren\u2019t talking,\u201d the witness explained.\nFirst responders rushed both mail victims to the hospital, where one of them died. Crime scene tape blocked off the alley behind the home as detectives brought in a K-9 unit to search the area.\n\u201cI was surprised. When I woke up, I saw all these cars out here. I said, \u2018Man, what happened?'\u201d said Lemar Miller, another resident in the neighborhood.\nMiller has lived in the Whittier neighborhood since 1980, and said he\u2019s disturbed by the deadly gunfire so close to home.\n\u201cIt just goes to show. I\u2019ve got my doors locked now,\u201d Miller told CBS4.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just too bad. Whoever these guys are, I\u2019m sorry for their families,\u201d the neighbor added.\nMelissa Garcia has been reporting for CBS4 News since March 2014.
