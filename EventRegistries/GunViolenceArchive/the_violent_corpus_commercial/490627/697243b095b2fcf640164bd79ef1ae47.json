The department late Saturday evening released a photo of the man and asked that anyone who can help identify him or locate \"a person who knows or has information on the suspect only known as John Doe\" to call the department's Force Investigation Section at 702-828-8452 or Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.\nFriday night's incident took place after police received several calls at about 7:10 p.m. about an armed man walking in and out of traffic near the Bellagio fountains, according to the news release. Police said further reports indicated that the man was carrying a handgun and aiming it at pedestrians.\nA patrol officer responded to the area near Bellagio, 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. South, and located the armed man in front of the fountains. The officer exited his vehicle and proceeded to issue commands to the man. He did not comply, and during the confrontation, the officer fired his handgun and missed the suspect, police said. Police did not say how many rounds the officer fired.\nTwo people were grazed in the gunfire, with a juvenile being wounded and an adult male receiving an \"entry into his clothing\" but no physical injury, Metro Capt.

He is being booked on \"numerous felony charges associated with him aiming a firearm at a number of citizens,\" McCarthy said. He also noted, \"We found a firearm on his person.\"\nMcCarthy said that the investigation is ongoing and that police have video footage \"that in fact corroborates what the callers stated.\"\nLas Vegas Boulevard was shut down in both directions Friday night, to both vehicle and pedestrian traffic from Tropicana Avenue to Flamingo Road.
