There's multiple gunshots fired inside the home. It will take us most of today and probably tonight to process the scene,\" he said.\nHierholzer said there was no forced entry to the home and that the entire incident happened inside the residence. He didn't say what type of weapon was used.\nHierholzer said Mark Cormier owned a chimney sweep company and Candace Cormier worked at a realty company. The couple had been married four or five years.\nCopyright 2016 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}
