Her husband is in critical condition.\nThey lived in the peaceful Shalako Estates subdivision on the outskirts of Kerrville, where neighbors never expected to wake up to a crime scene.\n\"It was all blocked off and had cop cars,\" neighbor Harold Williams says. \"They had a crime scene truck there.\"\nDeputies were initially called to a nearby house to help an injured man, 53-year-old Mark \"Cornbread\" Cormier.\n\"The injured man is the husband,\" Sheriff Rusty Hierholzer says. \"He was airlifted to San Antonio and is going through surgery.\"\nDeputies later found his wife Candace \"Candy\" Cormier and their adopted son Jeremiah dead inside their home.\n\"It is a very complex scene,\" Sheriff Hierholzer says. \"There were multiple gunshots fired inside the home.\"\nPeople who knew the family grieved, too shocked to speak with us. The Sheriff says it's hard for him to talk about the crime.\n\"In fact, I personally know these people,\" Sheriff Hierholzer says. \"She worked for one of the local real estate companies. And he's been doing chimney sweeps and air duct cleaning for years. In fact, we went to high school together.\"\nDeputies found a shotgun in the front yard. The Sheriff says a shooter is not on the loose, but won't speculate who pulled the trigger.\nThe Sheriff hopes the husband will eventually be able to speak with investigators about what happened, but is currently in critical condition."}
