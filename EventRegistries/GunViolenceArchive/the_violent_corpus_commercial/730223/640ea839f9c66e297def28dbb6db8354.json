One neighbor reported seeing a person in a tan or beige jacket running away from the area.\nSgt. Terrance Demarest said that it's not uncommon for people in Bordeaux to hear shots and not inform local authorities.\n\"Some people have been here a long time hearing shots and they just don't call,\" he said.\nBut neighbors in the area said it\u2019s unusual to hear gunshots, although they reported some thefts from vehicles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always quiet over here,\" neighbor Ralph Munk said. \u201cIt\u2019s really dark here at night. We\u2019ve been trying to get [the city] to do something about it.\u201d\nMunk, 63, has lived in the neighborhood for the last five years. He said he wishes police would patrol the area more than they currently do.\nThe investigation is ongoing, and police are looking at the surveillance footage from a nearby apartment complex and the natural gas facility.\nDetectives are working to learn more about Hambrick, including why he was at the Mattie Street/East Lane intersection last night. Anyone with information about this case is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 615-742-7463. Callers to Crime Stoppers can remain anonymous and qualify for a cash reward. Persons can also send an electronic tip by texting the word \u201cCASH\u201d along with the message to 274637 (CRIMES), or online at www.nashvillecrimestoppers.com.\nThis is a developing story.\nMOST POPULAR STORIES\nMayor Barry to propose pro soccer stadium at Nashville fairgrounds\nWatch live: March for Life live feed of events, speeches in D.C.\nGov.
