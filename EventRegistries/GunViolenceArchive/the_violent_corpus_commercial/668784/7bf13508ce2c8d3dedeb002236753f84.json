They say she has been a victim of domestic violence in the past and purchased the gun for personal protection.\nPolice say the 3-year-old was wounded by a 9mm handgun. The investigation is still going, but it's believed the child's mother was keeping the gun under a pillow.\n\u201cWe really haven't had a lot of incidents where children are shooting themselves with guns. But it\u2019s always searching through things they shouldn't,\u201d said Fort Worth Police Officer Tamara Valle. \u201cThey are busy bodies always trying to find things to get into. And when they do and they find that gun, it's just a bad situation\nIt's still not clear how the gun went off, but the bullet hit child's left arm. He was taken to Cook Children's Medical Center and is expected to recover.\nSo far, police are investigating the shooting as an accident. There were other children who live in the house, but police say they were in school.\nPolice say the mother was home with the 3-year-old and an infant sibling. People who saw the toddler at the hospital say he was alert and seemed to be doing alright.\nThe mother told police she recently got the gun for home protection.\n\u201cThere really hasn't been an increase that I've noted,\u201d said Valle. \u201cBut it's still wise to let people who have children in the house \u2013 if you have those weapons, just put them up. Don't let the children know where they are. Lock them up, and keep them safe.\u201d\nComments:\nThey are making this sound like a no big deal. A child shot it's self w/ a gun that was not in a safe place away from children and no adult charges filed yet? Just stupid. Reckless and Child Endangerment charges ya think....? Parents..wake up.
