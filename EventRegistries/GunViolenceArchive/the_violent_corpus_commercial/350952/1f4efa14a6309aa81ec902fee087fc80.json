He was released on 10 percent of a $4,000 bond.\nAccording to a police report, the boy was at his grandfather\u2019s home on Penhale Avenue where his uncle visited. Prasinos, who has an active carry-and-conceal permit set to expire in 2019, purportedly left his firearm on a chair in the house. Prasinos and the grandfather were working in the garden when they heard a loud bang.\nThey found the juvenile on the back porch bleeding.
