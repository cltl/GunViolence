They also found ammunition.\nIn the middle living room, police say they found $8,402 in cash and a prescription. In the kitchen, police found heroin and drug paraphernalia.\nAt the end of March, Shelton was arrested for charges stemming from a March 12 search of a home in Homewood in which weapons and ammunition were seized.\nPolice have not called Shelton a suspect in the Wilkinsburg case, but are still investigating whether or not he\u2019s connected.\nFive adults and an unborn child were killed back on March 9.\nStay With KDKA.com For More Details"}
