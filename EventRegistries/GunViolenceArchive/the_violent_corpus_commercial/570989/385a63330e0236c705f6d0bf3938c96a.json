Byers Ave. Police Capt. Bob Higginbotham said responding officers found Gary D. Huston already dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\nHigginbotham said family members who witnessed the shooting felt that it was accidental despite the threats that Huston had been making to take his own life. They reported that nerve damage suffered previously to the fingers of the hand in which he was holding the gun may have contributed to its accidental discharge, Higginbotham said.\nCoroner Rob Chappel said Monday that in light of the family's beliefs, he was ruling the death an accident."}
