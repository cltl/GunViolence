Craft said.\n?When officers arrived (at the hospital), they found that the two-year-old had a single 22 caliber gunshot wound to the upper inside arm and rib area.?\nThe investigation, he said, revealed that the child gained access to the handgun being stored in a gun-safe.\nWhile the door was open, and a parent was accessing some of the safe?s contents, he said, the child grabbed the barrel of the pistol hanging on a hook inside the safe door.\n?While pulling on the barrel of the pistol, it discharged and the bullet struck the child in the upper inner arm, then the rib area,? Craft said.\nAfter striking the rib, the bullet fragmented with only a small portion of the fragment entering the child?s chest causing minor internal injury.\nCraft said the young boy was transferred to Wichita for further examination and was released.\n?The investigation of this incident has been concluded with this listed as an unintentional discharge,? he said.\n?There is no such thing as being too safe (when it comes to guns),? he said.\nA gun safe is critical, but even so, children can get into places where adults don?t expect them to go, Craft added."}
