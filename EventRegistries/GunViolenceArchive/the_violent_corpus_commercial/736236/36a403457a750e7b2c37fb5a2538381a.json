He was shot and killed while riding in a car Tuesday night at the intersection of Central Avenue and Preston Street.\n\"He always struck me as a pleasant, energetic young man,\" said Dan Appino, head football coach at Auburn. \"He was always trying to do the right thing. He messed up from time to time like kids do, but he was always respectful.\"\nAllen's death is the 26th homicide in Rockford this year. It is the most in the city since there were 31 in 1996.\n\"He was an amazing young man,\" said Ashley Purty, who has been friends with Allen's mother for several years. \"He was always giving, caring and joking. His smile could melt any heart.\"\nRockford police said the shooting occurred at about 10:15 p.m. His mother, Jaton Watts, was driving, and there was one other person in the car. Police said numerous shots were fired from another vehicle, but could not say how many.\nPolice said Watts sustained injuries that are not life-threatening.
