Cyndi Thaldorf said. The girl was taken to a local hospital, where she was treated for undisclosed injuries, and later released.\nThe hospital contacted the Oshkosh Police Department.\nBy Monday afternoon, authorities had wrapped up their investigation into the incident, Sgt. Chris Gorte said.\nPolice would not release the nature of the girl's injuries, citing privacy concerns, but said alcohol was not a factor in the incident. Police will not recommend any charges in the incident.\n\"I think it was just one of those truly accidental and obviously unfortunate (incidents),\" Thaldorf said.\nShe used the incident to remind residents of proper safety procedures while cleaning firearms.\n\"Always take extreme care to make sure that the weapon is unloaded and rendered safe,\" she said. \"Always be extra careful, especially if anyone else is present when you're doing that.'\nNoellDickmann: (920) 426-6658 or ndickmann@thenorthwestern.com.
