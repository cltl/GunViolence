But several blocks later on Piedmont Ave. near the park, the SUV hit a bump and the gun fired, Crane said. It was still wrapped in a plastic Publix bag in which it had been stored, Crane said.\nCrane said McIver does not remember firing the gun. He was leaning back in the seat and nodding off when they hit the bump, the gun in his lap, Crane said.\nTex McIver was in the SUV\u2019s back seat. Diane McIver was seated in the front passenger seat.\nThe Fulton County Medical Examiner said she died of a gunshot wound to the back that had passed through the seat.\nThe couple had been traveling from their home in rural Putnam County to another in Buckhead. The driver exited at the Downtown Connector at Edgewood Avenue to avoid traffic, Crane said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy. They are two great professionals, philanthropists,\u201d Crane said.\nCrane said Tex McIver is \u201cunder extreme duress. Trauma.\u201d\nCrane said the couple had not been drinking.\nThe Atlanta Police Department has said almost nothing about the case, which involves two prominent residents. They declined to elaborate on Friday.\nThey released an incident report of the shooting on Wednesday, more than two days after officers responded to a call of a gunshot victim at the university hospital.\n\u201cThis is one of those situations we\u2019re working through very slowly,\u201d police Sgt. Warren Pickard said. \u201cWe want to get it right.\u201d\nThe police report did not list who was in the SUV, other than Diane McIver. An officer talked to the driver, but didn\u2019t include in the report what the driver said. Nor did the report say why the driver took the injured woman to a hospital on Clifton Road, 4 \u00bd miles away. Piedmont Hospital is less than half that distance from the shooting scene.\nDiane McIver, whom one associate described as \u201cextremely intellectual,\u201d made a successful career as president of Corey Airport Services, an Atlanta-based marketing company.\nHer husband, a partner in his firm, is vice president of the Georgia State Election Board. In August, he assumed another seat on another board. The American Bar Association appointed him to the advisory committee of the association\u2019s Standing Committee on Gun Violence."}
