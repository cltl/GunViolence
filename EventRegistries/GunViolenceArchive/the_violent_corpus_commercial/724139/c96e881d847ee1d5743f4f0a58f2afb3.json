Her grandson could face a charge of reckless discharge of a firearm causing death.\nPolice say the 13-year-old grandson was home alone with several other teens at a home on Tireman Street in Detroit. He got into his grandmother's bedroom. It is unclear whether it was locked or not. His grandmother's gun was hidden, but he found it. He loaded it and started playing with it. His friend was fatally shot.\nThe victim has been identified as EJ Watkins. His mom says he was in the eighth grade at Sampson-Webber Leadership Academy, loved playing chess, and electronics.\nPolice do not believe the shooting was intentional."}
