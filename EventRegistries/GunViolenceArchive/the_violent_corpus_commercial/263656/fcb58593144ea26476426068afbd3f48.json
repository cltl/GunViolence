Deputy Chief Steve Moore of the Simpsonville Police Department said the incident happened just before 2 p.m. while the child was alone in a bedroom.\n\"We know the child was in the bedroom. We know the gun was in the bedroom,\" Moore said.\nIt was not known how the child got to the handgun or how the gun was fired, authorities said. An autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday.\nThe mother was in the living room at the time with another child, a 2-year-old who wasn't injured, Moore said.\nFamily members could be seen outside the home Monday afternoon clutching each other.\nNeighbors said the family had moved into the home on Garfield Lane in the Bryson Meadows subdivision less than a year ago.\n\"I can't imagine,\" one neighbor said. \"It must be devastating to lose a child this close to Christmas.\"\nA forensics team and the Greenville County Coroner's Office was also on the scene.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the family,\" he said."}
