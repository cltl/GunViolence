The neighbor reported the unidentified man \u201chad accidentally shot himself in the chest,\u201d according to a news release from police.\nThe neighbor reported that the man was carrying a gun and seemed intoxicated.\n\u201cIt was unknown if this was possibly a suicide attempt,\u201d the release said.\nWhen police arrived, they saw the man still carrying the gun, the release said.\n\u201cWe arrive on scene. He\u2019s not compliant, doesn\u2019t want to engage with us, has a firearm in his hand,\u201d Davidson said.\n\u201cLess lethal\u201d rounds \u2014 which Davidson said would have been shot at the subject using a launcher \u2014 were used, and \u201cat some point an officer fires at least one round from a firearm,\u201d Davidson said.\nThe man later complied with officers and was taken to the hospital.\nDavidson didn\u2019t know how close the officer who fired was to the man, or how it was that officers weren\u2019t sure whether their bullet hit him.\n\u201cHe walked to the ambulance, from what I\u2019m told, so \u2026 his injuries did not appear to be life-threatening\u2026 ,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cIt sounds like when this man was detained, the obvious injury that was able to be seen is to his hand. There were not other injuries to him that were apparent or obvious.\u201d\nNobody else was injured during the incident, the news release said. Several streets were temporarily closed in the area and nearby homes and businesses were advised to shelter in place. Police don\u2019t believe any other suspects were involved.\nThe unidentified police officer who fired the shot, an 11-year veteran of the department, has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs review, a standard procedure for officer-involved shootings.\nA multi-jurisdictional \u201ccritical incident response team\u201d will conduct a parallel criminal investigation into the events, police said."}
