JULIET, Tenn. (WKRN) \u2013 A 16-year-old boy was shot Tuesday afternoon while two other teens were playing with a gun.\nDeputies were called to Davis Corner Road near Burton Road shortly after 1 p.m. where the teen was found with a bullet wound to his neck.\nHe was transported to Vanderbilt University Medical Center and released a few hours later.\nWKRN caught up with the teen, Edward Tillman, who can\u2019t believe his luck.\n\u201cI woke up and was like, \u2018I just got shot,\u2019\u201d said Edward. \u201cI was not a fan. I was like, \u2018I just got shot.\u2019 I\u2019m 16. I shouldn\u2019t be getting shot. My dad\u2019s 40 and he hasn\u2019t been shot yet. I\u2019m 16 and have a scar for the rest of my life.\u201d\nEdward explained the gun was brought over by his friends, and this incident has made him realize the importance of gun safety.\n\u201cIt was almost catastrophic. I could\u2019ve died easily, and I wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough that kids need to be safe with guns. It\u2019s just, they\u2019re dangerous. They really are.\u201d\nThe investigation is being handled by the Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Officials say charges in the case are possible.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
