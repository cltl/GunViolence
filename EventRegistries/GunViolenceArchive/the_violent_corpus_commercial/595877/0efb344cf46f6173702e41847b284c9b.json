The 16-year-old was in the front passenger seat of the Honda when shots were fired from behind the vehicle about 4 a.m. and he was hit, said Salt Lake Police Lt. Craig Gleason.\nPolice were notified of the shooting by \"friends of friends\" of the victim about 4:15 a.m., Chipping said. The vehicle was found on American Avenue, near 960 South and 1100 West. The teen was dead when officers arrived.\nThe right rear tire was on its rim and the left front tire was flat, he said. Multiple shell casings were found in the street where the shooting occurred. No information was immediately released Tuesday about the suspect vehicle.\n\"We don't have any real good reason to believe like a gang involvement kind of thing at the moment, but we're not ruling it out,\" he said.\nThe two teenage friends of the victim were still on scene when police arrived. Chipping said they were being interviewed by detectives to find out what they were doing at 4 a.m. and what possibly happened.\nAnyone with information on the shooting can call police at 801-799-3000.\nContributing: Shara Park\nTwitter: DNewsCrimeTeam"}
