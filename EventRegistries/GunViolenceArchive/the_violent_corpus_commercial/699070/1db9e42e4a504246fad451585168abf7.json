He turned himself in to investigators on Sunday.\nThe Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s Office says the boy, Caden Randolph, died after being shot in the chest Saturday at a home on the 3000 block of Sandpiper Avenue, just east of Grand Junction.\nThe county coroner\u2019s office says Caden died at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital. His manner of death has been ruled a homicide.\nMushrush is not related to Caden, investigators say, though the shooting happened at Mushrush\u2019s home. Officials said the boy was there visiting a friend.\nMushrush was interviewed by authorities in the hours after the shooting, but not immediately arrested. Further information gathered later by investigators \u201cimplicated Mr. Mushrush in criminal activity,\u201d leading to his arrest, officials said.\n\u201cWhen the gun went off, unfortunately the young boy happened to be in the line of fire,\u201d said Megan Terlecky, a sheriff\u2019s office spokeswoman. \u201cThis is a very sad tragedy and unfortunately an incident that didn\u2019t have to happen.\u201d\nTerlecky said Monday she wasn\u2019t sure if the gun was a handgun, a rifle or a shotgun.\n\u201cThere were possible plans for a target practice outing the following day,\u201d Terlecky said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the gun was out. Unfortunately, nearly every gun safety rule available does not appear to have been practiced.\u201d\nMushrush is being held at the Mesa County jail in lieu of $100,000 bail, records show.\nThe county sheriff\u2019s office says it is working with prosecutors and the coroner on the investigation. Court records in the case have been sealed.\n\u201cThis remains an ongoing, active investigation,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said in a news release."}
