Jared Collins, detective bureau commander at the Sheriff's Office.\nDeputies responded around 6:20 p.m. Monday to a home in the 3200 block of Cedar Hill Road Northwest in Canal Winchester, according to an incident report.\nCollins said the investigation into the incident that led to Danford's death is early, and he was not able to release further details about her death.\nNo arrests were made from the initial incident.\nIn a separate incident, a 2-year-old suffered a gunshot wound to the right leg Sunday. The boy is stable, Collins said, and will likely recover.\nDeputies responded around 1 p.m. to a home in the 9600 block of Oakland-Stoutsville road in Stoutsville. Collins said the 2-year-old boy was attempting to get a gun that was holstered in his father's belt.\nAs the boy's father attempted to push the gun back into its holster, it went off, Collins said. He added it might have snagged on something in the process of trying to get the gun back into the holster.\nA semi-automatic handgun, black plastic holster, tan pants with dried blood, a spent shell casing and a bullet were all collected as evidence from the scene, officials said.\ntthurston@lancastereaglegazette.com\n740-681-4345\nTwitter: @tristathurston"}
