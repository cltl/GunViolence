Her father, Marcell Oldham, and two other children in the vehicle were not harmed.\nThree Detroit men, Cleveland Tyvon Smelley, 30; Deonta Charles Bennett, 21; and Antoine Lamar Smelley, 32, are charged with first-degree murder and seven counts of assault with intent to murder.\nBishop Daryl Harris spoke at the funeral on behalf of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, Police Chief James Craig and the police department's chaplains.\n\"We wanted you to know from the city of Detroit that you grieve today, and we grieve with you,\" Harris said to the family. \"The police department will work very diligently to remain with you to make sure justice is served.\"\nThe only daughter of Marcell Oldham and Marquia Crosby, Makanzee loved to sing and dance, especially to \"Let it Go\" from the movie \"Frozen,\" according to her obituary. She was loved by her parents, was close to her cousins, and was found frequently carrying a pink blanket she owned since birth, the obituary read.\n\"Life without you is nonexistent,\" Crosby said in a statement in the program. \"You made me a better person, and I thank you for giving me the chance to become a great mom and loving me no matter what.\"\nLancaster and other clergy urged family and friends to use the tragedy to deepen their relationship with God and work to end violence in the community.\n\"We have to make up our minds that this violence has to stop,\" Lancaster said. \"When emotions are raised and when feelings are out of control, I'm going to ask you: Will you see her again?\"\nMakanzee was to be buried at Mt. Olivet Cemetery in Detroit."}
