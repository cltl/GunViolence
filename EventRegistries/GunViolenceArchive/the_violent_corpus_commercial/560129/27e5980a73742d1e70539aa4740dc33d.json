When she told the man she was not interested in him, he started firing into the car.\nA 3-year-old who was in the car was shot and remains in extremely critical condition.\n\"I'm just praying for her,\u201d Cardarius Benton said. \u201cAs crazy as it seems, that\u2019s how it is now.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like that is very sad and pitiful,\u201d Takerehara Smith said.\nSmith said she worried about the safety of her mom and other relatives who live in the area, but she simply couldn\u2019t believe an innocent toddler was shot.\n\u201cPolice or security guards should be over here 24/7, because there is no reason why a 3-year-old should have been able to get shot. Where is the protection over here?\" Smith asked.\n\"A lot of people don't have importance of life anymore,\u201d Benton said. \u201cThey don't have any reason to live. They ain't got nothing going.\"\nBenton said he is a rapper whose latest song is called, \u201cPut the Guns Down.\u201d The song is directed at people like this shooter. Benton hopes people realize there are better ways to deal with anger than pulling a trigger.\n\"All we can do it just pray and stay out the way,\u201d he said.\nNo arrests have been made.\nCopyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.
