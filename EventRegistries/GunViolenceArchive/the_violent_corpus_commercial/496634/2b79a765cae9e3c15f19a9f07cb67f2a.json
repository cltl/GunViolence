Two died 23-year-old Mark Womack and 22-year-old Errol Scott, known as 'Ro' to family and friends.\n'He had a smile that would brighten your day,' said Earvin Darby, Scott's friend. 'If you needed a laugh, he'd be there for you. He was the most loyal person you could ask for.'\nDarby said he and Scott were best friends who graduated Salmen High School together in 2010. He said it's heartbreaking to see his friend, with dreams of playing college football, be taken away so brutally.\n'It's a painful feeling,' he said. 'It's nothing that you can just get over with within a couple of hours, a month or a couple of years.'\nFriends tell Eyewitness News that Womack was a great guy who was very involved in his fraternity at Southeastern. He was home in Slidell visiting for the holidays.\nPolice believe Scott was the person the shooter was aiming for, and everyone else was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. They now have the assistance of the U.S. Marshal's to catch the killer.\n'We have identified potential suspects in this case,' said Slidell Police Chief Randy Smith. 'We are currently not releasing a name due to the sensitivity and the nature of this investigation.'\nFor loved ones, regardless of an arrest, there's a long way to go for closure.\n'This happened the day after Christmas,' Darby said. 'Every Christmas every body that love him is gonna think about this.'\nAuthorities say the other six victims are expected to recover."}
