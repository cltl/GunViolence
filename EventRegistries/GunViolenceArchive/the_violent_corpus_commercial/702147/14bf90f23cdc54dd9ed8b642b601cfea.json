Dan Montgomery of the Berkeley Police Department. A witness reported multiple shots fired just after 3 p.m., he said.\nThe conditions of the victims and where they were shot, was not immediately clear, Montgomery said, adding that they both were hospitalized.\nOne of the male teenagers involved in the fight pulled out a handgun and fired several times seemingly randomly into the crowd, a witness told police.\nNo arrests have been made in the shooting, and Montgomery said a motive was not immediately clear.\nMichael Bodley is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
