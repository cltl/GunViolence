Three suspects were arrested on Wednesday in connection to the sweet sixteen shooting.\nMiami-Dade Police charged 18-year-old Michael Melton, 18-year-old Dontavious Byrd, and 20-year-old Travonte Berry with Attempted Premeditated Murder with use of a deadly weapon.\nAround 10 p.m. Saturday, teens were celebrating a sweet sixteen birthday party at a home located at 20582 southwest 119 Avenue. All was fun and games until suspect Melton approached one of the victims asking, \"Are we gonna fight or shoot it out?\"\nTrying to avoid any confrontation, the victim walked away.\nAccording to investigators, Melton, along with Byrd and Berry, then jumped into a car and began to shoot into the crowd.\nUp to six minors were injured in the drive-by shooting. Their ages range from the youngest being just 12-years-old to the oldest being 17-years-old.\nAll of the injured teens were immediately taken to area hospitals - with four transported to Jackson South, one to Baptist Hospital in Kendall and the last airlifted to Kendall Regional.
