We need each other. We need our uncle, we need a brother, we need a sister. You can\u2019t go around taking people from people\u2019s families, because it does hurt.\u201d\nOne week after Davis, 19, and three other teens were shot while walking near 19th Street and Tamarind Avenue, dozens gathered to call for an end to the violence. Davis was killed Aug. 26 when a man in a car pulled up and opened fire on the group. Davis died immediately as the shooter sped away. A second teen later died at St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center. Two other teens were hurt but survived.\nDavis graduated a year ago from Forest Hill High School and was remembered for his intellect, his love of baseball and pulling occasional pranks.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, members of the community, city leaders and city police joined Davis\u2019 family for a peace walk and candlelight vigil. Dozens marched along Tamarind from Third Street to the spot on 19th Street where Davis was killed.\nDiane McNeil, Davis\u2019 mother, said she she was grateful to see so many people come out to honor her son.\n\u201cI love him and the one thing I can say is he was a good boy,\u201d she said. One man struggled to control his emotions as he remembered Davis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard getting through this,\u201d Davis\u2019 sister, Diane S. McNeil, said.\nEmmanuel Meant, 17, just became friends with Davis.\n\u201cWe became friends a couple of months ago and it\u2019s just tragic to see him die so soon,\u201d Meant said as he joined others in the walk. \u201cHe was a real good dude. He had had good intentions. He was trying to change the community.\u201d\nRicky Aiken, the founder of Inner City Innovators, a group advocating against violence among youth in the area, vowed that Davis\u2019 death will not be in vain.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to go on with business as usual as our young brothers are being slaughtered,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cWe have to come together. My hope for my community is that we can be a model, an example for every other inner city in our country.\u201d"}
