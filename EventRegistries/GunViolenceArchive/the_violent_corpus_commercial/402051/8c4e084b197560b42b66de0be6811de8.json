The teen talked to the commissioners about how to stop gun violence in the city.\n\"That man was full of potential. When I think of myself at that age, I think of Johnny and now he\u2019s dead,\" said Ricky Aiken who was a mentor to Johnny.\nAiken says Johnny was a part of his Inner City Innovators group which mentors children and young teens in the Tamarind community.\n\"He was just with us last week. He's not even involved with the system of violence. He's another me, one foot in, one foot out, he's trying to find himself in this community and the fact that he can be gunned down like this is terrible. It doesn't make any sense to me,\" added Aiken.\nAiken said he heard that the victims were just walking down the street and may have been shot in a drive-by shooting. Police have not confirmed that information. They have not released any suspect information.\n\"We can\u2019t continue to sit around hoping things will get better. It\u2019s going to take people from the community standing up and saying enough is enough,\" said Aiken.\nUpdated to clarify that the original story which mentioned two other people fleeing from the scene as a result of drug activity was reported in error."}
