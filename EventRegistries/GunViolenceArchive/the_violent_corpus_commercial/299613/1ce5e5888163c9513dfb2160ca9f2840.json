Authorities aren't sure how Codrick Beal found the gun in the home in the 1900 block of Imperial Stone Drive.\n\"It's just a terrible accident,\" Leticia Beal, a cousin of Ashley Beal, said in tears. \"We see it all the time on the news but you never think it'll hit home. It's the most horrible thing.\"\nThis is the second young child in Houston to die in an accidential shooting in as many days. A 3-year-old died Friday in northwest Harris County.\nThe Harris County Sheriff's Office and the constable from Precinct 4 were on the scene Sunday to investigate, but would not say what type of gun was fired or to whom it belonged.\nKeith Beal, an uncle of the mother, came to the house after receiving a phone call saying the boy, his mother's only child, had died.\n\"He was a loveable baby,\" he said. \"Very funny, he loved to play around all the time. He just had so much life in him, he was always a happy baby.\"\nEMS returned after noon to pick up the Beal's babysitter, who collapsed on the concrete road in front of her home, suffering convulsions as she sobbed in grief. Relatives on the scene said she was a long-time friend of Ashley Beal."}
