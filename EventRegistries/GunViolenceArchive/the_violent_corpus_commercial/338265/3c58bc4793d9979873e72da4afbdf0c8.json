John Porter.\nNo adults were home at the time of the shooting, which was reported to Trotwood police around 2 p.m. on Sunday.\nThe 5-year-old, who was not severely injured, was in the house with his two brothers, ages 15 and 11, at the time of the shooting.\n\u201cThey were kind of overseeing him, but he wandered,\u201d Porter said.\nPolice believe the 5-year-old found a Taurus semi-automatic pistol in a drawer in a bedroom and began playing with it when it went off.\n\u201cWe believe that he was either placing it into his pocket or trying to put it into his pocket, similar to a holster \u2026 like a cowboy. When he did, the weapon discharged, grazing the front of his leg,\u201d Porter said.\nThe 5-year-old was taken to Dayton Children\u2019s to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\nA woman who answered the door at the Mayview Drive address on Tuesday declined to comment on the incident when approached by a newspaper reporter.\nMontgomery County Children Services was also notified about the incident.\nThe woman faces the second-degree misdemeanor charge because she owns the firearm.\nPorter said this incident was preventable.\n\u201cParents should always ensure that the firearms are secured safely and that the children are aware of the rules and regulations,\u201d Porter said. \u201cGunlocks are appropriate and should be used, especially when the parents are not at home.\u201d"}
