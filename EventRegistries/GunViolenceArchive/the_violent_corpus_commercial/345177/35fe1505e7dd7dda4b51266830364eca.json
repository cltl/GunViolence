That\u2019s about a mile northeast of Clearwater.\nHe reported he was shot in the abdomen during a struggle with two burglars, according to the release. He originally was taken to the hospital in critical condition but has since been released.\nAt the time, he provided authorities with descriptions of the two burglars; authorities in turn asked the public for help in solving the crime.\nThe Sedgwick County Sheriff\u2019s Office will work with the District Attorney\u2019s Office to determine whether any further action will be taken in the case, the release said.\nReach Matt Riedl at 316-268-6660 or mriedl@wichitaeagle.com.
