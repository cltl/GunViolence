Police got the call about the incident around 11:50 a.m. Saturday (Jan. 17).\nThomas was transported to a local hospital, where he died.\n\"Detectives believe there was no intent,\" BRPD spokesman Don Coppola said. \"It was purely an accident as a result of them playing with this firearm. \"\nThe incident occurred at Edwards house on South Sunset Hill Avenue, just west of Airline Highway and south of Hollywood Street. It's unclear at this time who owned the gun, BRPD spokesman Don Coppola said.\nExactly a week prior to Saturday's incident, 20-year-old Demarcus Rheams was shot to death Jan. 10 in Baton Rouge by his 19-year-old friend, Jawan Billy.\nThe two were at another friend's garage in the 4900-block of Jefferson Avenue when the gun they were both looking at went off, striking Rheams. Billy, who was holding the gun when it fired, also faces negligent homicide charges. BRPD spokesman Cpl. L'Jean McKneely said at the time the Billy-Rheams shooting was accidental."}
