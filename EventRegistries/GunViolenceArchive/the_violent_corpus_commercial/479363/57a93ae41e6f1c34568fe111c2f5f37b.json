Greg Griego turned his life around after being in a gang.\nGriego reportedly served in Desert Storm, and Nehemiah told neighbors he wanted to be a soldier. He always wore army clothing and camouflage, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to play violent video games, according to one neighbor, since the boy\u2019s parents didn\u2019t allow anything \u201cdirty or violent\u201d and limited TV watching.\nUPDATE#1 (01/21/2013): The four remaining victims killed during Nehemiah Griego\u2019s shooting rampage identified as mother Sarah Greigo, 40, and his three youngest siblings Zephania Griego, 9; Jael Griego, 5; and Angelina Griego, 2."}
