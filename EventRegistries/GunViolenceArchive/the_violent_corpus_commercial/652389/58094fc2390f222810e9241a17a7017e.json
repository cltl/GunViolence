I live and also work here in the city of Dayton and my family lives here with me,\u201d Via said. \u201cThis is not indicative of who and what we are in the city of Dayton, this person is very dangerous.\"\nDetectives are hoping someone with information comes forward.\n\"We need to stand together, we need to draw a line and we need to hold people accountable, especially when they injure or try to kill the youngest victims within our society,\" Via said.\nIf you have any information on the shooting of a 4-year-old girl, you're asked to call Crime Stoppers at 222-STOP (937-222-7867)."}
