Holder, 19, after the Hamilton County Grand Jury handed down indictments of Felony Reckless Endangerment, Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor, Possession of a Prohibited Weapon, Unlawful Carrying or Possession of a Weapon, and Providing a Firearm to a Juvenile.\nHamilton County Sheriff's Office said the indictments came as a result of their investigation into the circumstances surrounded a 13-year old being shot in the face last month on Buck Trail in Harrison.\nPREVIOUS STORY: Investigators with the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office have determined that a 13-year-old was accidentally shot in the face by a family member while posing for pictures with guns.\nAccording to the Sheriff's Office, the firearms were illegally obtained. However, it's still unclear how the teens got their hands on the guns before the accident occurred.\n\"It's OK to take pictures with (guns), it's cool, it's society these days. But know what you're dealing with,\" said Kristi Manning, owner of Carter Shooting Supply. \"If you're gonna stand there and take a picture with it, don't stand there and take a picture with a loaded gun.\"\nManning spends a lot of time teaching adults and kids about gun safety here at the shooting range in Harrison.\nThe range is just a quarter-mile down the road from where a 13-year-old was shot in the face on Sunday. It happened at a home in the 6800 block of Buck Trail Drive.\nAccording to investigators, the teen was shot, on accident, by another family member before he was rushed to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\nManning says it's wise to always treat a gun as if it's loaded.\n\"(Age) ten, 12, 13, 18, 20, 30. It's all the same. It's safety,\" she said. \"(Guns) are not toys. They are deadly weapons if they wanna be used that way, and they can hurt you.\"\nShe says parents should teach their kids to always check if a gun is loaded first, and clear it, before pointing it in a safe direction.\nIf parents don't feel comfortable, they should leave the teaching lesson to a professional. The range offers gun safety classes for kids of all ages.\n\"If you just hide one in your house, or don't think your kid's ever gonna touch it, or tell your kid don't touch it, it's a gun. That's just drawing attention to it to make them wanna do it more,\" she said. \"It's safety and education. Education is the key factor on anything.\"\nAs of Wednesday, no charges have been filed. But the Sheriff's Office says the investigation is still open.\nPREVIOUS: A teenage boy continues to recover after being accidentally shot by a family member while posing for pictures with weapons.\nNew information from the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office says the firearms were \"illegally obtained\" but did not elaborate on how they were obtained.\nSpokesman J.
