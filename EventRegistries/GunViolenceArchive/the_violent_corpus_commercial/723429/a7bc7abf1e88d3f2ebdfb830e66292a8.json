Both of these young men were seniors in high school with so much opportunity ahead,\u201d Jennifer Briceno wrote in a Facebook post, adding, \u201cGrowing up in today\u2019s world is tough. Now, more than ever \u2013 it takes a village.\u201d\nOne resident of Serrano Apartments said Sunday that the shooting occurred next to her apartment in Building 6018. She had no idea about any dispute, except that the shooting occurred inside an apartment.\nKelly Francisque has lived at Serrano for four years.\n\u201cIt happened last night and they haven\u2019t told us anything,\u201d she said. \u201cMy kids are always at the playground here. This place used to be decent.\u201d\nAnyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-458-TIPS (8477).\nStaff writer John Pacenti contributed to this article."}
