She was home when the shooting happened, officials said.\nThe mother told police the shooting was accidental. Authorities said they changed their investigation after learning the Arkansas Department of Human Services previously investigated the mother. They said the DHS received reports of abuse.\n\u201cHe acted like my little brother, and I treated him like my little brother,\u201d said Madison Summers, a friend of the victim.\nPolice said the boy\u2019s mother told them her 11-year-old son accidentally shot the boy while playing outside with a shotgun. Authorities, however, said evidence found at the home doesn\u2019t match up.\n\u201cHe was one of our babies,\u201d said Pamela Hanna, Summers' grandmother. \u201cYou have a hole in your heart and you can\u2019t ever fill it.\u201d\nLeflore County deputies are investigating and are at the scene of the home now."}
