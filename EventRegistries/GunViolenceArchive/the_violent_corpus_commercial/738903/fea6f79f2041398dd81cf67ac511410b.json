Most neighbors chose to stay inside on the rainy day, which seemed to match the mood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been dreary and people have been protecting their kids and keeping them closer,\u201d said Vel Re Morgan, who lives in the area.\nBut it was a much different scene just days ago when police cars lined the street.\n\u201cThey was here for like five or six hours. They was in and out,\u201d Morgan continued, \u201cPeople went into cars and kids were taken. It wasn\u2019t nice. It wasn\u2019t a pretty scene at all.\u201d\nRonae Briscoe lives in the same building and witnessed the aftermath as well, \u201cI looked out the window just to see what was going on and I saw them bring her out on a stretcher. It was scary. It was very scary.\u201d\nAccording to sources with IMPD, a 3-year old got into his mom\u2019s purse while she slept and grabbed a gun. The boy then shot his 5-year old sister in the head, sources tell WISH. Crews rushed her to Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health where she is still fighting for her life in critical condition.\nThe investigation turns to their mother. Prosecutors will have to decide whether she was negligent in anyway. Morgan tearfully came to her defense.\n\u201cShe was a nice kid and her mom was an awesome mom. I don\u2019t understand what caused this or what happened, but she was an awesome mom. She was really protective,\u201d she said.\nAuthorities handed the case over to the Marion County Prosecutor\u2019s Office for review. We could learn as early as this week, what, if any, charges the mother will face.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
