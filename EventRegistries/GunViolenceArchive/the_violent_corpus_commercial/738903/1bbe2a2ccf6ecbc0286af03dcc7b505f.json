She passed away a few days later.\nPolice believe the shooting may have been accidental. They are investigating the possibility that the girl\u2019s 3-year-old brother may have grabbed the gun from their mother\u2019s purse while she was asleep and pulled the trigger.\nThe Marion County prosecutor\u2019s office has not yet made a decision as to whether the mother will be face charges.\nA similar incident occurred in April last year. A 2-year-old boy on Indy\u2019s northwest side found his mother\u2019s gun in her purse and fatally shot himself. The mother was later charged with neglect."}
