They arrived to find a 14-year-old boy laying in a wooded area in front of a vacant house with a gunshot wound to the torso. His father was there as well, by his side.\nSgt. Warren Pickard Atlanta Police Department said they have not located witnesses.\n\"The caller heard a gunshot, stepped outside their door and saw the child laying in the grass,\" he said.\nPickard said how the child was found is \"puzzling and concerning.\"\n\"The child's pants were down around his ankle, his shirt was off, so we don't know what happened here. The father lived close by and responded to the scene and found the child already down,\" he said.\nPolice said because the father was not at the scene when the shooting happened, he was unable to provide any significant information.\nThe victim was taken to the hospital breathing and conscious.\nAtlanta police K9's were canvassing the area looking for possible witnesses. No suspect has been identified at this time.\n(\u00a9 2017 WXIA)"}
