Walton says the shooter continued north on Highway 81 where he shot another person in the leg after stealing a vehicle.\n\u201cThere was a report of a stolen vehicle. That vehicle was the person that got shot. The shooter went on into Excel Industries. Once he got to Excel Industries, he shot a person in the parking lot, and he entered into the building itself,\u201d said Sheriff T. Walton. \u201cInside the building he shot a total of 15 people. Four were killed including himself, the shooter.\u201d\nWalton said about 150 people were likely in the plant at the time of the shooting, and that the law enforcement officer who killed the suspect \u201csaved multiple, multiple lives.\u201d He said the gunman had an assault weapon and a pistol.\nThe officer who killed the man is \u201ca hero as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Walton said.\nThe incident lasted approximately 26 minutes from start to finish. Walton said the FBI and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation had been called in to assist.\n\u201cWe have a team of KBI coming in. I have the FBI coming in. We\u2019ve got all the local law enforcement here, and this will take some time to work through this,\u201d said Walton.\nAfter the incident, Walton said officers had identified a house where the suspect lived. He said when officers attempted to enter the residence to conduct a search they were turned away.\nAfter a delay in securing a warrant to search the residence, officers discovered after 10 p.m. the residence the person who had turned them away apparently had left. Officers then entered the residence to conduct their search.\nOfficials are now working to identify all victims and notify their families.\n\u201cWe want to get the people who are so concerned that their loved ones have been shot or hurt. We want to get everybody identified, and we\u2019re working on that. We\u2019ll get that information out as soon as we can. I understand how hard it is for everybody else,\u201d added Walton. \u201cThis is just a horrible incident. \u2026 There\u2019s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.\u201d\nHesston is a community of about 3,700 residents about 35 miles north of Wichita.

Then the doors opened, people started screaming, coming out. Saying go to the front, go to the front, and then everyone turned around saying no he\u2019s out front and everyone started going to the back right over here. Then me my boss and the other employee we work with was just standing back there. We really just didn\u2019t know what was going on, and then everyone said there were gun shots and a shooter. We just kept hearing pop, pop, pop, and then this gentleman, I guess his name is Adam got shot.. I walked over and tried to help him as much as I could. He got shot twice in the chest, once in the arm, once in the leg. And I was just trying to help out the best I can. I mean I don\u2019t even work for Excel/ I work for a different gentleman. We come up to Excel to pick up pallets and what not. I just wanted to help out the best I could and do what I could for him.\u201d\n-Dylan, Eyewitness\nWhen I made it to the back parking lot, got to my truck and I was just panicking, crying, shaking, trying to get out of there because I didn\u2019t know if he was going to come after me, or if there was more than one or what. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n-Donna, Eyewitness\nI\u2019ve seen a bunch of people running. They were yelling fire and we just took off running. Everybody was coming outside. There were gunshots, and this one guy got shot in the leg and he was walking. One of the Apexes got shot four times. Four other people I know got shot. It\u2019s horrible. I had no idea what to do. We were hopping fences. Everybody was running, screaming. People were crying. We just didn\u2019t know what to do. They started off by saying fire. We heard the gunshots and it wasn\u2019t a fire.\u201d\n-Jordan, Eyewitness\nPHOTO GALLERY\nMAP OF MULTIPLE CRIME SCENES\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
