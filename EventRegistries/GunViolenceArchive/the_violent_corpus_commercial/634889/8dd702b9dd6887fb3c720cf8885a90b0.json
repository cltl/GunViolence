Her family was preparing to run a slide show on a large screen in a small yard in the courtyard of her Franklin Field apartment on Westview and Stratton streets. It was one of three barbecues in the courtyard that night.\nBut then, residents said, 14 shots rang out and four people were injured. One, a guest in her 20s, was shot in the back. The three others were not attending that barbecue.\nOne man and two women, with injuries ranging from \u201cnot so severe\u201d to \u201ccritical,\u201d were taken to the Boston Medical Center, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, according to Boston Emergency Services Lieutenant Gretchen Fox. The fourth person refused treatment, Fox said. The ages of the victims were unavailable. The call concerning the shooting came in at 11:45 p.m., according to police.\nAlthough the violence was the latest in a week that included a fatal shooting on Dudley Terrace around midnight Friday and a stabbing in East Boston on Wednesday that left a man dead, Boston police spokesman Michael McCarthy said this has been \u201cone of the safest summers on record.\u201d\nThe fatal shooting marked the 22nd homicide in Boston, a figure that matches the number of homicides for the same period last year, McCarthy said.\n\u201cThe commissioner has always said, one [shooting] is too many,\u201d McCarthy said Sunday. \u201cConsidering where other major cities are, we\u2019re experiencing some pretty low numbers.\u201d\nMcCarthy said the number of shootings citywide is down 25 percent and violent crime is down 6 percent compared to this time last year.\nBut the recent violence, he said, is still worrisome.\n\u201cIt is concerning anytime there is a shooting,\u201d McCarthy said, \u201cWe want to find out what happened.\u201d\nMcCarthy said the weekend shootings were not random and it is too early to say whether they were gang-related. Police said they have made no arrests.\nIn the shooting that left a 36-year-old man dead and a 31-year-old woman critically injured late Friday on Dudley Terrace, police say they are looking for a black man in a blue hoodie who ran from Dudley Terrace.\nNearly 24 hours later, residents at the Franklin Field apartments say, they were trying to enjoy the summer night when gunfire erupted.\nPeople scattered throughout the courtyard, darting into homes. Inside apartments, parents and children crashed to the floor for cover.\n\u201cI threw myself to the floor,\u201d said a 62-year-old resident, who was caring for several children inside her apartment at the time and declined to be named. Bullets struck the outside of her apartment, leaving holes in the red brick.\n\u201cI was so afraid it would go through the window,\u201d she said.\nA 43-year-old mother of three, who also declined to give her name, said the incident was especially traumatic for her 8-year-old son, who has autism. He stood in their apartment with his hands covering his ears as gunfire crackled throughout the complex.\nAfter it was over, the woman said, she saw four men fleeing, including one with a long gun.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d said Mercy Hutchinson, 34, a resident and mother of a 14-year-old boy and a 9 year-old girl, of the violence. \u201cWhen we are here, sometimes we are scared to come outside. . . . I\u2019m afraid something is going to happen.\u201d\nAt the barbecue birthday celebration, the hosts apologized to their guests for the violence.\n\u201cThis is how [my mother] will remember her 50th birthday,\u201d said a 27-year-old woman. \u201cWe were supposed to be having a good time.\u201d\nShe said she saw the sparks coming from the guns, but could not see the shooters.\n\u201cIt was very cowardly and disrespectful,\u201d said a 33-year-old resident who attended the birthday celebration but declined to be named for fear of her safety. \u201cIt makes me so mad.\u201d\nIn the East Boston killing, Darius Barry, 18, was arrested Friday in connection with the death of Gage Smith, 23. He is expected to be arraigned in East Boston Court Monday.\n\u201cThe safety and security of all Boston residents is our top priority, and we will continue to work diligently to bring peace to all parts of the city,\u201d Mayor Martin J. Walsh said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThis weekend\u2019s shootings are still under investigation and we encourage anyone with information to contact the Boston Police Department.\u201d\nAimee Ortiz of the Globe staff contributed to this report.
