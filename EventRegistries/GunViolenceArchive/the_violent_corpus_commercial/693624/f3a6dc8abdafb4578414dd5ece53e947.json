Broward Blvd.\nOfficers revealed little information about what happened as the investigation began its preliminary stages, including whether or not any suspects are in custody.\nOne of the victims is believed to be a security guard.\n\u201cHe got shot trying to provide for his family,\u201d said another security guard. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t justify the fact that there are people out there who shoot people. He never did anything to anybody.\u201d\nThe gunshots were loud enough to wake residents nearby.\n\u201cI was in my bed and we hear outside nothing but a whole barrage of shots. A whole lot,\u201d said George Davis. \u201cA lot of shots, man. A lot of shots. Like you\u2019re in the army.\u201d\nHe said the shooting came in several bursts minutes apart.\n\u201cBam-bam-bam, a couple of minutes you hear, slowed down again, then a couple more minutes you hear shots again, shots again,\u201d he said. \u201cI got up and look outside and see all the cops.\u201d\nThere was also a second crime scene at Broward Blvd and 27th Avenue, where a white Audi that was taking one of the shooting victims to the hospital stopped after making a U-turn. The driver saw an officer on a traffic stop and sought help.\nSequoia Chipp, who works at a restaurant near that scene, said, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. This is amazing. I am not from here. This is the first time I have ever seen something like this in Broward County.\u201d\nThree of the victims were transported to the hospital in unknown condition.\nAnyone with information should call Lauderhill Police or Broward Crime Stoppers at (954) 493-TIPS (8477). There is a reward of up to $3,000."}
