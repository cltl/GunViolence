She was airlifted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center where she is in stable condition.\nThe child\u2019s biological mother told Channel 4 she had just learned of the news and was in shock. She said the girl\u2019s name is Veronica and had lived with relatives for most of her life.\nSmyrna police have not said if any charges will be filed in this case.\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak on any charges,\u201d said Sgt. Bobby Gibson with the Smyrna Police Department. \u201cThe case has been turned over to the Rutherford County District Attorney\u2019s office for evaluation.\u201d\nGun safety advocates with the Safe Tennessee Project have been watching this story and others like it closely.\n\u201cThese are preventable tragedies. They should not keep happening,\u201d said Beth Roth with Safe Tennessee Project.\nAccording to Safe Tennessee Project, the state is ranked ninth in the nation for accidental shootings. It is also ninth in the nation for death by firearm, and third for shootings in or near a school, college or university.\nThis year alone there have been nine reported accidental child shootings. Two have been fatal.\nThe Safe Tennessee Project said they hope by presenting these numbers to lawmakers, they can help make better child access prevention laws, known as CAP laws.\n\u201cWe were recently flagged as one of seven states with a disproportionate number of accidental shooting,\u201d Roth said. \u201cAnd all seven of those states, including Tennessee, lacked meaningful child access prevention laws.\u201d\nParents and advocates hope to see fewer victims in the future.\nDepartment of Children\u2019s Services officials said they are investigating this shooting incident, along with local law enforcement.\n\u201cWhile we can\u2019t discuss children\u2019s and families\u2019 histories with the department, foster families and those who take custody of a child on an initial placement agreement must have weapons locked in safes and the ammunition kept separately,\u201d DCS said in a statement.\nRoth said Safe Tennessee Project plans to bring up Makayla\u2019s Law again next legislative session. It would criminalize parents who leave a loaded gun near a child under 13, if that child injures or kills himself or another child by firing the weapon.\nCopyright 2016 WSMV (Meredith Corporation).
