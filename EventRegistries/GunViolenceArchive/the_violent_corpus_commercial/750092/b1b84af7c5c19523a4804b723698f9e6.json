Officers \"rendered aid to the 10-year-old female juvenile victim until Carthage Fire (Department) and Mercy EMS took over,\" police Chief Greg Dagnan said.\nThe child was taken by ambulance to the hospital, and Carthage police said in a statement issued at 7:30 p.m. Friday that she was in critical condition. By 8:30 p.m., they had received word of her death, Dagnan said.\nDagnan said Saturday that \u201call the evidence and interviews we\u2019ve done so far point to\u201d an accidental shooting.\nThree minors of various ages were present in the home at the time of the incident; like most districts in the area, Carthage had closed its schools on Friday in anticipation of Winter Storm Jupiter. Dagnan declined to comment on whether any of the other children were involved in the incident.\nThe handgun involved originated in the home, but police have not yet determined to whom it belonged, Dagnan said.\nDagnan said his department will not release the girl\u2019s identity or the owner of the handgun until Monday, when he expects an autopsy to conclude that the death was a \"tragic accident.\" Dagnan declined to elaborate further on the circumstances of the shooting until the autopsy had been completed.\nThe department continues to collect evidence and interview people involved in the incident."}
