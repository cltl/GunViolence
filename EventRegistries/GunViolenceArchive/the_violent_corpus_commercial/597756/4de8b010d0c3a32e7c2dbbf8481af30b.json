The attack came during a protest in Dallas over the fatal shootings this week of African-American men in other states.\nKrol, 40, worked in Wayne County jails from 2003-07. He lived in Redford Township for a couple of years in the early 2000s, according to public records.\nSchoenbaechler and Krol\u2019s other family members gathered Friday at the Redford home of Krol\u2019s mother, Susan Ehlke.\nAn unidentified woman who answered the door said the family was overwhelmed and did not wish to comment.\nBut Schoenbaechler told The News it was Krol\u2019s dream to be a police officer. He said Krol moved to Dallas nine years ago because the city was heavily recruiting officers and the Detroit Police Department wasn\u2019t hiring at the time.\n\u201cHe was also a Detroiter at heart,\u201d Schoenbaechler said. \u201cHe really wanted to be a cop. That was his dream. That\u2019s the only reason he left.\u201d\nKrol wasn\u2019t married and didn\u2019t have any children, his brother-in-law said. He did, however, have a serious girlfriend in Dallas, Schoenbaechler said.\nSchoenbaechler, who lives in Atlanta with his wife, Amie, said the last time he saw Krol was in Metro Detroit at Thanksgiving, when the officer\u2019s girlfriend accompanied him.\nKrol is the third of four children from a close-knit family, he said. Krol\u2019s father, Frank, lives in Muskegon and was en route to Dallas on Friday, Schoenbaechler said.\nSchoenbaechler released a statement from Krol\u2019s mother.\nIt reads: \u201cHe was living a dream of being a police officer. He just turned 40 in April. He knew the danger of the job but he never shied away from his duty as a police officer. He grew up in Michigan. He was a Wayne County Sheriff\u2019s deputy and with the Dallas Police Department for nine years. He was a great, caring person and he wanted to help people. He was a wonderful son, brother, uncle, nephew and friend.\u201d\nSchoenbaechler said Dallas police Chief David Brown has been in touch with the family and \u201che\u2019s making (funeral) arrangements and will notify us when that\u2019s been worked out.\u201d\nLocal officials expressed their condolences to Krol\u2019s family, friends and colleagues.\n\u201cWe are saddened by the loss of the dedicated officers in Dallas \u2014 one of whom was a former member of this agency \u2014 and also the wounding of the other officers,\u201d Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon said in a statement.\nGov. Rick Snyder also issued a statement Friday about the fallen officers.\n\u201cMy heart is with the Dallas Police Department, the Dallas Area Rapid Transit police and the communities they serve,\u201d he said. \u201cI was notified today that one of the fallen officers in Dallas is a Michigan native who previously worked in law enforcement in southeast Michigan. We didn\u2019t need this tragedy to be brought home to feel its impact, but still it hurts more this way.\u201d\nRedford Township Supervisor Tracey Schultz Kobylarz said she didn\u2019t know Krol personally, but her community grieves along with the rest of the country for him and the other Dallas victims.\n\u201cI feel the pain as much as anybody feels this type of grief,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to deal with the shooting of a police officer anywhere in the country. And when you hear about the officer being from our hometown, it makes it that much more difficult.\u201d\nAs Krol was mourned in Metro Detroit and Texas, details began emerging Friday about some of the other Dallas officers who died in the sniper attack. Four of the officers killed were with the Dallas Police Department; the fifth was a Dallas Area Rapid Transit officer.\nBrent Thompson, 43, had worked as an officer with the transit authority for the last seven years. There he found love, marrying another transit officer within the last two weeks, according to DART Chief James Spiller.\n\u201cBrent was a great officer,\u201d Spiller told MSNBC. \u201cHe has served admirably during his time here at DART.\u201d\nPatrick Zamarripa, 32, was a Navy veteran who did three tours in Iraq, then returned to Texas and became a Dallas police officer. He was married with a toddler and a school-age stepchild.\n\u201cPatrick would bend over backward to help anybody,\u201d his father, Rick Zamarripa, said Friday. \u201cHe\u2019d give you his last dollar if he had it. He was always trying to help people, protect people.\u201d\ncramirez@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2058\nAssociated Press contributed"}
