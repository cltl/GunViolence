Ken Cox with St. Louis County Police says it started in Franklin County earlier in the day Saturday, when a warrant was issued for the arrest of Christopher Cadenbach, 43, on domestic violence charges in Franklin County.\nChristopher Cadenbach had spent the day with his sons, five-year old Ethan and four-year old Owen Cadenbach, and his own mother at a park. When they returned to a home in the 300 block of Rauhut in south St. Louis County, Cadenbach took the mother\u2019s car and the kids and left.\nCadenbach\u2019s mother contacted police and that led to the issuance of the Amber Alert.\nA St. Louis County Park ranger was closing Cliff Cave County Park around 8:00pm Saturday and noticed the car that was wanted by police and called authorities.\nThe County police helicopter was up, spotted the car, and saw someone moving towards it. Police officers responded and when they arrived, shots were heard. They believe that was when Christopher Cadenback was shooting his own children. Both boys were dead when police reached the car.\nThe officers then engaged Cadenbach and that\u2019s when Cadenbach reportedly took his own life.\nPolice are continuing to investigate the incident. Cadenbach was estranged from his wife.\nCliff Cave Park will be closed Sunday."}
