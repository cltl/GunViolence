He said he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to be taken alive\u201d and talked of \u201csuicide by cop,\u201d Cox said.\nCadenbach then left in the car with his children. Diane Cadenbach called police, who issued an Amber Alert for the children shortly before 7 p.m.\nShortly before 8 p.m., a St. Louis County park ranger spotted the car described in the Amber Alert in Cliff Cave Park in south St. Louis County.\nA county police helicopter then arrived, and its crew saw a man moving toward the car.\n\u201cHe was shooting his children,\u201d said Cox.\nCounty officers approached on the ground, and in a scene that Cox described as \u201cpitch black,\u201d exchanged shots with the man.\nCox said that Cadenbach apparently took his own life at that point.\nIt was \u201ca tragic and sad ending,\u201d Cox said."}
