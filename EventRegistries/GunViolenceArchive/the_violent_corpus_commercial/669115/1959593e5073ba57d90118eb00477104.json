We aren\u2019t going to exclude anybody or include anybody at this time. But once we know, and once we have the full display of the facts, we will deal with it accordingly,\u201d said Dougherty.\nJoin The Conversation On The KDKA Facebook Page\nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter\nPolice said the child was in stable condition after the shooting and transported to Children\u2019s Hospital as a precaution.\n\u201cIt does appear to be an accidental shooting,\u201d said Dougherty. \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding the mother was home. The father was at work. The mother was outside when the incident happened.\u201d\nNo word on when state police will wrap up their investigation, but when they do they will meet with Dougherty who will review their findings and make a final determination.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding the child is doing okay and these are not life-threatening injuries at this point,\u201d said Dougherty."}
