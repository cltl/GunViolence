I\u2019m trying to stay strong for my family but it\u2019s hard,\u201d said Alicia Shannon.\nHer son, Raheem Shannon, was shot about a block from his home in front of a convenience store off SW 216th Street and 120th Avenue Saturday night.\n\u201cThey was at the store and some guy came through, they say, shooting. He shot about like five people,\u201d said Shannon.\nAccording to Miami-Dade Police, five people were in the parking lot of David\u2019s Grocery around 11:15 p.m. Saturday when someone in a newer-model silver vehicle, with dark, tinted windows and missing the passenger-side mirror, drove by and began shooting.\n\u201cThe shooting woke me up,\u201d said the victim\u2019s sister, Verlicia Shannon. \u201cIt was loud.\u201d\nFive people ranging in age from 17 to 49 years old were struck. Two victims were rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital and three victims were transported to Kendall Regional Hospital.\nFamily members say 23-year-old Raheem Shannon, who was expecting his first child in five months with his girlfriend, died from his injuries.\n\u201cHe was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d said Alicia Shannon.\nSadly this is the second time this year this mother is burying one of her children. She says her 24-year-old daughter, Ebeny Nesmith, was shot near the same convenience store less than six months ago. There\u2019s been no arrest in her case and she\u2019s hoping tips from the public lead police to whoever\u2019s responsible for her son\u2019s murder.\n\u201cI want justice served. You need to come forward and do time for the crime you did. You took an innocent person\u2019s life,\u201d said Alicia Shannon.\nIf you have any information that could help police, contact Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS."}
