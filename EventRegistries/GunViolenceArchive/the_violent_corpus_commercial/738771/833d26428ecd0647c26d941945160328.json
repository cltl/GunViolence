The teen was found dead with a single gunshot wound.\n\"At this time, it doesn't look like a suicide,\" Cass said. \"There's a possibility that it could've been an accidental discharge.\"\nFamily members were in the home during the shooting, the investigator added, and relatives were taken downtown for questioning.\nThe gunshot wound was not necessarily self-inflicted, HPD spokesman Victor Senties said Sunday. No charges have been filed, but the investigation has not ended yet.\nA woman wearing plastic gloves and a mask answered the door at the family home Saturday afternoon in the working-class residential neighborhood. The woman, who said she was a relative, was cleaning up the home before the parents returned.\nThe woman said the girl's parents were still talking with Houston police and had not had a chance to notify friends as of noon Saturday. They might try to organize a vigil in the girl's honor when students return to school next week, she said.\nA neighbor down the block said she didn't know the family but remembered when she saw teens practicing a quincea\u00f1era dance in the street -- perhaps preparing to celebrate the 15th birthday of the girl who died Saturday.\nNote: This story was updated to clarify that police have not said who fired the weapon.\nbrooke.lewis@chron.com\nandrew.kragie@chron.com"}
