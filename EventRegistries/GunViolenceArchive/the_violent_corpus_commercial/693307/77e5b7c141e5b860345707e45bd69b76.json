John Walker of the Southwest Detective Division said.\nThree teenagers who were shot and wounded are believed to have been the intended targets, Walker said.\nThe shooting occurred in front of Wanda's Lounge on the 5500 block of Springfield Avenue at about 9:20 p.m. Friday. Walker said police did not have any suspects and the shooting was not caught on surveillance video.\nWhen police arrived outside the bar, they found the older man and a 17-year-old boy shot and wounded, Walker said. Police took both victims to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center in critical condition. The teen was hit by a bullet that entered his shoulder area, went across his back and through his spinal cord, Walker said.\nWalker said the two other shooting victims - both 18-year-old males - were taken to hospitals in private vehicles.\nOne, who was shot in the left foot, was taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was treated and released.\nHe told police he had been outside Wanda's with two of his friends - the other teenage shooting victims - when he heard gunshots, took off running, then realized he was shot in the foot, police said. He said he stopped an unknown person, who drove him to HUP.\nThe other 18-year-old, who was shot in his left arm and foot, was taken to Penn Presbyterian by a man he knew in the neighborhood. He was listed in stable condition Saturday.\nThe driver who took him to Penn Presbyterian had a gun in his vehicle and immediately told police he had one, Walker said. Police determined this man has a permit to carry a gun, which was not used in the shooting, Walker said. The man was released after being questioned by police.\nTwelve shell casings from two guns were found at the scene.\nWalker said it wasn't yet clear who was firing guns outside Wanda's on Friday night, and police were not aware of the motive behind the shooting.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the police tip line at 215-686-TIPS (8477).\n215-854-2592 @julieshawphilly"}
