Dustin Ray Mow, 34, was arrested on suspicion of possessing a weapon as a previous offender.\nAccording to an arrest affidavit for Mow, he told police he was attempting to show his fianc\u00e9e how to clean her pistol when it fired through his hand. Mow told police he was taking the pistol apart and forgot to clear the chamber when a bullet went through the palm of his hand and into the ground.\n\u201cThis injury appeared to be consistent to one who used two hands to remove the slide from the hand grip of the pistol,\u201d the officer wrote in the affidavit. \u201cThe injury also appeared to look as if the palm was covering the muzzle of the pistol while attempting to remove the slide from the hand grip.\u201d\nMow received medical attention for his injury and subsequently was arrested. Mow had a felony conviction from 2008 on contributing to the delinquency of a minor and was prohibited from having guns, the affidavit said."}
