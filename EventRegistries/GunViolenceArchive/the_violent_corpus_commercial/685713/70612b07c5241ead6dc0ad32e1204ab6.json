Jeremy Butler, 20, and Katelyn Butler, 14, were shot to death.\nWilliam Butler, 46, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the release said, which added \"several weapons,\" including a knife and a shotgun, were found inside the home.\nGrief counselors were dispatched early Wednesday to Choctawhatchee High School, where Katelyn was a popular student, said Henry Kelley, spokesman for the Okaloosa County School District.\nPolice responded to the Pryor Road home following a 5:45 a.m. report of domestic violence. They found the bodies inside.\nPhillip Rose, who lived next door to the Butler family at 9 Pryor Road, said that a fifth member of the family, a 17-year-old boy, fled from the home to another residence, where a neighbor called 911.\nA call report states the teen that fled the home told the neighbor who made the call \"he heard screaming and yelling at his house.\"\n\"Mother, father, brother and sister are home at 11 Pryor \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 (the teen) was awoken to things breaking and yelling - he left the house, jumped through several back yards to find help,\" the report states.\nThe dispatcher, quoting the boy, then said, \"parents have fought before, seems 'weird' this time.\"\nWithin 10 minutes of receiving the call, police officers had made contact with the boy who'd fled the home and arrived at 11 Pryor Road, the call report states. One officer reports \"someone lying down on the inside - no movement.\"\nJust seconds after the first body is reported, the officer reports a second body on the ground and decides to make forced entry into the residence.\nThe little white home where the Butlers resided for about a year had become both a memorial site and source of curiosity Wednesday morning. Several people drove slowly past and one, Belinda Ramsey, stopped to set a small wreath of autumn leaves next to a teddy bear and balloon left on the walkway leading up to the front door.\n\"I'm praying for everybody,\" she said.\nWhile most of the Butler's neighbors said the family kept to themselves, Rose said he had befriended \"Billy\" Butler, and to some extent, the sons, who he said were extremely polite and helpful.\n\"I'm still in shock,\" he said Wednesday morning. \"I was here when it all started, then at 4 p.m., when they started rolling bodies out, I had a horrible feeling come over me.\"\nRose said he thought Butler had taken to him because he knew he was involved in a church ministry called Operation Recovery.\n\"There were times he'd come over and spill his guts,\" Rose said.\nButler spoke often of trouble in the home, and blamed his wife for the turmoil, Rose said.\n\"He was trying to keep peace at the house for the kids,\" Rose said. \"The bottom line was, he loved his kids.\"\nRose said Butler told him that at one point his wife had left him. After she returned, he said Billy's mood soured.\n\"The last couple of days, Billy didn't look happy at all,\" Rose said. \"I finally said, 'Billy, what's wrong, you don't look happy at all?' and he said, 'I'm dealing with that same stuff again.' \"\n\"He was talking about going back home,\" Rose said, though Butler never mentioned where \"home\" might be.\nRose, who spoke to the Daily News before police identified Butler as the killer of his family, said he would find it hard to believe his friend could murder his children.\n\"As much as he told me he loved his kids, I couldn't imagine him killing them,\" he said.\nSuzanna Faagau, who lives in Anchorage, Alaska, recalled a recent incident at the Butler house that she said left her with a strange \"feeling of foreboding.\"\nThe home at 11 Pryor Road, Faagau explained in an email, was where she'd grown up.\nFaagau said she was in Fort Walton Beach three weeks ago when she decided to take her son and grandchildren to see the house.\n\"I knocked on the door. A man of about 35-45 years old answered the door. He wouldn't open the door all the way, he asked me what I wanted and I told him I wanted to show my children the house I grew up in and asked if it would be OK to walk around the yard. He very quickly said 'no' that he was in the shower,\" Faagau said.\n\"I had the strangest feeling that he was trying to hide something by the way he kept the door as closed as possible,\" the email said. \"I left with a feeling of foreboding and even mentioned it to my son how strong the feeling was.\"\nFaagau said her mother contacted her Tuesday following the murder-suicide.\n\"I am in shock to say the least and deeply saddened,\" she said. \"It is so strange to see my childhood home in the news for such reasons.\""}
