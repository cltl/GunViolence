Flowing with liquid courage, the murderous man instead showed up around 5:30 a.m. Saturday at his gal pal\u2019s Springfield Gardens home, where he methodically executed 7-year-old daughter Kayla and badly wounded her 12-year-old sister, Christina.\n\u201cHe wanted to kill the two kids because he didn\u2019t want them in foster care\u201d after he killed their mom, a source said.\nWalker then went to another bedroom and fatally shot Hale, 31, and her mother, Viola Warren, before committing suicide in his parked car at JFK Airport.\n\u201cHe destroyed a whole family,\u201d said Hale\u2019s cousin Joseph Simmons. \u201cThere are no words to describe how angry the family is. He is a loser. He is a coward.\u201d\nChristina survived the rampage and managed to dial 911 to explain her father\u2019s barbaric deed. She even opened the door for first responders.\nRelatives said Christina is in a medically induced coma and undergoing intensive care following surgery that involved cutting open her skull to ease brain swelling.\n\u201cThe doctors are hopeful,\u201d said the girl\u2019s uncle, Silford Warren. \u201cThank God the bullet passed through the part of her head that it did. She moved her head backward at just the right moment when [her father] fired and that probably saved her life.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Kevin Sheehan"}
