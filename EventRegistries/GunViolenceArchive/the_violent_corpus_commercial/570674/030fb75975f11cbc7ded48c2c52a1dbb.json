He doesn't have a lawyer yet.\nCourt documents show authorities went to a hospital where a shooting victim had been dropped off for treatment and later died.\nBarron reportedly was a back seat passenger in a car in which the victim was shot.\nHe told police that the gun's upper receiver was locked and the safety on after his friend had manipulated it.\nBarron says when he attempted to put the weapon's receiver back into the right position, the safety moved to the fire position and the gun accidentally went off.\n\u00a9 2016 The Associated Press.
