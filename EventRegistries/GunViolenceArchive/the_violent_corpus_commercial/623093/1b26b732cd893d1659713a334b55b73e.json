He ran across the road to a convenience store.\n\"He walked out of the store, and you could see on the surveillance camera a boy confronted him,\" his mother, Trameka Brown, said Sunday (Aug. 7). \"A boy talked to him, and then it happened.\nIt was there, outside LaPlace Discount, 820 W. Airline Highway, that Horton was fatally shot Friday afternoon. Brown, who identified her son as the victim, said he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that the two people who confronted him at the store were interested in retaliation against another person whom they all knew. She did not say who they were targeting.\nHorton was preparing to enter 10th grade at East St. John High School on Monday. He was a member of the school's cross country team, running two-mile races, Brown said.\nWounded, the victim went back inside the store, where someone called 911, the St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff's Office said Friday. An Emergency Medical Services unit took him to a local hospital, where he died. The Sheriff's Office has not released any new information since then.\nAnyone with information on the crime was encouraged by authorities to call the Sheriff's Office 985.359.8477 or Crimestoppers Inc. at 504.822.1111. Crimestoppers callers need not testify in court to qualify for a cash reward. Tips also may be submitted online at the Sheriff's Office website.\n. . . . . . .\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect date for when Horton was to begin 10th grade."}
