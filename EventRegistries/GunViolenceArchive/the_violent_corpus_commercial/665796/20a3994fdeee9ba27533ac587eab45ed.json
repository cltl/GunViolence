Jeffrey Pratt with Altoona Police Department said.\nOfficers responded to reports of shots fired on the 1600 block on 2nd Avenue early Thursday morning.\nOfficers said Corle fled the scene and hid the gun near Pleasant Valley Elementary School after the shooting. Police said after they caught up with Corle, Corle led them to the gun.\n\"The chances of us were remote because it was in a most unlikely place covered by 3-inches of dirt and a rock,\" Pratt said.\nHowever, police said the public was never in any danger.\nCallan's friends are planning a candlelight vigil outside of his home Thursday night.\n\"He was the life of the party. He was really fun and outgoing and really goofy,\" Audrie Coble, Callan's former neighbor said.\nCorle is facing charges of involuntary manslaughter."}
