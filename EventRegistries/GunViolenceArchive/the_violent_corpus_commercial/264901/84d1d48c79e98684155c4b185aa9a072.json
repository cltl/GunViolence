(WABC) --\nActivists in Elizabeth are calling for a response after violence erupted outside a community center.\nFour people were shot outside the Mickey Walker Community Center on Anna Street about 10:30 Tuesday night, a half hour after it closed.\nInvestigators say 2 Elizabeth men (ages 24 and 21) and two Newark men (ages 25 and 30) were standing in the vestibule when they were approached by three men in black hooded sweatshirts and dark masks. The three suspects brandished at least two handguns and opened fire on the men, striking all four. The suspects then fled on foot in an unknown direction.\nAll four victims were transported to U.M.D.N.J. Hospital where 2 were listed in stable condition and 2 in critical condition.\nThe reward through Union County Crimestoppers has been upped to $10,000 for information leading to arrests and convictions. Tips can be given anonymously by phone at (908) 654-TIPS (8477), via text message by texting \"UCTIP\" and a message to 247637 (CRIMES), or online at www.uctip.org.\nCommunity leaders will call upon the city's mayor and police department to establish a division of violence prevention and intervention, said Salaam Ismial, Director of the National United Youth Council.\nThere have been no arrests and no word on the motive behind the shooting. Employees said Wednesday morning that they don't recall a similar incident at the center which is supposed to be a safe place for teens.\nThe center offers a variety of program for teenagers Monday through Saturday."}
