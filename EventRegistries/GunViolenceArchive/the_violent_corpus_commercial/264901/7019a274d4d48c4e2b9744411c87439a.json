At least two of the three suspects had guns.\nAll four men were hit at least once, and the gunmen ran from the scene.\nWitness Fabrice Juin said he heard about six or seven shots while he was inside his home.\n\"It sounded like a shot gun, just straight bullets,\" Juin said.\nThe victims were all taken to University Hospital in Newark. One sustained serious injuries and the other three are in stable condition.\nNo arrests have been made.\nCrews were at the center, which houses a gymnasium and playground, patching apparent bullet holes in the center's doors on Wednesday.\nFernando Rodriguez, who works at the nearby Rally Autobody, said the neighborhood is no stranger to violence, so he wasn't surprised to hear about the shooting.\n\"It just surprised me because there are young kids inside there,\" Rodriguez said.\nAnyone with information on the gunmen is asked to call the Elizabeth Police Department at 908-558-2050.\n-- Sheldon Dutes contributed to this report."}
