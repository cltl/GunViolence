One woman knelt and sobbed over a large blood splatter that remained on the sidewalk.\nRelatives originally identified the man as David Hopper, and said the girl was his niece.\nThe girl was identified as Zariah Muhammad by the Tribune. Zariah and her uncle were having a water balloon fight with family members when a man spoke to her uncle before shooting at him, according to the Tribune.\nZariah, whose father was paralyzed by gunfire five years ago, was supposed to have surgery on Friday, according to the Tribune.\nShe was grazed in her head, said Officer Laura Amezaga, a Chicago Police spokeswoman. Jeff Lyle, deputy district chief with the Chicago Fire Department, said she was taken to Comer Children's Hospital, where she was listed as \"stable.\"\nNo further information was available, police said.\nWhile many neighbors said the block was relatively quiet and didn't attract much criminal activity, Melvin Jones saw things differently.\n\"I don't go around no corners, I don't talk to people. I just stay at my place and hope none of this s--- finds me,\" said Jones, who lives around the corner in the 300 block of East 68th Street. \"It's f---ed up around here. We can't go to no suburbs, we're in the middle of it. We live in it, we sleep in it.\"\n\"I wish [the police] would just send some cars to sit up on this block and keep watch,\" he added, saying that his nephew had been shot to death earlier this year.\nIt has been a particularly brutal summer for Chicago's children.\nMonday night, 10-year-old Tavon Tanner was critically wounded in a shooting outside of his home in North Lawndale. On July 19, 6-year-old Tacarra Morgan was shot while outside her home on a sunny afternoon. Also last month, a 4-year-old boy, a 5-year-old girl, a 7-year-old boy and an 11-year-old boy were shot in separate incidents across the city."}
