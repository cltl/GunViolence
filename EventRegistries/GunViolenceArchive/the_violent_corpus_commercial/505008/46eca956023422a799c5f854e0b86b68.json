She was shot and killed on Valentines Day when, according to Battle Creek police, her boyfriend was cleaning his gun. They said they believe the case to be accidental. But now the it's in the prosecutors hands.\n\"We\u2019re looking into how much responsibility does a firearm owner have to make sure that firearm is safe to where it won\u2019t go off or it won\u2019t be an incident like this that takes place,\" said Detective Sergeant Troy Gilleylen with the Battle Creek Police Department.\nInvestigators said they've conducted multiple interviews with the boyfriend, 25-year-old Deangelo Gaines. Gaines initially told them that his .45 caliber gun went off when he was cleaning it. But then he said the gun was lying on the bed when Babick laid on top of it. When she tried to move it, it discharged.\n\"The firearm was left out, loaded obviously,\" said Gilleylen. \"What we\u2019re now looking at is whether or not someone\u2019s careless acts contributed to the death of a human being.\"\nGilleylen said there are no laws stating a gun has to be locked or stored away when it's inside a residence. However, the department is looking into whether it was reasonable to have it out in the open.\n\"She wasn\u2019t taking the gun apart when it went off,\" said lead detective Scott Silverman. \"She wasn\u2019t cleaning it when it went off. She wasn\u2019t playing with it when it went off. She was actually on the telephone talking to her mother.\"\nDue to a number of interviews with Gaines and other witnesses, police believe the incident to be unintentional. But it is a peculiar case.\n\"For an adult I think it is unusual,\" said Gilleylen. \"I know we do hear on occasion of a child that\u2019s able to get a hold of a parent or firearm that\u2019s left out. And I think that it happens all too much.\""}
