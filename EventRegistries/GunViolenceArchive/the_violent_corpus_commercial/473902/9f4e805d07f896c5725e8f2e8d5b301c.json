Westley was unloading a .45 ACP Springfield Armory tactical handgun he had used earlier that day while coyote hunting. \u201cI was checking to make sure it was unloaded,\u201d Westley, 17, told the Times. \u201cI pulled it out of the holster, and it went off.\u201d\nThe hollow-point bullet went through the calf of his left leg, tearing through his jeans and rubber boots and exiting above his shin.\nStunned by the blast but charged with adrenaline, Westley jumped out of the truck and ran to Sage McGinnis, 18, a first responder with the Gainesville Volunteer Fire Department, who was sitting in his truck in the same parking lot.\n\u201cNow I can\u2019t put any pressure on my leg at all, but right after it happened, I ran to Sage, and he got it wrapped up and called the ambulance,\u201d Westley said Monday night.\nHe was taken to Baxter Regional Medical Center in Mountain Home, Arkansas, where a small army of friends and relatives converged on the trauma center as Westley was being treated there.\nHis mother, Jama Berry, hurried to the hospital from the family\u2019s home near Brixey, as did Westley\u2019s grandparents, Gainesville residents Mark and Rhonda Suter. His maternal grandmother, Kay Doubek, and sister, Kirsten Suter, waited anxiously back home in Brixey for news that he was OK, Westley\u2019s mother said.\nIn the hospital, x-rays revealed Westley\u2019s amazing luck: the bullet had not hit a bone. A couple of small pieces of the bullet remain in the tissue of his leg, but no surgery was needed. The entry and exit wounds were treated, his leg was wrapped and Westley was issued a pair of crutches and sent home to recover, pausing just long enough in the trauma center hallway for a photo with friends and relatives who had gathered there.\nHis Facebook post reporting the accident and thanking everyone for their prayers and text messages \u201cand for being there at the emergency room\u201d garnered dozens of get-well wishes and expressions of thanks that his injuries weren\u2019t worse.\nJama Berry told the Times, \u201cWe are definitely blessed\u201d that he\u2019s going to be OK. Responding to one Facebook commenter\u2019s post that \u201cyou learn from your mistakes,\u201d Jama replied, \u201cLet\u2019s hope he does. I\u2019m not sure how many more lessons my heart can take.\u201d"}
