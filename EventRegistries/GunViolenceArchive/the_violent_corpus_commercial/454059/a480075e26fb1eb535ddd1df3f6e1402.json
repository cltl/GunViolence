Our loss cannot be expressed in words. While the nation now knows Garrett as a hero who gave his life for others, he was also a devoted husband of 17 years and a wonderful father to his two children. His greatest joys were his family, his church, and his profession. We will cherish his memory, especially those times he spent tossing the football to his son and snuggling with his daughter on the couch.\nGarrett was born in Melrose, Massachusetts. After a successful career in ice skating, Garrett found his calling as a police officer. Helping others brought him deep satisfaction and being a police officer was a part of him. In the end, his last act was for the safety and wellbeing of others and was a tribute to his life. What we need most today, and in the coming weeks, is your prayers for our family and for others who were impacted by this tragedy. We are grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love that has come from the community and across the nation.\nWe understand this is a public tragedy felt by many and we also appreciate your support for us to grieve privately.\n___________________________\nUPDATE 11/28 8:30 p.m.: Students, faculty and numerous members of the community gathered on the UCCS campus Saturday night to hold a vigil for Officer Garrett Swasey.\nSwasey was a six-year veteran of the university's police force.\n\"He knew, he knew the risks and he loved what he did. He dedicated himself to being here, he dedicated himself to this profession,\" UCCS police Chief Brian McPike said.\nUCCS also held a moment of silence at their basketball game Saturday afternoon.\nA memorial fund set up for Swasey exceeded $68,000 Sunday morning.

They're in pretty good spirits, and my hope is for the most part, most of them get released today. I'm absolutely blessed that more officers weren't killed yesterday.\"\n(Suthers, in response to the same question): \"I was incredibly impressed meeting with the officers this morning. They were all alert; some of them have a little longer path to recovery than others. Their major concerns are about their comrades. You can just feel they want to get out there, and they'd do it all again in a heartbeat.\"\n(John Walsh, Colorado attorney general, praising law enforcement): \"There was extraordinary courage and determination shown yesterday by first responders on the scene, who in all likelihood prevented a much greater loss of life.\"\n(Suthers, in response to question about protecting other potential targets in Colorado Springs) \"An incident of this nature can take place in any city in the United States. It behooves us to make sure we have as good a first response capability as possible. As I watched the situation unfold yesterday, there was not an iota of doubt in my mind that we have incredibly well-trained first responders...just as we responded very capably to this incident, we are capable of responding to other incidents. We periodically meet and talk about what our vulnerabilities are, and we plan for those.\"\n(Carey, in response to a question about whether he had been made aware of any threats to Planned Parenthood prior to Friday) \"I know we've had prior conversations with Planned Parenthood, as is the case with many of our bigger organizations in the city. They work with the Colorado Springs Police Department to develop site plans and some suggestions we give them to make their place safe. I don't know of any specific threats that I can discuss right now for that organization, but we've had some conversations in the past with them and other big organizations and buildings in the city.\"\n__________________________\nUPDATE 11/28 1 p.m.: Colorado Springs Police Chief Pete Carey outlined the police department's top priorities going forward in the investigation.\n\"First and foremost is to take care of the victims of this horrible tragedy. ...

He expected that to be Monday.\n\"I finally want to say how proud I am of our first responders,\" he said before relinquishing the mic to the other officials for a media Q and A. \"The Colorado Springs Fire Department; police department; literally another dozen or two other agencies, big and small, that came out yesterday afternoon...some are still on scene. It was just amazing to see that. When you have things like a Waldo Canyon Fire, a Black Forest Fire, a tragedy like this, a distinction of why we're Colorado Springs is I don't have to ask for that. They've already come out, they're already rolling their sleeves up and helping out.\"\n________________________\nUPDATE 11/28 12:52 p.m.: Gov. John Hickenlooper refused to say the alleged gunman's name while addressing media over Friday's shooting.\nHis focus was on the heroes and victims--one and the same in many instances.\n\"Situations like this show the country is filled with heroes who want to protect their neighbors,\" Hickenlooper said. \"Incredible beauty here in the Springs exaggerates joy in joyful times and sorrow.\"\nHickenlooper said the state was united behind Colorado Springs and El Paso County.\n\"It's a tragedy beyond speech...I spent a lot of time last night trying to figure out how things like this can occur.\"\n______________________\nUPDATE 11/28 12:45 p.m.: \"The city of Colorado Springs is in mourning today,\" Mayor John Suthers said while addressing media Saturday at a joint news conference with Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\"We're in mourning over the deaths of three people, including one very brave police officer. ... We mourn the injuries to citizens and police officers alike.\n\"But we are also very thankful today for the incredible work of the first responders, particularly the SWAT teams, who handled themselves incredibly well. In my opinion--and I was in the command center watching this all unravel--they saved many, many lives yesterday.\"\nSuthers said he had fielded calls from the White House Saturday offering their support, and that agencies such as the state attorney general's office and the FBI were on the ground in Colorado Springs to help with the investigation.\n_______________________\nUPDATE 11/28 12 p.m.: \"Our hearts break together for what happened,\" said Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains President and CEO Vicki Cowart, addressing a full house at All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church.\n\"All of us, our entire nation, community, was attacked.

What we do know is that he killed a cop in the line of duty, along with two of the citizens that police officer was trying to protect. We know that law enforcement saved lives, as so many of them do every day, all across America. And we know that more Americans and their families had fear forced upon them.\nThis is not normal. We can\u2019t let it become normal. If we truly care about this -- if we\u2019re going to offer up our thoughts and prayers again, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience -- then we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them. Period. Enough is enough.\nMay God bless Officer Garrett Swasey and the Americans he tried to save -- and may He grant the rest of us the courage to do the same thing.\n________________________________\nUPDATE 11/28 5 a.m.: Springs police released a mugshot of the suspected gunman in the Planned Parenthood shooting.\nThough the name was floated around hours earlier, law enforcement officially identified the alleged shooter at this time as 57-year-old Robert Lewis Dear.

It's unclear if the suspect was injured when he surrendered.\nAuthorities did not release the suspect's identity, but reiterated that the gunman was alone.

And I kept thinking, 'Is that gunshots?'\"\nTo her horror, a moment later she saw a man stagger out of a car, riddled with gunshots.\n\"I was watching over to the Planned Parenthood area, and I saw a car and I see somebody leave and somebody go inside with a bag. I didn't think a whole of it, but then I watched this car...it kind of drifted from the driveway over at Planned Parenthood across to that little road in between that and the next building...it kind of went up a little hill, kind of drifted back. I knew watching it that there was no one steering that car.\n\"It came to a stop as it rolled backwards...a guy got out and fell to the ground. You could see all the gunshots.\"\n________________________\nUPDATE 4:35 p.m.: Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers is currently at the shooting scene, working with law enforcement.\nKing Suthers', where 150 people have been locked down for almost five hours, says it is providing everyone there with food and drinks.\n_________________________\nUPDATE 4:18 p.m.: Gov.
