Reports say the witness, friend Armonte Tolbert, told police that Hunter fell, prompting Frazier to run, then shoot himself.\nThe 17-year-olds were pronounced dead about 30 yards apart. A .32-caliber revolver was in Frazier's hand.\nTolbert, who held Hunter after the shooting, says the teens \"had no beef with each other.\" He said he'd known Frazier to make suicidal comments in the past.\n___\nInformation from: Kalamazoo Gazette, http://www.mlive.com/kalamazoo"}
