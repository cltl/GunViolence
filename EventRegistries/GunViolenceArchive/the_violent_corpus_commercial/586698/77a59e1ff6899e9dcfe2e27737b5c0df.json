We have a 20-month-old child who has been shot and killed in our city and it is difficult to make sense out of that.\u201d\nDyer provided a chronology of the events leading to Rashad Jr.\u2019s murder:\nIt was a warm summer evening and a number of people living at the complex, along with friends, were sitting on and around an electrical box and milk crates. Rashad Halford Sr., 28, was sitting on the box and Rashad Jr. was leaning on his dad. Then, Rashad Sr. saw a man in a black hoodie walking toward him. (The man might have walked past previously, Dyer said.) As the man came closer, he pulled the strings on the hoodie tighter, presumably to obscure his face.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked, before pulling out a handgun and firing at least 10 rounds at Rashad Sr., who fell to the ground. Rashad Jr. and Willis Mucelroy, 42, also fell. Rashad Sr. then pulled his wounded son to his chest and held him before passing him to his mother.\nAll three were rushed to the hospital. Rashad Jr. died several hours later. His father, who was hit by several bullets, remains hospitalized, as does Mucelroy.\nDyer said the gunman is African American, standing about 5-foot-10 and weighing 200 to 215 pounds. He had an Afro-style haircut and was wearing jeans and white shoes.\nThe chief said the shooting might be gang-related and added that Rashad Sr. had gang connections when he was a juvenile. Dyer said he spoke to Rashad Sr. at the hospital and believes he has changed his life as an adult.\n\u201cNo family deserves this,\u201d Dyer added.\nAs for the gunman, \u201cIt was very apparent that he knew there was a baby present,\u201d he said.\nFor police officers, Dyer said \u201cthere is as sense of personal responsibility\u201d about the shooting, \u201cand we take it extremely hard.\u201d\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (559) 498-7867, where a reward of $3,000 may be awarded for information leading to an arrest.\nJim Guy: 559-441-6339, @jimguy27"}
