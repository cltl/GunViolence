Another man in the home was wounded.\nKitsap County sheriff's investigators questioned Dejesus, a former boyfriend who had a child with Kelso, shortly after the murders. Kelso had taken out an order of protection naming Dejesus after the two broke up saying she feared for her safety.\nInvestigators said they didn't have enough evidence to arrest him until early Thursday morning\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that (we had) all the available information that we could, all the evidence that we could,\u201d said Kitsap Sheriff\u2019s Office Lt. Earl Smith.\nTrammell said the arrest of a suspect is a relief, but doesn't change the fact his son is gone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to know they got him,\u201d said Trammell. \u201cBut it\u2019s still not going to bring Kaden back, it\u2019s not going to bring Heather back.\u201d"}
