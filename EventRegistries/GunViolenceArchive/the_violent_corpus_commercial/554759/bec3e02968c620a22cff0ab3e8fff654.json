The victim's grandmother said her granddaughter was getting ready for bed and said the apartment is home to five children. We went there to learn how the little girl was recovering.\nThe victim's grandmother declined to be interviewed on camera, but told us we could share what she told us about her granddaughter.\n\"She's resting. She's home. She's ok.\"\n\"She's out of the hospital. She's doing better.\"\nMinneapolis Police say multiple shots were fired and the bullet, that hit the little girl, came into her home, through the wall. The victim's grandmother said, \"They were going to bed, and when they heard the shots, they tried to run.
