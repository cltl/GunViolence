He was taken to Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta in critical condition, but his current status is unknown, Cpl. Michele Pihera, a police department spokeswoman, said.\nPolice said the boy took the .40 caliber Smith and Wesson handgun, which police later learned was stolen from Marietta, to his friend's home near Harbins Road. The weapon was stolen June 24, 2016, according to police.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to work hard to figure out exactly how this teen gained access to the weapon,\u201d said Cpl. Deon Washington, a police department spokesman. \u201cAt this point we\u2019re just hoping that he survives this injury.\u201d\nPolice said the teens, who live in the same neighborhood, were sitting on a sofa where Albayero-Rodriguez was playing with the handgun and it fired at his head. Others were at the house in different rooms including children between the ages of 5 to 16, police said. Someone called 911 and tended to the victim until paramedics and police arrived shortly before 6 p.m.\n\u201cA gunshot wound to the head is very serious, especially when it involves a child,\u201d Washington said at the scene at 1413 Wingfoot Way.\nPolice said once the boy was shot, his friend picked up the gun, tried to unload it, and fired another round. That\u2019s when the boy dropped the weapon, Washington said.\n\u201c(The teen) did not live at the home, and the adults that live here had no knowledge of a firearm being inside of the home,\u201d he said.\nAlbayero-Rodriguez's parents were notified and joined him at the hospital.\n\u201cThis is a serious reminder of how important it is to keep firearms out of the hands of children. \u2026 This was merely a horrible accident,\u201d Washington said.\nPolice do not expect to charge the two adults, Washington said."}
