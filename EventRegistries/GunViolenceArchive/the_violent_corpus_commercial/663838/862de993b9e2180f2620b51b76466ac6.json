I was just standing there, and finally when I reacted I was trying to help him out so he wouldn't die,\u201d he said.\nTRENDING STORIES:\nThe boy then tried to pick up and unload the gun, and in doing so it accidentally fired again. No one was hit by that shot.\nPolice said Rodriguez brought the gun over to his friend\u2019s home.
