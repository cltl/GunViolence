He was transported to the hospital in critical condition.\nInvestigators said the teen was playing with a handgun at his friend\u2019s house when it discharged and struck him in the head. The teen was transported to Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, where he is listed in serious condition.\nOfficials said after the shooting, the victim's 15-year-old friend, who was sitting near him, picked up the handgun and attempted to unload it. He also fired the handgun, but no one was harmed by that shot. There were two adults inside the home who were able to call 911 and get medical instructions from the call taker until the ambulance arrived.\nAt this time, investigators don't believe the adults knew that the gun was in their home. As such, no charges were expected.\nOfficials said the 40 caliber Smith and Wesson handgun was between June 19 and 23 when the gun's owner in Marietta noticed it was missing, but they do not have indication of how the teen gained possession of it. Regardless, Cpl. Michele Pihera with Gwinnett County Police said the outcome remains tragic.\n\"These people are teenagers, probably in middle school, so it's certainly something we don't want to have happen.\""}
