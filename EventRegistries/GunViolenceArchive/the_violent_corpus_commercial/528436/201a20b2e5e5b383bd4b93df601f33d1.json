Where was the parent? Where was the gun at?\" asked resident Cynthia Terry.\nAll questions Memphis police are working to get answered.\nTerry is shaken up over the news an 11-year-old girl was shot just two doors down from her apartment.\nTerry says her son had been outside playing with a few kids, including the victim, earlier in the morning.\n\"Was out earlier this morning playing with these same children that got shot this morning. It could've been my son. It's horrible,\" said Terry.\nTerry is not only shaken up over the shooting, she's mad and says there's no excuse for what happened.\n\"If you\u2019re supposed to have a gun in your house, it's not supposed to be nowhere where a child can find it, period,\" said Terry. \"My son, he come out here every day and want to play. And I feel like if I'm going to keep him huddled in the house. Then it's not a place for us to be.\"\nShe wants to know how kids had access to a gun and who was supposed to be watching them.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
