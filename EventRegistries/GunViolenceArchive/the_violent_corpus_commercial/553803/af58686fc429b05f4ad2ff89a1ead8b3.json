Marcus Hines said in a news release.\nTwo of those shot were seriously wounded and four were treated and released. Two other men had minor cuts from broken glass, Hines said later in a telephone interview. Investigators don\u2019t know the motive or whether the gunmen took any money, and don\u2019t have leads to their identities.\n\u201cThese guys were in there playing cards. Whether they were gambling or not has not been determined,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t find a gambling shack and money all over the place. It wasn\u2019t that kind of scene,\u201d Hines said later in the interview. \u201cWe found people shot and suspects gone.\u201d\nPolice identified the dead victims as Elton Wayne Madison and Leatrick Benjamin, both 37.\nAlthough the incident was described at first as a shootout, Hines said police did not find any guns in the tire shop or any evidence that any of the gunmen was shot.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if there was an exchange of gunfire or not. It may ultimately end up being an exchange,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys came in and started shooting. No one reports they shot back.\u201d\nHines said he did not know whether the two men cut by glass were trying to get out through a window, whether the gunfire broke glass, or whether there was broken glass in the shop for some other reason."}
