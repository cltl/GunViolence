She died at the scene, officials said.\nThe man who owned the gun, 42-year-old Dale Weston, ran off after the shooting and was still being sought by authorities Friday, officials said.\nThe tragedy began shortly after 6 p.m. as Willis visited the 18-year-old sister of Weston\u2019s girlfriend, who lived at the apartment, police sources said.\nAs the two girls hung out in a room, Weston came in, showed them the .40-caliber pistol and then left the weapon in the room when he was called away, the 18-year-old told police.\nWhen the doomed teen picked the gun up to look at it, staring straight down the barrel, it went off, the teen told police.\nAt least three adults, as well as some children, were in the apartment but in other rooms when the gun went off, police sources said.\nIn the confusion, Weston, who has been arrested more than 20 times stretching back to 1990, mostly for robbery and drug offenses, fled the building.\nThe gun also disappeared \u2014 and police believe Weston took it with him, sources said.\n\u201c(Weston) is a bad guy,\u201d building superintendent Rafael Garcia, 30, said in Spanish. \u201cHe leaves garbage on the floor. He screams, speaks nasty at the children.\u201d\nMembers of an NYPD Strategic Response Group were interviewing tenants and scouring for evidence both inside and outside the apartment building Friday.\nWillis\u2019 family said the teen was an exceptional Tipico dancer \u2014 a dance style that hails from Panama.\n\u201cShe had a beautiful spirit and it showed when she danced,\u201d her cousin Sara Gray, 22, said. \u201cShe loved to dance more than anything.\"\nOn Friday, the family remained in the dark over what happened, Gray said.\n\u201cZion's mother and our whole family would like to know what really happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would like the truth.\"\nWeston is described as approximately 6-foot-3 and 190 pounds with brown eyes and short brown hair. He was last seen wearing a black waist-length jacket and blue jeans, police said.\nAnyone with information regarding his whereabouts is urged to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.
