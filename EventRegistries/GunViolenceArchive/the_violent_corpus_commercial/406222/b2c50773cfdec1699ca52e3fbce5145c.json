His name has not been released.\n\"Are you surprised that would happen?\" Channel 9 reporter Karla Ray asked resident David Cintron.\n\"Not at all,\" Cintron said. \"Not in this neighborhood.\nSmith was charged with aggravated battery with a firearm and unlawful discharge of a firearm and also has a violation of probation for trespassing, investigators said.\nHe was taken to the Orange Regional Juvenile Detention Center.\nPrevious Story: Teen hit by stray bullet while sitting on porch of Pine Hills home"}
