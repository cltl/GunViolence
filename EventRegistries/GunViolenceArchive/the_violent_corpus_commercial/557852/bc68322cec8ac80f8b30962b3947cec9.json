Medics said Thursday that he was shot in the head.\nIn a 911 call, the boy\u2019s grandmother told the operator that her grandson had accidentally shot himself in the head. But police couldn\u2019t immediately confirm whether that was the case Thursday, telling NBC4 it was still an open investigation.\nPolice said when they arrived to the house, they found the grandmother giving Fraley CPR. An officer assisted her in giving CPR. Fraley was taken to Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nAngie Ely\u2019s daughter Kearsta was a friend and classmate of Fraley\u2019s at Scioto Darby Elementary School. Ely said Fraley wanted to be a videogame designer when he grew up.\n\u201cCertainly very emotional for anyone involved and it\u2019s just a tragic situation,\u201d Hilliard Police Chief Robert Fisher said.\nJames Webster, who lives down the street, said his nine-year-old daughter goes to the same school as Fraley.\n\u201cIt hits home,\u201d Webster said. \u201cIt does, because I mean, it could have been her just as easily. She could have been down there playing or whatever.\u201d\nAcross the street, Richard Harden said he didn\u2019t know the family but often saw the children playing outside.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy for them, and of course I feel sorry for the grandmother and the family and of course I feel sorry for the little boy,\u201d Harden said.\nPolice say there\u2019s no risk to the public and no person of interest in mind. Still, the investigation continues.\n\u201cYoung kids are smarter than you give them credit for,\u201d Harden said. \u201cSo, someone\u2019s got to be to blame there. Someone\u2019s got to be to blame.\u201d\nIn a letter to families Thursday evening, Scioto Darby Elementary School principal Tamar Campbell-Sauer wrote:\nDear Scioto Darby Families,\nIt is with a heavy heart that I inform you that Colin Fraley, one of our fifth grade students, passed away today. According to the Hilliard Police the circumstances are still being investigated.\nWe are all deeply saddened by this event. Please take this opportunity to inform your student about this situation and share any information about your family\u2019s personal beliefs and preferences related to Colin\u2019s passing. Death is a difficult topic for many adults and also children handle this stress in a variety of ways. It is natural for them to ask questions or to display behaviors such as:\n\u00b7 clinging close to adults;\n\u00b7 displaying regressive behaviors;\n\u00b7 repetitively re-enacting the event in play activities;\n\u00b7 appearing not to be affected;\n\u00b7 thinking about it privately;\n\u00b7 appearing frightened, agitated or angry;\n\u00b7 experiencing difficulty sleeping; and,\n\u00b7 complaining of stomachaches or not feeling well.\nIt is important to listen to your child, help them understand what has happened and return to normal every day activities.\nWe are currently working out details to support students, staff and families during this difficult time. We will have counselors available should students or staff need additional support. While each of us will handle this news in a different manner, it is important that we are supportive of each other as we return to a normal routine.\nPlease keep Colin\u2019s family in your thoughts and feel free to contact the school office if needed.\nSincerely,\nTamar Campbell-Sauer\nScioto Darby Elementary School Principal\nKeep checking NBC4i.com for real-time updates on this story.
