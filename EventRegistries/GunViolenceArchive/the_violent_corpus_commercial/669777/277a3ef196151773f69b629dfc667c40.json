That group was outside and there was a shooting between one group and apparently that (first) group returned fire,\" Harrison said.\nHe added that the department doesn't yet know \"if this is about two individuals or if this is about groups or gangs or how they may be connected. Or if this is connected to something else that happened previously,\" Harrison said.\nThe shooting took place in the 3700 block of Ulloa Street about 9:25 p.m. Officers who responded to reports of the shooting found three people suffering from gunshot wounds. One was pronounced dead at the scene and two others died later at a local hospital, NOPD said.\nThe Orleans Parish Coroner's Office identified the fatal victims as Darome Hilton, 34, Glenquel Emerson, 20, and Bobbie Basquine, 22.\nTwo other victims who were injured arrived at a hospital by private vehicle, police said."}
