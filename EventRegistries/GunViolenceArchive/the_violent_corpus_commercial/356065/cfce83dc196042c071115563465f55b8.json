Eight other people were wounded, including a 59-year-old grandmother who was hit by a bullet in the buttocks while she was in the shower in her home nearby.\nMayor Bill Finch held a press conference later Thursday morning at the scene.\n\u201cOur heart goes out to the people involved and to their families,\u2019\u2019 Finch said. \u201cWe are outraged. This kind of thing is just senseless. But we have made progress and we have the lowest crime rate in 40 years.\nStanding on the sidewalk near where Finch was talking, Police Union President Charles Paris told a different story.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for the city of Bridgeport,\u201d Paris said. \u201cWe need to step up patrols in the area. We are short and we need help. The mayor says crime is down but the shootings are way up, and they need to address that.\u201d\nFinch promised better security at the large North End housing project, and said the Safe Corridors program, which puts security cameras on children\u2019s walking routes to school and buses, would be expanded to Trumbull Avenue.\nBut residents said the mayor\u2019s promises were too little, too late. Mayoral aspirant Joseph Ganim took advantage of their complaints, campaigning just yards from Finch\u2019s press conference.\nThere had been about two dozen people in the parking lot about 1 a.m., sitting on car hoods and enjoying the night. Music was playing.\n\u201cThe kids were just out here chillin\u2019, having a good time,\u201d said the woman who witnessed the shooting. \u201cAbout 24 people were out smoking blunts, drinkin\u2019 Hennie and chillin\u2019.\n\u201cI was just talking to Vahnnie \u2014 I\u2019ve known him since he was a baby. He wanted to see some glasses I was selling, his last words to me were \u2018Let me see those shades.\u2019 \u201d\nThe witness, whose name is being withheld, said, \u201cAs I was showing him the glasses, this girl Blaze asked me for a cigarette. Music was going on, everybody was having a good time. And then this young guy came by me with this gun. I heard him say, \u2018Kill everyone.\u2019 There were these pop-pop-popping (sounds) and I went on the ground. Vahnnie got shot in the head and Blaze fell on top of Vahnnie and played dead. This one boy emptied his clip and told the other boys, \u2018Don\u2019t leave no witnesses.\u2019 \u201d\nPolice Chief Joseph Gaudett said that \u201cat least two shooters, wearing hoodies\u2019\u2019 fired shots at the group of people standing in a parking lot, and then ran away. Gaudett said that he couldn\u2019t confirm that the people who were shot had gathered for an outdoor party, and he wouldn\u2019t say what type of guns were used.\nThe identities of the wounded \u2014 five men and three women \u2014 have not been released. Most of the victims, who ranged in age from 27 to 59, suffered non-life-threatening wounds. One woman was shot in the stomach, but was expected to survive.\nBruce Nelson said his 32-year-old son, Bruce Jr., was one of the victims.\n\u201cHe was shot in the hip,\u201d the elder Nelson said. \u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital, and they are going to have to put a rod in his leg.\u201d\nNelson said his son dove under a car when the shooting began.\n\u201cLiterally dozens of detectives are following leads, interviewing witnesses and visiting area businesses to determine if security video exists that will bring us closer to finding these gunmen,\u201d Gaudett said. \u201cInvestigators are working nonstop and won\u2019t rest until we identify these gunmen and bring them to justice.\u201d\nPolice are investigating a dispute in Norwalk that might be related to the shooting.\n\u201cWe have developed leads that we are pursuing, but we need the community\u2019s assistance,\u201d Gaudett said.\nKenneth T Jones, a Trumbull Gardens resident, said he grew up in the complex with McNeil. He said McNeil worked as a barber and for a kitchen cabinet installer, and had several children.\nJones and a man with him, who declined to give his name, said they believe young men from \"across town\" did the shooting.\nThere is a 2-foot gap in the chain-link fence at the back of the Trumbull Gardens. People who live there call it \u201cthe hole.\u201d\nA resident named Gloria has been watching the hole from her living room window for nearly a decade. When she sees young men coming through it from Sunshine Circle, she said, she knows something bad is going to happen.\nJust after midnight Thursday she said she saw \u201cA boy with a gun,\u201d coming through the hole.\n\u201cThe hole is always going to be there,\u201d said Karen Bracey, president of the project\u2019s residents association. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it used to be when the boys would come through the hole and sell drugs on Trumbull Avenue. Now this is a different group of children who come in here cause they feel they need to establish street cred.\u201d\nKenny Jackson, a member of Streetsafe Bridgeport, a grassroots initiative that hires community members, responded to the shooting scene.\n\u201cWe are from these neighborhoods. We know the people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve walked the same path that a lot of these kids are on. We\u2019ve been there so we can relate to them and they can relate to us.\u201d\nWith nearly 400 units, Trumbull Gardens is one of the Bridgeport Housing Authority\u2019s largest properties.\n\u201cIt is spread out,\u201d said Housing Authority Executive Director George Lee Byers. \u201cIt has elderly in the high-rises there. It also has single-family and multi-family housing units. It\u2019s pretty diverse.\u201d\nByers said Trumbull Gardens does have security cameras.\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know if those cameras captured where this particular event took place,\u201d he said.\nFinch asked for help from the community to prevent future shootings.\n\u201cI realize that is no consolation to the victims today,\u2019\u2019 the mayor said, occasionally glancing down at his notes. \u201cThe vast majority of people here in Trumbull Gardens get up in the morning and go to work, and send their children to school. I urge parents to talk to their young men and tell them to put down the guns.\u2019\u2019\nStaff writers Brian Lockhart, Daniel Tepfer and Digital News Editor Jim Shay contributed to this story."}
