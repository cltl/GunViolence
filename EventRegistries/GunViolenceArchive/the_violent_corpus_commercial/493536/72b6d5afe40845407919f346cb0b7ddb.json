The Seattle Times said a police source said the shooting was the result of a dispute between people who knew each other.\nPolice were called to the shooting just before Mayor Ed Murray began his live address regarding the state of emergency in Seattle for homelessness.\nLast fall, Murray declared the civil state of emergency because of the growing number of homeless people in Seattle and King County.\n\"We believe this is a targeted shooting. We have persons of interest we're looking for.\" Chief O'Toole. pic.twitter.com/BHSQEz7IQ3\nIn response to the timing, at a conference Tuesday night, Murray said, \"I can't help but wonder, did I act too late? ... Maybe I should have issued the state of emergency months earlier.\"\nThe reasons for #homelessness are complex and ending homelessness will not be solved easily or quickly. There are no simple solutions.\nThe shooting is the largest in Seattle since May 30, 2012 -- the Cafe Racer shooting.\nIn that incident, five people died and one person was injured.\nIn an SPU shooting on June 5, 2014, one student was killed and two other students were injured.\nSPD reminded me--anyone camping out in the jungle is trespassing.SDOT Property pic.twitter.com/9CWBhjdm8V\n\u2014 Gary Horcher (@GaryKIRO7) January 27, 2016\nAbout The Jungle\nThe property, which is owned by the Seattle Department of Transportation, has been a notorious camp where people have lived for three decades.\nThe city tried to remove people who were living in the camp in 2012, but many stayed.\nThe Jungle has a history of violence.\nIn June of 2009, 55-year-old Bernardino Maceo-Toirac was shot multiple times in the wooded area.\nOn July 22, 2009, Warren J. Bothwell\u2019s death was the second 2009 homicide for The Jungle.\nBothwell, 45, was found dead at the scene. Police got a call around 12:30 a.m. and found him with a chest wound.\nNo charges were filed in either of the 2009 homicide cases.\n\u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group."}
