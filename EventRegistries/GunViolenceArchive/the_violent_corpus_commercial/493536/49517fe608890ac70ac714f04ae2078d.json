Assistant Chief Robert Merner said the shooting at the longstanding encampment didn\u2019t appear random: \u201cWe have reason to believe it was very targeted.\u201d\nTwo men apparently carried out the 7:15 p.m. attack at an area known as The Jungle, another source said, adding that police were interviewing witnesses to confirm that as they searched for suspects.\nOne woman was dead at the scene, and a man died at Harborview Medical Center. A man and a woman were in critical condition and one woman was in serious condition, and all were in surgery Tuesday night, a hospital spokeswoman said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t speculate, but we\u2019re hopeful\u201d they will survive, said Harborview spokeswoman Susan Gregg.\nBy 7 a.m. Wednesday, the two critical victims had been upgraded to serious condition.\nThe victims, ages 25 to 45, had gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen and back.\n\u201cWe have no reason to believe anyone else is in danger at this point,\u201d said police Chief Kathleen O\u2019Toole. \u201cWe have some very good leads,\u201d and homicide detectives were interviewing several witnesses, she said.\nPlay VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:00Loaded: 0%Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:00Playback Rate1\nChapters\nChapters\ndescriptions off, selected\nDescriptions\nsubtitles off, selected\nSubtitles\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\ncaptions off, selected\nCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreen\nThis is a modal window.\nCaption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

There is no simple answer.\u201d\nMurray said the Jungle has been \u201cunmanageable and out of control for almost two decades\u201d and that the city would launch an assessment of the encampment in the next two days.\nPlay VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:00Loaded: 0%Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:00Playback Rate1\nChapters\nChapters\ndescriptions off, selected\nDescriptions\nsubtitles off, selected\nSubtitles\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\ncaptions off, selected\nCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreen\nThis is a modal window.\nCaption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

He said the men and women who live in the encampment are like \u201ca community.\u201d\nUnable to access his tent, Martinez, who has been homeless for two years, said he would try to find a shelter bed for the night.\nPolice have conducted sweeps of the Jungle in the past, often in response to complaints from neighbors.\nTuesday\u2019s shooting marked the second fatal attack at a Seattle encampment in the past five months.\nLast August, a homeless woman was beaten to death under the Magnolia Bridge and her husband was attacked, as the two ate in their tent."}
