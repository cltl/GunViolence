Investigators in a small Florida town worked Sunday to determine what led a longtime trucking company employee to go ona shooting spree that left the man, his former boss and a former coworker dead \u2014 and two others wounded.\nAllen was a long-term employee of Pritchett Trucking, reports CBS affiliate WTEV in Jacksonville. The president of the company says he retired two weeks ago, while others claim he was fired.\nAs police worked to find a motive, the Sheriff's Office was sure of a few things. The shooter, Hubert Allen Jr., 72, is the step-grandfather of Buffalo Bills running back C.J. Spiller. He also worked hand-in-hand with people in the community and never showed signs of such a violent act.\n\"To tell you the honest truth. I never seen an angry bone in his body. Something must have just made him went off on him. We're looking at that and trying to figure out why,\" Union County Sheriff Jerry Whitehead said. Whitehead is victim Marvin Pritchett's nephew.\nAllen drove to several locations around Union County Saturday, including the headquarters for Pritchett Trucking Inc. and shot the men Saturday, according to a Union County Sheriff's Office news release. It added that authorities believe Allen acted alone.\nAuthorities said Allen shot and killed former co-worker Rolando Gonzalez-Delgado, 28, around 9 a.m. Saturday, then went a short distance and fatally shot his former employer, 80-year-old Marvin Pritchett.\nA few minutes later, he pulled over where another former co-worker was driving a farm tractor, exchanged words with him and then fired one shot from a shotgun, authorities said. That victim, 66-year-old Lewis Mabrey Jr., was in good condition as he was preparing to undergo surgery for a broken arm and other injuries, according to officials.\nNot long after that, Allen went to the company's headquarters in Lake Butler and shot 44-year-old David Griffis in the stomach, the release said. Griffis was in critical condition. Authorities said Allen then returned to his nearby home and killed himself.\nWith a population of about 2,000, Lake Butler is located about an hour's drive southwest of Jacksonville. Authorities said he was a longtime employee of the trucking company.\nInvestigators were working at the five shooting scenes and interviewing witnesses and company employees. The sheriff's statement said they were working to determine a motive. The sheriff's office also called in investigators from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to help with the various shooting scenes.\nThe trucking company's website said it employs 400 people and owns hundreds of vehicles that operate around the country. It said Pritchett started the trucking company in 1980.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with all of their families, and at this time our sole focus is on those impacted by today's events. Words cannot express the pain and sorrow felt by so many yet we are comforted by the memories of those lost,\" the company said in a statement.\nThe company's chief financial officer, Steve Perez, didn't respond to an email seeking further comment.\n\u00a9 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.
