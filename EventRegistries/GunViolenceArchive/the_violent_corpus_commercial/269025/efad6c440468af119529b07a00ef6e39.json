The Fayette County coroner reports that Russell died on after 2 p.m. Friday at University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital.\n\"Everybody was there celebrating Christmas there at the end of Christmas night, and that's when this terrible, tragic accident occurred,\" said Major Rob Warfel of the Frankfort Police Department.\nPolice said Dnomyar was somehow shot in the head, and emergency crews rushed the boy to Frankfort Regional Medical Center. He was then flown to UK Hospital.\nPolice have not said how Dnomyar was shot. They said their investigation is ongoing, but an initial investigation determined the shooting was accidental.\nThey say anytime people have guns in a house, they have to treat them with care.\n\"Anytime there's a loaded firearm in the house, there's the potential there for danger. You should always, if you're handling a firearm, always handle it as if it were loaded even if you think that it isn't,\" Warfel said.\nFuneral arrangements have not yet been scheduled."}
