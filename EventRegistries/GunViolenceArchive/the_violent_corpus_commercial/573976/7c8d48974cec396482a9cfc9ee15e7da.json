North Chicago police Sgt. Freddrick Diez said it was unclear if the injury was a graze wound from a bullet or if the girl fell down and scraped her leg.\nParamedics took the child to an area hospital for evaluation and treatment, according to the release. She returned home Tuesday afternoon, police said.\nResponding officers also found a 19-year-old man shot in the leg in the 900 block of 13th Street, Diez said. That man, who lived on the block, was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, according to the release.\nInvestigators also located a gun hidden under a vehicle in the 900 block of 13th Street, according to the release.\nOfficers located and detained suspects possibly involved in the shooting, according to the release.\nThe shooting prompted nearby Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in North Chicago to issue an email alert to faculty and students. The email said police \"advised there is no threat to the university.\"\nInvestigators are interviewing possible witnesses, victims and those taken into custody, according to the release. No charges have been filed as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\"The North Chicago Police Department does not believe there is any remaining risk to residents in the area as a result of this incident,\" according to the police release.\nOne North Chicago resident, who identified himself as a writer named \"Block Life,\" said the area is so violent that he doesn't like to bring his son over to visit his sister.\n\"Kids live in every building up and down this block. It's terrible. You can't even have your kids outside,\" he said.\nHe added that he believes North Chicago officials have done a nice job of reducing violence throughout the city, but that area remains dangerous and needs more police patrols.\nNorth Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham said Tuesday that he believes North Chicago is a safe place and the police department does a good job patrolling the city.\n\"They do everything possible to keep our citizens safe,\" Rockingham said. \"What has really helped to (curb) a lot of the situations in our community is the support of the citizens in reporting the incidents that are happening and they give detailed reports on what is going on.\"\nHe said the department has increased patrols in different areas of the city and is increasing its interactions with the public by doing more foot patrols.\n\"We are trying to interact with a lot of residents through programs such as the Citizens Police Academy,\" he said. \"That has helped because it has given the residents an opportunity to interact closer with our police department and that gets out into their neighborhoods to inform residents of how our police department has built a better cooperative with the residents.\"\nTwitter @MEKColeman\nTwitter @MeganAsh_Jones\nA version of this article appeared in print on June 08, 2016, in the News section of the Chicago Tribune with the headline \"2 hurt in North Chicago shooting - 3-year-old girl, man injured; cops find gun under vehicle\" \u2014 Today's paper | Subscribe"}
