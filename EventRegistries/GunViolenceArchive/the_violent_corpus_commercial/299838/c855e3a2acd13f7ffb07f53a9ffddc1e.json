Greg Ellison of the Delaware County Sheriff's Department said the 31-year-old victim was taken by ambulance to IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital for wounds to his groin. His injuries were not life-threatening.\nEllison said the man -- who lives in the house where the shooting was reported, in the 500 block of North Northwood Drive -- had been showing his 17-year-old nephew how to use the shotgun. The teen was trying to unload the weapon when it fired, he said.\nThe accident was reported to 911 dispatchers about 1:20 p.m. The dead-end road - north of Ind. 3,2 west of Delaware County Road 800-E -- became jammed with emergency vehicles in the immediate wake of the incident, thanks in part the weekend's heavy snow.\nDelaware County EMS and emergency personnel from Parker City and Liberty Township were also at the scene.\nContact news reporter Douglas Walker at (765) 213-5851.
