Clementa Pinckney and then wildly began shooting people attending a Bible study at Emanuel AME Church, according to Kevin Singleton, who said he spoke with the oldest survivor of the shooting. His mother, Myra Thompson, was among the nine killed Wednesday.\nSingleton said he was told that Roof, 21, then allegedly tried to kill himself -- but he had run out of bullets.\n\"He put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger but there was just no bullets left,\" said Singleton. \"I'm assuming he wanted to take his own life.\"\nRoof was apprehended in Shelby, North Carolina, about 250 miles away from the church. He has been charged with nine counts of murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.\nA website surfaced Saturday that allegedly revealed disturbing views about race in addition to dozens of photos believed to be of Roof, including one of him holding a gun and another of him holding a Confederate flag. According to sources, the site was believed to be legitimate, but authorities, including the Charleston Police Department, are working to confirm its authenticity.\nAshley Pennington, a public defender assigned to Roof, has not responded to ABC News' request for comment.\nStanding outside the church for the first time since the shooting, Singleton reflected on his mother's strength.\n\"What I'm going to miss most about my mom is her enthusiasm and her just undeniable faith in the world to succeed,\" he said. \"I miss her a lot and I love her very much. She's a very strong, strong woman. It's just a lot.\""}
