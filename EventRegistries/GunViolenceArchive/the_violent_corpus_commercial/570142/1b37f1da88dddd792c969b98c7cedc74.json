She said she saw the girl drifting in and out of consciousness.\nShe grabbed her car and drove down the street to offer assistance, but the father told her to chase the white car.\nPagan tried, but said she lost sight of the vehicle.\n\"It's terrible to see something like that,\" Pagan said. \"She's just an innocent child; she was just a baby. It's horrifying to see.\"\nTwitter: @JBfromSA"}
