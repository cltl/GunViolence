(KABC) --\nA 19-year-old father was killed and three others were injured after a suspect opened fire in Long Beach Monday night.\nAround 8:43 p.m., authorities received reports of shots fired in the 1200 block of E. 17th Street, southwest of Long Beach City College.\nWhen authorities arrived, four male victims were found shot, and one was pronounced dead at the scene. The victim was identified as 19-year-old Delhaun Jackson of Long Beach.\nThe other three were taken to local hospitals, with one in critical condition and the other two in stable condition.\nA family member at the scene said Jackson had an infant son. His aunt said he had just celebrated his son's first birthday on Saturday.\nShe hopes that someone will step forward, even anonymously, and provide police with information as to what happened to her nephew.\n\"At the end of the day all we can do is pray that someone sit here and say something. Because this doesn't make any sense - here is another child (who is) fatherless, for what? It just doesn't make sense,\" she said.\nWitnesses at the scene said as many as 20 people were at a house party drinking before the shooting occurred. It was unclear what led to the shooting, and no suspect information was released.\nAuthorities were working on getting surveillance footage from nearby businesses in the area to figure out what happened. Police also asked for the public to come forward and provide information to catch the gunman.\nThe investigation was ongoing."}
