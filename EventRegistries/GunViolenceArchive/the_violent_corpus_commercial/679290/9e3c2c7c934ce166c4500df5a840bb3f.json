In a written statement, police said the investigation was ongoing. Authorities declined to comment further about the shooting.\nThe incident occurred shortly after 3 p.m. as students were leaving the June Jordan School for Equity, a high school at Brazil Street and La Grande Avenue.\nThree boys were wounded and a girl was critically injured. She was said to be improving although her condition was not immediately clear Thursday.\nPolice said after the shooting that the incident occurred in the school's parking lot and that the initial call came in at 3:20 p.m. from a school resource officer who said they needed an ambulance. A secondary call came in shortly after that.\nThe school was placed on lock out so students could not leave the building and outsiders were prohibited from entering the campus.\nPolice treated the incident, which happened around the school's dismissal time, as an active shooter situation but quickly decided that it was not.\nKTVU reporter Tara Moriarty contributed to this report."}
