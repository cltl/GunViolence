Police confirmed two male students were hospitalized along with the female student, and a fourth victim walked into San Francisco General Hospital with injuries.\n\u201cThis was not just a random shooting,\u201d said San Francisco police spokesperson Carlos Manfredi. \u201cWe believe one of the victims may have been the initial target.\u201d\nA statement on the school\u2019s website reiterated that the shooting did not appear to be random.\n\u201cWe want to reassure you that this was an isolated incident outside of the school building where one student was being targeted by outsiders,\u201d the statement reads.\nSoon after the shooting, four men believed to be the suspects ran away west along Brazil Street. They remained at large as of Tuesday night.\nStudents and staff in the school were told to lock class room doors and shelter in place until police had cleared every room in the school.\n\u201cActive shooter scenes happen very quickly,\u201d said Manfredi.\nSince three of the victims entered the school after the shooting, officials initially thought the incident occurred inside the school and that a shooter may have remained inside.\nHours after the shooting the neighborhood remained full of police who had set up a perimeter. Students and staff coming from the school after the incident said they saw people run and followed or were told to shelter in place and were then released.\nSan Francisco Unified School District spokesperson Heidi Anderson said the school will be open Wednesday but with increased security.\nThree of the victims, two males and a critically injured female, were taken to a hospital for treatment soon after the incident. The district later confirmed that a fourth student was\nalso injured.\nShamann Walton, vice president of the Board of Education, said he knows several students at the school but the names of the students injured have not been released.\n\u201cAnytime of course an incident happens like this the whole school community is concerned,\u201d Walton said. \u201cRight now, my main concern is everyone being safe and anyone who was injured being taken care of.\u201d\nWalton said the school district will respond by making sure there are support services like counselors available for students and faculty to talk with.\nActive-shooter training is also important in terms of the school district\u2019s response to incidents like this, but violence-prevention teams and law enforcement relationships with the community are also important, he said.\nStevon Cook, a candidate for the Board of Education who knows a teacher at June Jordan, said the incident is \u201calarming.\u201d\nCook called the teacher after the incident, who told him he was safe.\n\u201cHe said everything is fine,\u201d Cook said."}
