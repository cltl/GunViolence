You wouldn\u2019t have to ask for approval, you wouldn\u2019t have to ask for permission,\u201d Williams said.\nDetectives were still on the scene Sunday morning looking for clues\nThe victims are all in their early 20s and are expected to survive.\nPolice have not named any suspects in the shooting and no arrests have been made.\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories"}
