A single bullet went through a wall and struck the teen's 11-year-old brother.\nThe child was treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and released later Monday night. Lasonczyk said the child's grandfather found the round in the boy's waistband, so it appeared to have grazed him.\n\"He's moving around a little bit, a little scared as anyone would be at 11 years old not knowing what actually happened,\" the boys' uncle, Ron Smith, said.\nHis older brother, 17, told police he pulled out the magazine but that the gun still went off, Lasonczyk said.\n\"They shouldn't be playing with guns,\" Smith said. \"I don't know how this happened. Everyone that I talked to said they heard a loud 'boom.'\"\nThe teen is expected to face charges of having weapons under disability, discharge around or into a habitation, domestic violence and tampering because he hid the gun, Lasonczyk said.\nOpen full screen to view moreSign inChild grazed in shooting17,004 viewsMade with Google My MapsChild grazed in shooting\nMap data \u00a92017 Google\nTerms\n1,000 ftCreate new mapOpen mapShared with youHelpFeedbackGoogle Drive"}
