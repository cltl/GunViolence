I was getting ready to leave and I got shot in the back.\u201d\nThe barrage of gunfire \u2014 police estimate between 50 and 60 shots fired \u2014 left a trail of bullets and blood stains throughout the apartment building at NW 12th Avenue and 65th Street around 2 a.m.\nPolice have not said what may have prompted the shooting, saying it was too soon to speculate.\n\u201cWe are not too sure at this point what it was, whether it was a drive-by or someone walked up or someone was on an actual bike,\u201d said Miami police spokeswoman Frederica Burden.\nThe injured victims were rushed to Jackson Memorial, among them a 17-year-old girl named Jessica who was in critical condition with life-threatening gunshot wounds. The girl\u2019s sister told NBC 6 the teen was shot four or five times.\nOne of the teen\u2019s friends, Sharon Saint Fluer, said late Tuesday that the teen is \u201cdoing good\u201d and that, \u201cshe realizes just how easily she could have lost her life.\u201d\nMcNeal was taken to the hospital in serious condition. Earlier in the day, his uncle said McNeal was shot four times. McNeal said enough is enough with the shootings.\n\u201cSome changes need to be made,\u201d McNeal said Tuesday night. \u201cSomething needs to be done.\u201d\nIt was a message that Saint Fluer also shared with McNeal.\n\u201cIt seems as if this is just like a revolving door,\u201d Saint Fluer said. \u201cNot until it actually hits home and its somebody personal; it\u2019s just like we getting used to it. You watch the news every day, it\u2019s like okay, here we go again.\u201d\nAlso in the hospital were Kenneth Mintz, whose condition is unknown, and another man whose family refused to identify him.\nAccording to the Miami Herald, the shooters were two men carrying an AK-47 and an MR-15. Both stepped out of a dark SUV and began firing, the Herald reported.\n\"If someone's seen anything, I wish you guys [would] come forward. He was somebody's son, he was somebody's father,\" said Bennae Robinson, Richardson's aunt.\nAnyone with information is asked to call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS."}
