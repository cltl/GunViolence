That family's 2-year-old was alone in a bedroom when he reached up, grabbed a loaded handgun off a dresser, and pulled the trigger, shooting himself.\nOfficials say the family is cooperating with police, and the child is being treated at VCU Medical in Richmond.\nThe incident happened in a rural part of Virginia, where many people have guns -- in some cases a lot of them -- but the key is safely locking them up.\n\"Everybody who has a gun needs a gun safe,\" said Mike Snow, who lives right down the street from where this tragic situation took place.\nSnow has several guns and several grandchildren. When they come over, he takes extra precautions.\n\"We all have rifles, handguns... and we have handguns in our house. I have handguns throughout my place, but [if] a child's coming over, I know where they're at, they're out, they're locked up, they're unloaded,\" said Snow.\nOfficials haven't decided if charges will be filed.\nCopyright 2015 WWBT NBC12.
