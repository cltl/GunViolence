(KOIN) \u2014 Though he stands accused of 3 counts of 1st-degree murder, Brent Luyster flashed a smile at TV cameras as he made his first court appearance Monday.\nLuyster, 35, also faces one count of 1st-degree attempted murder and a 1st-degree charge of unlawful possession of a firearm. He was arrested Saturday afternoon without incident by Cowlitz County deputies and Washington State Troopers for allegedly shooting those 4 people at a home at 4006 NW 47th Street before fleeing.\nAll shot in the head\nCourt documents paint a harrowing picture of Friday\u2019s triple murder. The bodies of 3 victims were found at a Woodland home, and all 3 appeared to have been shot in the head.\nVictims\nJoseph Lamar\nJanell Knight\nZach Thompson\nBreanne Leigh (wounded)\nThe victims were identified as Joseph Lamar, Janell Knight and Zach Thompson.

Fed.\u201d\nIn court Monday, Clark County Deputy Prosecutor James Smith recommended Luyster be held without bail. That request was quickly granted.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important obviously, given the information we have at this point, given the severity of the charges that were filed, to make sure the community\u2019s protected and that there\u2019s no risk of further violence here,\u201d Smith said.\nLuyster\u2019s next scheduled court appearance is August 1.\nPrevious arrests\nLuyster, 35, was still facing charges for allegedly pistol whipping his ex-girlfriend \u2014 the mother of his child \u2014 in May. When he was arrested that time, deputies heard shots fired and eventually talked him into surrendering. He was out on bail on this particular charge at the time of the murders.\nIn 2013, Luyster, his brother Robert and a man named Donald McElfish were arrested for an alleged racial attack at the QuarterDeck Bar in Vancouver.
