Wainwright, 32, of the 9200 block of East 6th Avenue, and Da\u2019Vaughn Pitts, 18, of the 300 block of North Lake Street.\nWainwright died from a single gunshot and Pitts died from multiple gunshot wounds, the coroner\u2019s office reported.\nWainwright was pronounced dead at 5 at the scene. Pitts was pronounced dead at 5:30 p.m. at the Methodist Hospitals Northlake Campus in Gary.\nFour others were shot in the incident, including a Portage woman and a Gary woman. The other two gunshot victims are Gary men.\nOne of the wounded men is in critical condition, Ingram said.\nTwo women in their 20s were also shot, but their conditions are not considered life-threatening, the chief said.\nhttp://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/gary/gary-shootout-leaves-dead-several-wounded/article_c98c26ea-56f8-56bb-813d-5d5628587070.html\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-2-dead-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting-20130907-story.html\nhttp://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-07/news/chi-2-dead-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting-20130907_1_gary-shooting-early-morning-shooting-northlake-campus\nhttp://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/09/08/Two-dead-four-wounded-in-Gary-Ind-shooting/93281378615026/\nhttps://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1nVF0eJu7MTmYnP2BQwtXswlOKO31996FFtdmKc4#rows:id=1\nhttp://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/gary/article_c98c26ea-56f8-56bb-813d-5d5628587070.html#.Ui32_mPwe1E.twitter\nhttp://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/09/07/2-killed-4-wounded-in-gary-shooting/"}
