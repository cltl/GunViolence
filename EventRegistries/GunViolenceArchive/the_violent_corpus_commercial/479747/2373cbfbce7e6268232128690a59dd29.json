She was indicted on four counts of felony murder and two counts of attempted aggravated robbery.\nThe two robbery counts stem from Bennett and Moser attempting to rob Jacobson and Davis during a marijuana exchange, according to authorities.\nMoser was arrested at her home in Dayton. Both were set to have court appearances Friday morning in Cumberland County.\n\"I think the citizens of Cumberland County and Crossville can rest assured that we believe that we have this person that committed these crimes in custody, that this community is safe through the hard work of all these agencies,\" said TBI Director Mark Gwyn in a press conference on Sept. 13.\nAuthorities believe the four people found shot to death were deliberately targeted and not the victims of random violence, but a motive in the shooting has not been released.\nTheir bodies were discovered by a resident of the Renegade Mountain resort community, about 50 miles west of Knoxville, who saw the parked car on his way to work at about 7 a.m. Thursday.\nThe Renegade Mountain Resort was built in 1969 as part of the Cumberland Gardens gated community, and at one time had a lounge, restaurant, lodge and ski slope. The lodge was destroyed in by a fire in 2000.\n\"Our condolences go out to the families of these victims of this terrible crime. I think we also have to remember the families and school mates of these young children, so we need to keep and remember these people in our prayers and our thoughts,\" said District Attorney General Randy York at a press conference on Sept. 13.\nThe investigation is ongoing, and officials have not released information on the charges Bennett may face.\nCopyright 2013 WSMV (Meredith Corporation).
