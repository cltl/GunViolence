He was transported to Boscobel Area Hospital and Clinic by the Boscobel Rescue Squad and later taken by Medflight helicopter to Madison. He died the following day at American Family Insurance Children\u2019s Hospital in Madison.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone will ever know exactly what happened; he was alone at the time,\u201d said Crawford County Sheriff Dale McCullick. \u201cWas it self-inflicted? Was he cleaning his gun? Was he going to shoot a skunk? I\u2019ve heard all those things, but none of us will ever know what happened. It\u2019s an absolute tragedy. We all know that.\u201d\nMcCullick added that there was \u201cabsolutely no foul play\u201d and the investigation is completed.\nTuesday night\u2019s boys\u2019 basketball game was dedicated to Briar, with his framed jersey presented to Briar\u2019s parents, Scott and Kari Brown, by his sixth grade teammates. His funeral will be held Friday at 6 p.m. in the Boscobel High School gym.\nBriar was an avid athlete, a member of the sixth grade basketball team who was well liked at school.\n\u201cHe was kind of a quiet guy who always had a smile on his face,\u201d said Walters. \u201cJust a wonderful young man. He will be missed.\u201d"}
