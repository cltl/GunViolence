Green\u2019s stepchildren, a 17-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man, were found bound and shot in the home\u2019s basement. Their 39-year-old mother \u2014 and his current wife \u2014 Faith Green was discovered severely injured.\nWednesday\u2019s 911 call echoes one made by Green in 1991 after he fatally stabbed his then-wife, Tonya Green, who was six months pregnant at the time, also killing their unborn child.\n\u201cHe stabbed his wife and then he called police,\u201d Corrections spokesman Chris Gautz said of the 1991 case. \u201cWhen the police arrived, he let them in and told them what he had done.\u201d\nGreen pleaded no contest to second-degree murder and was sent to prison in 1992 with a 15-25 year sentence, Gautz said. He was paroled in 2008.\nWhile in prison, Green completed cognitive programming and had one \u201cticket\u201d for fighting over the use of a television, Gautz said. In denying Green\u2019s previous four requests for parole, the board noted he \u201cdemonstrated little emotion or remorse ... (and had) a lack of empathy,\u201d Gautz said.\nTonya Green had two other children, 5 and 8 years old, Gautz said. It is not clear if they were at home at the time of the 1991 killings or if they were harmed. There were no charges filed related to those children.\nAbout two years after Gregory Green was released from prison, he married Faith Green on Dec. 18, 2010. Public records show the couple were involved in a divorce, which was filed by Faith Green on Oct. 11, 2013, and again on Aug. 11, 2016. Records further show Gregory Green was the subject of a rejected personal protection order filed by Faith Green in February 2013.\nVictims identified\nThe Wayne County Medical Examiner identified the young children killed Wednesday as Koi Green, 5, and Kaliegh Green, 4, and ruled their deaths as homicide. The cause of death is pending for both children. The 17-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man were not formally identified Wednesday.\nThe suspect\u2019s wife, Faith Green, is mother to all four victims, police said. The older two were from a previous relationship.\nFaith Green was slashed in the face and shot in the foot, police said. She was found in the basement alongside her older children and was taken to Oakwood Hospital, where she was listed in fair condition Wednesday, according to a hospital spokesperson.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office received a warrant request from police, and officials were reviewing it for a charging decision, according to spokeswoman Maria Miller.\nFriends and classmates of the older children, meanwhile, flooded Twitter and other social media sites with pictures of the siblings, expressing shock and grief over their deaths.\nThe Southfield Times student newspaper identified the older victims as Kara Allen and Chadney J. Allen.\nKara Allen, a Southfield high school student, was a member of the student newspaper and a varsity football cheerleader as well as a member of the National Honor Society, the newspaper reported Wednesday. She dreamed of becoming a medical doctor.\nChadney J. Allen graduated from Southfield High School last year.\nProtection order denied\nIn her 2013 divorce filing, Faith Green cited a \u201cbreakdown of the marital relationship\u201d as the cause for seeking a divorce.\nBefore filing for divorce, Green applied on Feb. 22, 2013, for \u2014 but was denied \u2014 a personal protection order against her husband, according to court records. In the request, Green wrote that her husband was threatening that \u201cthings are going to get ugly\u201d if she didn\u2019t leave the home.\n\u201c(He) jumped at me like he was going to attack,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis went on for hours.\u201d\nThe complaint also claimed Gregory Green was belligerent and \u201ckicking things\u201d the day before the filing.\n\u201cHe kicked the couch while the baby was sleeping on it,\u201d she wrote.\nIn the protection request, Faith Green indicated she did not contact police but had intended to go to the station to file a formal report that day after work.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave my house and not be able to get back in,\u201d she explained.\nThe court denied the request without a hearing based on \u201cinsufficient allegations for a PPO at this time.\u201d\nBirthday decorations up\nPolice arrested the suspect outside the home without incident Wednesday, Lt. Michael Krause said, and then found the victims inside.\nPolice believe the younger children were asphyxiated in a car, then taken back inside the home and placed in their beds.\nMichigan State Police evidence technicians processed evidence at the scene, where birthday decorations hung inside a covered driveway.\n\u201cThey just had a birthday party for the little 4-year-old girl,\u201d neighbor Ronnie Jones said. \u201cAnd they had two or three picnics with their whole family this summer.\u201d\nJones, 59, who has lived in his home across the street his entire life, said the family moved in a couple of years ago and mostly kept to themselves.\n\u201cI just saw the oldest boy out cutting the grass yesterday,\u201d he said.\nMayor Dan Paletko called the homicides \u201cdevastating for the community\u201d he\u2019s been affiliated with for more than 40 years. Paletko said he\u2019s never seen a tragedy of this nature in his time in the bedroom community.\nHe called the home \u201cvery well-kept\u201d and said it had no ordinance violations. Its occupants had no known conflicts with neighbors, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to understand the motivation,\u201d Paletko said.\nDearborn Heights has had \u201cseven or eight\u201d homicides for the year, Capt. Michael Petri said.\nThe headquarters of Dearborn Heights School District 7 sits at the end of Hipp, on Annapolis. Three of the four victims attended district schools in recent years, assistant superintendent Dan Scott said.\nScott, 65, formerly the principal of down-the-road Annapolis High School, fought back tears as he discussed a tragedy he called unprecedented in his more than two decades in the district.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to imagine how something like this could happen to children in this district, or children anywhere,\u201d Scott said in his office. \u201cThis is very sad for all of us.\u201d\nAfter receiving notification from the police department about what happened, the district reviewed its enrollment records and found that the 19-year-old had attended the high school in 2013, the 17-year-old had attended it for a trimester last year, and the 6-year-old was in the district last year as well.\nSome students in District 7 were the victims\u2019 friends and acquaintances, Scott said.\nThe district is raising money to cover funeral expenses, Scott said. Donations will be accepted through Sept. 30, and anyone interested in donating can call (313) 203-1000 or stop by district offices.\njdickson@detroitnews.com\nStaff Writers Oralandar Brand-Williams and Nicquel Terry contributed."}
