They recognized Henry from wanted posters out of St. Bernard Parish, police said.\nPolice said Henry is wanted on four counts of attempted murder out of St. Bernard Parish. The St. Bernard Parish Sheriff's Office said Henry opened fire on a 17-year-old man Dec. 16 in the 2800 block of Daniel Drive in Violet.\nHenry and the teenager became involved in an argument that included several women, authorities said. The teen got out of a car that contained three women, and confronted Henry, who then opened fire. The teen suffered a graze wound to his right leg, authorities said, and was treated and released from the hospital. No other injuries were reported.\nSt. Bernard detectives developed information suggesting Henry was in New Orleans East. Detectives along with New Orleans police officers searched a home in New Orleans East last week. Henry was not there, but authorities did recover the .22-caliber handgun believed used in the shooting.\nHenry was transferred to St. Bernard Parish jail.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story, based on NOPD information, incorrectly said Henry was wanted in connection with a homicide in St. Bernard Parish. He's wanted on attempted homicide.\nEmployees at a North Broad Street store shot and attacked a man who returned to the store he unsuccessfully tried to rob, New Orleans police said."}
