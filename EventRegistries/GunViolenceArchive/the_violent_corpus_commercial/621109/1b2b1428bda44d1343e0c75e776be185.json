Gutierrez on Markison Avenue, according to family members.\nGutierrez\u2019s brother, Andre Mehler, said his brother had dated Newman for seven months and the shooting was an accident.\n\"They loved each other. He would not do this on purpose,\u201d Mehler said.\nHe said he was with them in an upstairs bedroom when the gun went off.\n\u201cI told him to put it away and stop playing with it. I get up to go\u2026and I turned around and right before I turned around I hear a boom,\u201d he said.\nThat boom was a single gunshot that struck Newman.\nMehler said Gutierrez was putting in the clip in and out of the gun when it fired.\n\u201c[The gun] has a hair trigger on it. So if you touch it lightly, it's going to go off,\u201d Mehler said.\nThe frantic call to dispatchers came from Gutierrez.\nDispatcher: Did you see who shot her?\nCaller: Yeah, it was me. We were playing with the gun. We were playing with a gun, ma'am. Babe, wake up.\nDispatcher: Where is she shot?\nCaller: In the arm or in the chest, I don't know. Please help me, please.\nPolice have charged Gutierrez with murder.\nMeanwhile, Mehler said he wants people to know his brother is not a killer.\n\u201cI know it was accidental, I was right there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not on purpose.\"\nGutierrez\u2019s father said his son has no criminal record and was two credits away from graduating from South High School.\nOn Thursday, a judge set his bond at $1 million.\nNewman attended Upper Arlington High School until her junior year. The school said grievance counselors will be at the school Thursday and Friday."}
