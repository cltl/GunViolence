As if the residents haven't been through enough already because of slumlords stealing taxpayer money and failing to provide safe, livable conditions, now this terrible act of violence occurs. My heart goes out to the families dealing with this tragedy, and our prayers are with the wounded. It\u2019s important that we get all the facts about what happened, whether an appropriate amount of security is being provided, and what steps need to be taken to make this community more safe. There must be accountability and the perpetrators of this attack must be held responsible.\nThis is a developing story. Stay with First Coast News for updates and read the full letter to HUD below:"}
