I\u2019ve had doctors have to give him drugs so he can sleep at night,\u201d defense attorney Richard McCague said of his client\u2019s emotional status.\nJohn Burnsworth, 14, entered a plea Friday in the shooting death of 13-year-old James Robert Gustafson of Mount Pleasant.\n\u201cThis is a catastrophe that was absolutely avoidable,\u201d McCague said.\nInitially charged with felony homicide, Burnsworth pleaded guilty Friday to misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter and a misdemeanor firearms charge.\nOn the stand, Burnsworth answered \u201cyes\u201d to the judge\u2019s questions, including \u2014 did he understand he was admitting to shooting Gustafson back in March of 2016.\n\u201cAt least Burnsworth gets the help he needs so he can be a good person. I really want justice for my son and people need to lock the guns up \u2019cause there\u2019s more and more going on,\u201d said Leah Smith Gustafson, the victim\u2019s mother.\nShe was overcome with emotion during and after the hearing.\nBurnsworth\u2019s disposition hearing is coming up. He could be released, or he could remain in juvenile supervision.\nThe judge said she\u2019d like to see some mental health evaluations before she makes any determinations regarding the young man\u2019s fate."}
