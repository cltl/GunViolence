On Tuesday, they confirmed the baby's shooting death was most likely part of an on-going gang war, possibly in retaliation for the murder of John Williams in downtown Seattle March 19th.\nWilliams was a member of the street gang known as Low Profile. Malijah's father, Matrise Grant, has been identified as a member of rival gang, Deuce 8, although he has denied such ties. Matrise Grant was behind the wheel of the vehicle when his daughter was struck and killed while seated in her car seat.\nAccording to investigators, the two gangs have been targeting each other for months, and are responsible for up to 15 shootings from Seattle to Tacoma this year.\nThe investigation into Malijha's death has led to other crimes being solved.\n\u201cAs a result of this investigation specifically, we have recovered five firearms that have been involved in five different shootings in south King County,\u201d Detective Melanie Robinson told KIRO 7.\nHowever, Robinson said it\u2019s been very difficult to bring charges in Malijha\u2019s murder case because of the street code against \u201csnitching.\u201d\n\u201cI think there\u2019s information out there that people are withholding that would help us,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWhat kind of people can withhold such information and not help?\u201d\nEven though a suspect has been identified, investigators believe more people are involved in Malijha\u2019s death and they\u2019re asking that street code be put aside for a baby's justice.\n\u201cMalijha was a person.\u201d Robinson told KIRO 7 on Tuesday. \u201cShe mattered. And she didn\u2019t have a chance because of a senseless gang shooting.\u201d\nTo pass along information anonymously, call 253-852-2121.\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
