A farmworker was accidentally shot in the leg in an orchard near Road 208.\nA farmworker picking blueberries near Road 148 and Avenue 208 was shot in the leg Friday morning by a teenager practicing his shooting about a half a mile away.\nNumerous Tulare County Sheriff deputies and California Highway Patrol officers responded to the area after receiving 9-1-1 calls from several farmworkers that they were being fired upon.\nLess than a mile away, Rockford Elementary School was placed on lockdown for approximately 45 minutes, said Superintendent Caron Borba.\nThe students were out playing at recess when the shooting began, Borba said, but no one was injured and all students were accounted for.\n\u201cUltimately, it was a big, fat accident,\u201d said Sheriff\u2019s Department Sgt. Nathan Polk, who was at the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more drama than anything else.\u201d\n\u201cIt was all accidental. A 16-year-old youth was target shooting with a .22 rifle. Some [bullets] flew over and hit a field worker in the leg. It\u2019s non-life threatening,\u201d Polk said.\nThe workers, however, had no idea what was happening and hit the ground as bullets continued to fire.\nAccording to Polk, the youth had no idea anything had happened until he saw numerous emergency vehicles approaching his home.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going with negligent discharge of a firearm,\u201d Polk said. \u201cHe had no intent on hitting anyone.\u201d\nBut because a person was hit, and transferred to the hospital, Polk said, the youth was taken into custody."}
