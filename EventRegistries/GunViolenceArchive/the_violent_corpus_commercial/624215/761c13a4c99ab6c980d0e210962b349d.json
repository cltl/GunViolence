And he was on his way,\" David Parsons said.\nMichael was cleaning his Remington hunting rifle at his home around 3 p.m. Saturday when it fired, said Boiling Springs Police Chief Nathan Phillips.

David Parsons questioned how this could have happened to his best friend, his \"little boy.\"\nHe was the youngest of four children and had captured his parent's hearts as soon as he was born.\n\"Truly, God blessed us with him,\" Myrtle Parsons said.\nBefore he was born, Myrtle Parsons dedicated the Lynyrd Skynyrd song, \"Simple Man,\" to him \u2014 knowing he was going to be the kind of person who enjoyed the simple things in life.\nMicheal spent the first three years of his life abroad in Italy, where his dad was stationed. One of his favorite places to eat on base was Burger King, and he could find one anywhere he went, David Parsons said.\nMichael was a quiet child growing up and kept his quiet nature into his teenage years, surrounding himself with family, a close knit group of friends and his constant companion, his rottweiler-German shepherd dog, Mable, his father said.\n\"I don't know how I'm going to break it to her (Mable),\" David Parsons said.\nAn outdoorsman who loved video games and learned the alphabet by learning the names of dinosaurs, Michael was a teenager who knew a little bit about everything, his mother said.\n\"He was always happy,\" she said.\nA neighbor, who wished to remain unnamed, always saw Michael and his family happy together.\nMichael was expected to get his license this year and was looking forward to starting welding classes this fall. He dreamed of becoming a welder in the future and had already planned on going to Cleveland Community College after high school to get his certificate and training, David Parsons said.\nMichael's teachers from Crest High School visited the family, who is staying at the American Inn while their home is cleaned.\n\"They wouldn't even let us back into the house,\" David Parsons choked out.\n\"There is a hole in my heart. I just don't want to go on,\" Myrtle Parsons said.\nHis family was thankful their son had been saved and attended Victory Baptist Church in Lattimore.\nMichael leaves behind his mother and father; his older sisters, Rebecca, Krystal and Jessica; and a 6-year-old niece.\n\"I'm just grateful for the 17 years that we had him,\" David Parsons said."}
