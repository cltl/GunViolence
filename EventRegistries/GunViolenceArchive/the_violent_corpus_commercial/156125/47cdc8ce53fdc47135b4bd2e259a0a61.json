The second person killed was in his 30s but has yet to be named.\nPolice confirm that Tashia Burse was the woman who was grazed in the head. Her condition has stabilized. A fourth person who police identify as Ricky Hudson, 27, is in critical condition as a result of the shooting.\nIt happened at NW 61st Street and 19th Avenue at 10:23 p.m. Sunday.\nWhen police arrived they found four people had been shot. Two of them were pronounced dead on the scene. Burse and Hudson were rushed to the Ryder Trauma Center.\nArea residents said the shooting happened on a back porch behind an apartment building.\nKristal White, who lives in the apartment complex with her 7-year-old and 12-year-old daughters, told CBS4\u2019s Peter D\u2019Oench, \u201cWe just heard gunshots and the kids started running. It sounded like Boom, boom, boom. The 4th of July. It was scary.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate that this happened in this close-knit community,\u201d White said. \u201cIt is very unfortunate that we lose lives every day down here. I hope it won;t be one of my kids one day. Nobody\u2019s going to come forward and say anything. I just hope people keep their children close and pray for them.\u201d\nA woman, who did not want to be identified for fear she would become a target, says she heard dozens of shots fired and immediately took cover with her three-year-old great grandchild by her side. The one thing on her mind was the mass shooting in Liberty City that occurred almost two weeks ago where a total of nine people were shot when bullets went through windows and walls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a continuous thing and I don\u2019t like it but unfortunately I can move so we either have to accept it because it doesn\u2019t look like the authorities are able to stop them,\u201d she said.\nThe same sense of hopelessness and desperation echoed Monday morning by parents dropping their kids off at a daycare right across the street from the crime scene.\n\u201cI can only do what I am able to do, you know? Drop my kids off and pray that they remain safe,\u201d said Gabe Moore. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy in the inner city. It doesn\u2019t make any sense man. We are all young and can be doing better than what we are doing.\u201d\nCBS4 also heard that there may be a fifth victim. A woman who was driving in the area may have been caught in the gunfire and was taken to the hospital. Miami-Dade police said they heard that but have not been able to confirm it.\nSome neighbors said they feared the worst but were hoping for the best.\nMany residents voiced concerns of the recent gun violence in the area.\n\u201cIt needs to stop,\u201d said Lulu Williams, a rfelative of one of the victims. \u201cThere is just too much killing and they are young, not even 25 and mothers and daddies are hurting and they are leaving their children. It\u2019s like they just doing care about life no more and I think it needs to stop.\u201d\nThe shooting took place about a mile from where the mass shooting in Liberty City occurred almost two weeks ago, where nine people were shot. Police are looking into whether the shootings are related.\nA check of records shows that Tyquavious Charles had been arrested before for delivering and selling cannabis, the use of a firearm during a felony and resisting an officer without violence.\nRecords also show Ricky Hudson has an extensive arrest history, including charges for attempted first degree murder and throwing a missle into a vehicle or a building and property damage.\nDetectives have no description of the gunmen. Anyone with information should call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS (8477). There\u2019s a reward of up to $3,000.\nRELATED CONTENT:"}
