We\u2019ve got to stop, young men. We\u2019ve got to stop, young women,\u201d Foward said.\nHe said the violence makes it difficult for the NAACP to continue to fight for economic development in this community, for job retention and job growth.\n\u201cBut we have to keep fighting,\u201d Foward said. \u201cWe can no longer sweep under the rug the violence of black on black. It is something that is inhuman.\n\u201cIs it going to take this child\u2019s life\u2026 to curb this reign of terror inside our community?\u201d Foward asked, rhetorically. \u201cI don\u2019t have the answer but I hope that somewhere, in their hearts, that they know they are destroying our community by their senseless acts of violence.\u201d\nUPDATE @ 5:30 p.m.: Two males detained as persons of interest in Thursday\u2019s fatal shooting of a 13-month-old Dayton child are being questioned by homicide investigators. Their apprehensions occurred following a high-speed pursuit that ended in the 1700 block of Oakridge Drive, Lt. Eric Henderson said.\n\u201cWe have two persons in custody, one of which is potentially a suspect in the crime\u201d that led to the death of Elijah Johnson and the wounding of his grandmother and the boyfriend of his mother, Henderson said. \u201cAt this time we don\u2019t know if both [persons of interest] are related to the incident, so it\u2019s still under investigation.\u201d\nHenderson said one of the individuals was arrested near the vehicle both men were in, and police also recovered a firearm from near where that vehicle ended up, in a yard on Oakridge Drive. The other individual was apprehended as police and sheriff\u2019s deputies were searching yards and houses in the neighborhood.\nThe two men fled in the vehicle from a traffic stop that began about 3:43 p.m. in the area of West Third Street and Gettysburg Avenue, Henderson said. That led to a pursuit that reached speeds of up to 80 mph on the Trotwood Connector and slowed as it reached city neighborhoods, the lieutenant said.\nUPDATE @ 5:13 p.m.:\nPolice have seized a black Chevy Impala they believe was used in Thursday\u2019s fatal shooting.
