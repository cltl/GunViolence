Jonathan Perok said in a news release.\nWhen officers arrived, they located two victims, a 17-year-old Manassas boy and a 16-year-old Woodbridge boy, by a wooded area in that location, Perok said.\nOne of the victims had been shot in the upper body and the other had a minor, non-gunshot-related head injury, police said.
