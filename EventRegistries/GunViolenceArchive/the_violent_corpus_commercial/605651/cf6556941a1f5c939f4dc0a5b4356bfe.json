Mr. Thomas said that during the fight, he ran into a man with whom he had a dispute. The two exchanged words.\nAccording to a police affidavit, Mr. Thomas said he got a small, black handgun from someone he played basketball with and then returned to scare the man who had threatened him \u201cbecause he believed he was going to be shot ...\u201d\nMr. Thomas told police that he pointed a gun near the spot where the other man was standing in an effort to scare him. He said he fired once, according to the affidavit. However, he told detectives, \u201cthe trigger was \u2018sensitive\u2019 and when he brought the gun down \u2018it started going crazy and kept going off until [the magazine] was empty.\u2019 \u201d\nWitnesses told police they heard three to five shots. Everyone on the porch scattered, and bullets struck Isis and the house.\nMr. Thomas later told people that he realized he shot the girl, police said.\nJonathan D.
