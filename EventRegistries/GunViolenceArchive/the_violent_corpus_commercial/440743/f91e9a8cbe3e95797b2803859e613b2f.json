He declined to say how many times they had been shot, or where they were shot.\nThe victims' cause of death is gunshot wound and the manner of death has been ruled a homicide.\nAlthough the coroner's office said there were few defensive wounds on their bodies, the agency is limiting details due to the ongoing investigation.\nShore thinks the victims were killed sometime between noon and 3 p.m. Sunday.\nMichael Scott had texted his boss on Sunday that he would be at work on Monday. A family member came to the house at 3:30 p.m. Sunday, but no one appeared to be home.\nVilardy said that the family usually had a big meal on Sunday around noon. And Shore said the autopsies showed that Michael and Cathy had both had a large meal about an hour before their deaths.\nThere was no forced entry into the home.\nShore said that the magnitude of the injuries is terrible.\nAnyone with information regarding this case is asked to contact the Anderson County Sheriff's Office at 864-260-4400 or Crimestoppers at 1-888-CRIME-SC.\nCopyright 2015 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation).
