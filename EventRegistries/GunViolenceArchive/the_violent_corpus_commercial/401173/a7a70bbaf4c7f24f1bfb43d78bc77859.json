The juvenile was transported to Upson Regional Medical Center and later air lifted to Macon Medical Center in critical condition. On Saturday August 22, 2015, the juvenile was pronounced dead by the on staff medical doctor at the Macon Medical Center with an autopsy pending with the GBI Crime Lab. The family has requested that the juvenile\u2019s name not be released.\nEvidence will show that Christopher Len Jones, 17 of Thomaston who lived at 105 Third Street in Thomaston was in possession of a stolen .45 cal Taurus handgun and was pointing it around the room and while pointing the gun at his brother the trigger was pulled, striking the victim in the head. Statements that were given by witnesses that were inside the bedroom during this incident are consistent that the brothers were playing with each other with this weapon and that this act was not intentional. On this date Christopher Len Jones was charged with Involuntary Manslaughter, Aggravated Assault, Tampering with Evidence, two counts of Entering Auto, and Possession of a Firearm during the Commission of a Crime. Atravius Lee Mizell, 17 of Thomaston was also charged with two counts of Entering Auto in connection to this case as well.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the Gwyn family as they mourn the loss of this young man. Certain cases in this community affect some but when a child\u2019s life is lost at such a young age it affects us all."}
