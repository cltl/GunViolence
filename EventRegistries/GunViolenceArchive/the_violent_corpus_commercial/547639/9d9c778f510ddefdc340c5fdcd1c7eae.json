Stop them!\u201d and pointed police in the direction of the two men.\nThose two men, identified as 17-year-olds, were then taken into custody for questioning. A semi-automatic pistol was recovered from the bushes.\nIt has not been determined if that was the gun used in the shooting or how those teens came to possess it.\nThe teens are being questioned; no charges have been filed at this time.\nTwo officers, along with at least two former officers working in a security capacity, were at Music City Central at the time of the shooting but not near the incident.\nPolice spokesman Aaron said in a press conference the shooting \u201cdoes not appear at all to be a random, happenstance event.\u201d He said surveillance shows the teenagers riding the escalators up and down, up and down, \u201cas if they were looking for someone\u201d and \u201clooking to do harm\u201d against someone else.\nAaron noted there are multiple camera angles inside the MTA bus terminal and surveillance is \u201creally good.\u201d The footage will be investigated as they follow a number of leads.\n\u201cWe are trying to develop a complete picture of what happened and why,\u201d he told the media.\nThere will also be a strong police presence Tuesday during the early morning and late afternoon rush hours as students transfer to other buses to get to and from school. It is estimated that more than 4,000 young people pass through Music City Central to transfer buses each day.\nMORE: Security heightened at downtown bus station after 4 teens shot\nDetectives, aided by surveillance video, are pursuing a number of leads as they work to identify the shooter.

As that bus entered the Music City Central station, the passengers heard gunfire. The driver didn\u2019t stop and left the scene.\nRoth talked to News 2 after the incident.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful.
