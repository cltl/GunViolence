He was shot in the torso, Ms. Toler said.\nMr. Richardson was driving a silver Volvo sedan with two other men inside when it was struck by several bullets, Ms. Toler said. The vehicle's front passenger-side window had been shot out, she said.\nAbout the same time, officers found a man outside in the 200 block of Burrows Street with injuries to his lower back that Ms. Toler said were possibly caused by fragments from a separate shooting. Zone 2 police are investigating that incident.\nTwo of the wounded men were taken to UPMC Mercy, and the other was taken to UPMC Presbyterian. Ms. Toler did not know their conditions. Police have not said what led up to the shootings.\nLarge crowds gathered as police were collecting evidence and inspecting the Volvo. At one point, Aaron Myrick, 21, of Carrick tried to cross the crime scene tape and ignored officers' commands to stay back, Ms. Toler said. One officer was knocked to the ground and another used a Taser on Mr. Myrick, who was arrested and taken to the Allegheny County Jail.\nFirst Published April 5, 2015 6:49 PM"}
