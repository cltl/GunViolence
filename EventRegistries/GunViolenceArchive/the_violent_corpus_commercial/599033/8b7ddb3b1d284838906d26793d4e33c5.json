Brown, a documented gang member, was booked in the Central Detention Center in San Bernardino on suspicion of murder and is being held in lieu of $1.5 million bail.\nBrown, who\u2019s on Post Release Community Supervision, is also being held on a no-bail warrant for violating the terms of release. Under PRCS, triple non \u2014 non-violent, non-serious, non-sexual \u2014 offenders who would\u2019ve been placed on parole are instead monitored by local county probation agencies as part of the California Prison Realignment Plan or Assembly Bill 109.\nBrown was convicted in June 2013 for an attempt to evade a peace officer with reckless driving, San Bernardino County Probation spokeswoman Kimberly Epps said.\n\u201cOn July 14, 2016 he reported to the Fontana probation office,\u201d she said in an emailed statement Friday. \u201cProbation officers recognized him and detained him on a warrant. Probation contacted the San Bernardino Police Department who responded to probation and assumed custody of him.\u201d\nEpps said records show that Brown was in compliance with his probation and reporting according to his terms of release prior to the shooting.\nOn July 8, police were dispatched about 9:20 p.m. after a report of gunfire at Superior Liquor, 2950 Del Rosa Ave.\nThree victims \u2014 Samathy Mahan, 25, Travon \u201cHefty\u201d Lamar Williams, 26, and Travon Williams, 9 \u2014 exited the liquor store when a man who had been loitering in the parking lot confronted them, Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said.\n\u201cThey were all shot as they came out of the store,\u201d he explained. \u201cMahan ran around the corner and Brown followed him and shot him again multiple times.\u201d\nBurguan voiced his dissatisfaction in the laws AB109 and Prop 47 and how they adversely affect the community.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding it\u2019s a reoccurring thing that we\u2019re making contact with these people who are freed on probation,\u201d he said. \u201cTime and time again, we make arrests of someone on PRCS and now a 9-year-old boy is dead.\u201d\nBurguan also said the community was key in solving this crime and thanked them for coming forward.\n\u201cMany times, we investigate crimes and the community refuses to come forward, this wasn\u2019t one of those times,\u201d Burguan said. \u201cPeople are outraged over this, and this just goes to show that when the community gets involved and calls us with information, we can make an arrest and hold the person accountable for their crimes.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nPolice said an ongoing violent history between Brown and Mahan sparked the triple homicide.\nDetectives said in a written statement that a shooting on June 15th happened at 2871 N. Park Avenue, directly around the corner from Friday\u2019s homicide scene. They say Brown and Mahan fought and according to a witness Brown had been shot during the altercation between the two.\nAfter the triple homicide happened, detectives began receiving dozens of calls from both anonymous and named callers who identified Brown as the shooter.\nAfter Brown\u2019s arrest, he was taken to police headquarters to be questioned by detectives. He\u2019s expected to appear in San Bernardino County Superior Court Monday morning."}
