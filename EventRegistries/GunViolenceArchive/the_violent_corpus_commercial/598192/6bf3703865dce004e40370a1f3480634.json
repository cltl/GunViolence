He was hit several times in his protective vest, and one time below the vest, but managed to wound the gunman.\n\"The officer called out on the radio screaming for assistance,\" Valdosta Police Chief Brian Childress said, and officers from multiple law enforcement agencies arrived at the scene.\nThe officer underwent surgery after being struck in the abdomen, and is in serious condition.\n\"His family is at the hospital. And I'm happy to report he's going to be fine,\" said Childress. \"He's in stable condition but he's in the ICU as a precaution.\"\nChildress said they don't know the gunman's motive, and there does not appear to be a connection to Thursday night's shootings in Dallas, which left five officers dead.\n\"You start to wonder. But any motive of why this happened this morning would be speculation,\" he said.\nWith News Wire Services"}
