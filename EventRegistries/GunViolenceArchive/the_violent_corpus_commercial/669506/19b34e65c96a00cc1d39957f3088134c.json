Bettancourt's cousin called 911 from a neighbor's house, according to the report.\nThe teenager was flown to Lee Memorial Hospital for treatment.\nDeputies searched the scene of the shooting for evidence but could not find anything, the report stated. Police also could not find any witnesses, and there was no video surveillance footage.\nBettancourt could not tell police why he had waited 45 minutes to report the shooting, according to the police report.\nWhen deputies interviewed Frankie Rodriguez, another cousin of Bettancourt's, on Wednesday, Rodriguez told police that he, Bettancourt and \"another adult male\" were at the residence at the 300 block of South Seventh Street on Tuesday, according to a different police report.\nRodriguez told police that the \"other adult male\" had brought two illegal firearms to the residence and that Bettancourt had been playing with one of the guns when it accidentally went off and injured the teenager, the report stated.\nRodriguez and the unidentified man fled the scene before police arrived because \"they did not want to get into trouble,\" according to the report.\nDeputies arrested Rodriguez on Wednesday and charged him with violation of state probation.\nBecause the investigation is ongoing, police could not identify the other suspect, Collier County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kristi Lester said in an email.\nNo charges have been filed against Bettancourt, she said."}
