Meyer Jr. was charged Thursday with criminal homicide, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and endangering the welfare of a child.\nThe charges stem from the Jan. 11 death of his 12-year-old daughter Ciara, who was killed after being shot during a confrontation between Meyer and a state constable.\nPerry County District Attorney Andrew J. Bender announced the charges at a news conference in New Bloomfield.\nMeyer also was charged with persons not to possess, use, manufacture, control, sell or transfer firearms after the investigation revealed he was not permitted to possess a firearm \u201cdue to a prior involuntary commitment under the Mental Health Procedures Act,\u201d according to the Perry County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\u201cBut for Donald Meyer Jr.\u2019s extremely reckless actions in pointing a loaded semi-automatic rifle at a uniformed law enforcement officer, Ciara Meyer would not have been killed,\u201d Bender said.\nOn Jan. 11, state Constable Clarke Steele went to Meyer\u2019s apartment to serve an eviction notice.\nAccording to a criminal complaint, Meyer, 57, initially opened the door to his apartment and then closed it. When he opened the door again, the two men exchanged words.\nMeyer then pointed a semi-automatic rifle at Steele\u2019s chest, and Steele drew his service pistol and fired a shot that struck Meyer in his arm, the complaint states.\nThe bullet traveled through Meyer\u2019s arm and struck his daughter Ciara, who was standing behind him, according to the district attorney\u2019s office. She died at the scene.\nThe district attorney\u2019s office cleared Steele of any wrongdoing, saying he discharged his weapon lawfully in self-defense.\n\u201cCiara Meyer\u2019s death is a direct result of the willful and deliberate reckless behavior of (Donald Meyer),\u201d the district attorney\u2019s office said. \u201cIn pointing a loaded rifle at a uniformed law enforcement officer, knowing that his daughter was in close proximity, (he) consciously disregarded an unjustifiable and extremely high risk that his actions could cause the death of, or serious bodily injury to (his daughter).\u201d"}
