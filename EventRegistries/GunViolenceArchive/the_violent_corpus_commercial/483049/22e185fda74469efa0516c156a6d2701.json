She was pronounced dead at the scene.\nCiara died as a result of a single gun shot wound, according to Perry County Coroner Michael Shalonis.\nA homicide is defined as any time \u201cone human being causes the death of another,\u201d according to the Legal Information Institute at Cornell University Law School.\n\u201cNot all homicide is murder, as some killings are manslaughter, and some are lawful, such as when justified by an affirmative defense, like insanity or self-defense,\u201d the school\u2019s website explains.\nAccording to the Associated Press, Steele fired after 57-year-old Donald Meyer, the girl\u2019s father, threatened him with a loaded, .223-caliber rifle, which Meyer pointed at Steele when the constable tried to serve a district judge\u2019s eviction order.\nSteele\u2019s bullet passed through Meyer\u2019s arm, AP reported, and fatally struck the girl, who was standing behind her father.\nSteele, who has served in Perry and Dauphin counties for the past six years, is \"completely distraught over this incident \u2014 this is the worst nightmare any of us as constables can encounter,\" Bill Stoeffler, a Dauphin County constable and spokesman for the region's constables' association, told PennLive.com.\nStoeffler said it was \"absolutely not intentional\" that the girl was shot.\nState police confirmed there was an ongoing eviction process and that Meyer knew the constable was on his way to execute the order to vacate the home.\n\"It was absolutely no surprise he was coming at this date and time,\" Trooper Rob Hicks, state police spokesman, told the Associated Press.\nMeyer was flown to Hershey Medical Center for treatment. He remains in the hospital and will be charged with assault and reckless endangerment upon his release, police said.\nA GoFundMe site named \u201cCiara\u2019s Fund\u201d was created to help pay for funeral costs and to set up a scholarship fund in Ciara\u2019s memory."}
