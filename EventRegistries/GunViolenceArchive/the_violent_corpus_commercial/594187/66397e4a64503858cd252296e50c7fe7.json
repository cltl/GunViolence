Brumby, 14 \u2014 was standing behind his father, William, who was firing from the last shooting lane, with a wall on his right-hand side, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\nAfter firing a round, the spent shell casing struck the wall and deflected, falling into the back of the father's shirt.\nWilliam Brumby used his right hand \u2014 which was holding the handgun \u2014 to remove the casing.\n\"While doing so, he inadvertently pointed the firearm directly behind him and accidentally fired,\" the sheriff's office said.\nThe round struck the teen, who was rushed to Sarasota Memorial Hospital and later died.\nWilliam Brumby's 24-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter were present at the time of the shooting, authorities said.\nThe investigation into Stephen's death is ongoing, but at this time there are no charges pending against the father.\nThe gun range boasts nine indoor lanes for shooters, and was called the \"safest indoor shooting range ever designed\" by the Herald Tribune when it was built in 2013 \u2014 with strategically placed armored steel plates to take on stray rounds and prevent ricochets.\nThe range also offers free shooting for children, as long as they are accompanied by an adult."}
