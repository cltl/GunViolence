On Wednesday, he was charged with murder, robbery and related offenses.\nPrice was arrested last year for robbery and aggravated assault. The case was listed for trial three times and then withdrawn by the prosecution in September.\nNo one answered the door Wednesday night at the house on Loretto Avenue listed in public records as Price's residence.\nWilsey, a ninth-grader at Northeast High School, was shot to death when he and another teenager were ambushed on the 6200 block of Brous Avenue, police said.\nIn the days after the shooting, which shocked the teenager's friends, police said the motive for the slaying wasn't known. Wilsey's friend initially told investigators that the two had been walking to a nearby store to get a snack, but a source later said the pair may have been ambushed after two men saw them selling marijuana to another friend.\nAuthorities on Wednesday didn't immediately provide additional details about any potential motive.\nWilsey was shot once in the chest and taken to Aria Health-Torresdale Campus, where he was pronounced dead at 9:37 p.m. that night. The other teen wasn't harmed.\nFriends have described Wilsey as athletic and outgoing, and said he enjoyed playing football, basketball and video games."}
