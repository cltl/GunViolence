His 16-year-old brother, C.J. Mikula-Conrad, was critically injured but is now doing well.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start the New Year off on the right foot and bring this person to justice,\u201d McKnight said. \u201cThat\u2019s my New Year\u2019s wish.\u201d\nThere were comforting hugs and words of encouragement.\nAutumn Perkins is with the group Mothers With a Voice.\n\u201cWhen I heard this story, it broke my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cNo 11-year-old child deserves to be murdered like that, and he needs justice. Something has to be done. This killer has to be brought to justice.\u201d\nThe reward for information leading to an arrest is now up to $2,000. The family says there will be a candlelight vigil in front of the house on the first day of every month until the killer is caught.\nAllegheny County Police say there is nothing new in this case."}
