His death was ruled a homicide by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner\u2019s office.\nCJ, a student at Pittsburgh Carrick High School, where he was on the wrestling team, was in stable condition, Allegheny County police Lt. Andrew Schurman said.\nMonday was scheduled to be the first day of off-season conditioning for the wrestling team, said coach Len Orbovick, who considered canceling the session after hearing of the shooting.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid,\u201d Mr. Orbovick said of CJ, who recently started working one day a week at Maietta Restaurant on nearby Brownsville Road. \u201cHe was one of my JV wrestlers last year, as a ninth-grader. He was popular, he was one of the guys. And he worked hard.\n\u201dMy kids are pretty upset about it, and they\u2019re all very concerned for him and his family. But I decided to keep things as normal as possible and go ahead and have the workout. Most of the guys came. We talked about Chris and how we could support him and his family and maybe going to visit him. We talked about counseling services that are available through the school, and of course, I told them I\u2019m always there for them. The attitude with most of them is to move forward and try to make him proud.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s tough is that these kids have [experienced] this kind of thing before. We lost a football player at the beginning of football season to gun violence. I mean, this isn\u2019t new to these guys, and it sucks.\u201d\nThe boys\u2019 stepfather, David McKnight, declined to comment when he briefly returned to their street-level brown brick home to collect some things before leaving again.\nAcross wide Hays Avenue, and up a flight of steps, Ms. Cain, 33, answered concerned phone calls and comforted tearful neighbors on her porch, overlooking David\u2019s home.\n\u201cI know my kids won\u2019t be answering the door. We\u2019ll be locked down, and I\u2019m seriously thinking about moving, because it won\u2019t be the same coming out here and not hearing his voice,\u201d Ms. Cain said of David.\nShe was one of more than a dozen shocked neighbors and friends who aimlessly milled up and down the street, greeted each other with hugs and tears and created a memorial of balloons, a Pittsburgh Penguins teddy bear and a prayer candle on the family\u2019s front porch.\nEveryone knew David.\nNeighbors remembered him as a friendly, hyper 11-year-old with big, round cheeks who took care of his own and even was willing to help neighbors take out their trash.\n\u201cThat boy knew what love was. Not only did he know what it was, he knew how to give it back tenfold,\u201d Beth Krut, 47, of Mount Oliver said of her daughter\u2019s friend. \u201cYou only get that from one place. You get it from your parents.\u201d\nMs. Cain said David went to Bible school with her daughters and walked them to the nearby store, always sure to call and let her know they\u2019d arrived safely.\nA GoFundMe site, \u201cFuneral Fund for Little David,\u201d raised more than $5,250 for the family within hours of its creation.\n\u201cDavid was well liked by students and staff. The sixth-grader enjoyed art and reading, and he would often be found in the school\u2019s library,\u201d district officials said in a statement. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family at this time as they deal with this tragedy.\u201d\nThe district said counselors at Pittsburgh Classical Academy would support students or staff members who may need it and sent home a letter Monday to families at the school containing strategies to help children \u201cin coping with this loss.\u201d\nAt least five county detectives spent Monday morning interviewing neighbors, but no arrests have been made. Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact county homicide or Mount Oliver police.\nDan Majors contributed. Lexi Belculfine: lbelculfine@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1878.
