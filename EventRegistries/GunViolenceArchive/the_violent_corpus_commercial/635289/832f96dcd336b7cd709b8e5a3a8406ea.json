I had to duck and dive and weave again,\u201d Roche said.\nPolice swat teams closed off a number of streets in the area, searching homes and yards for the two men who ran off.\nAnyone with information on the suspects is asked to contact Crimestoppers.\nThe state trooper is expected to be okay.\nPolice haven't identified the man killed.\nCopyright 2016 WVUE.
