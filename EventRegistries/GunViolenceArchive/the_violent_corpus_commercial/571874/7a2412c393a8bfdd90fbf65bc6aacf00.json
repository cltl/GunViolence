The first officers on scene discovered Hemmings mortally wounded on the floor. A toy gun was discovered next to the boy, according to the affidavit, and officers quickly located a Glock pistol in a plastic bin in a bedroom closet.\nHemmings died a short time later.\nIn the meantime, officers questioned Taylor in the presence of the boys\u2019 mother.\nInitially, according to the affidavit, Taylor said that Hemmings had discovered the gun and shot himself. Taylor told officers that after the shooting he \u201chid the gun out of fear.\u201d\nAfter officers challenged that story, Taylor \u201cthen said that he obtained the gun from the plastic bin in the bedroom,\u201d and that their sister, who was also present, did not know the boy had it, according to the affidavit. At that point, Taylor said \u201che went into the kitchen (and) was holding the gun in front of Anthony who was some four feet away on the mattress in the living room.\u201d\nAccording to the affidavit, Taylor said he was using his sister\u2019s phone to search for videos of a Glock model 40. Taylor said he then \u201cset the gun on the table and Anthony came over and took the gun and pulled the slide one time while the barrel was pointed at Anthony\u2019s chest and Anthony pulled the trigger,\u201d according to the affidavit.\nAccording to the document, Taylor then \u201csaid he told Anthony to give the gun back but Anthony moved away from him and then pulled the trigger causing one bullet to enter his chest.\u201d\nAt that point, according to the affidavit, the boys\u2019 mother told officers to stop questioning Taylor, and he was arrested.\nThe affidavit was unsealed after 9NEWS requested a review of a court order that Taylor\u2019s photo, which had been released by the Aurora Police Department, not be published.\nIn his ruling, District Judge John Popovich made it clear that Colorado law allows the publication of photos of juveniles charged with serious felonies, as Taylor was.\nIn the same ruling, Popovich unsealed the arrest affidavit.\nContact 9NEWS reporter Kevin Vaughan with tips about this or any story: kevin.vaughan@9news.com or 303-871-1862.\nCopyright 2016 KUSA"}
