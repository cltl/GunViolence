Decatur Blvd. near Rancho Drive, Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Jeff Goodwin said.\nThe person shot was pronounced dead at University Medical Center\u2019s trauma unit about 40 minutes later, Metro homicide Lt. Dan McGrath said. The man looked to be in his late teens, but his identity had not been confirmed as of 10 p.m.\nWhen the shooting happened, a 26-year-old man who lives in the complex heard two loud bangs from his nearby bedroom.\n\u201cLike \u2018pow-pow,\u2019\u201d the man, who did not want to be named, said. \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t know if was fireworks, but it did seem louder than expected.\u201d\nWhen he stepped outside to check, he saw a man running.\nMcGrath said police are looking for two suspects: both Hispanic men wearing T-shirts and shorts. The shooter was wearing a black baseball cap with a ponytail in the back, held together with a rubber band. The other man had a short, trimmed beard.\nBoth men ran out of the complex\u2019s front gates, east on Decatur, then north, per witnesses.\n\u201cIt looks like they might have chased him a little bit, because there\u2019s a hat on once side of the parking lot and then the shots were fired on the other side,\u201d McGrath said.\nAnyone with information is asked to call Metro\u2019s homicide unit at 702-828-3521 or Crime Stoppers at 702-385-5555.\nAs of 10 p.m., homicide detectives had not yet determined a motive, but McGrath said \u201cwhatever the motive is, it\u2019s probably going to be something that\u2019s absolutely not necessary, senseless and didn\u2019t need to get shot over.\u201d\nThe county coroner\u2019s office will identify the person shot once his family has been notified.\nThis was the 95th confirmed homicide Metro has investigated so far this year.\nContact Rachel Crosby at rcrosby@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5290.
