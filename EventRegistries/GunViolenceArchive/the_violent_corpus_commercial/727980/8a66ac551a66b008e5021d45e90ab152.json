(KAKE) -\nA Wichita Police Official says a 16-year-old girl died after accidentally shooting herself in the basement of a northeast Wichita home.\nOfficers were called at around 2:15 a.m. to the report of a shooting in the 1300 block of North Erie, near Hillside. Lt Jason Stephens said the person who called 911 told dispatch a female had shot herself. Officers arrived on scene and found the girl in the basement, dead of an apparent gunshot wound.\n\"After interviewing several witnesses and investigating evidence at the scene, it was determined that, it does appear that the female accidentally shot herself,\" Lt. Stephens said.\nStephens said there were several people in their late teens playing with a shotgun in the basement prior to the shooting.\n\"There were six people in the basement. I really don't know at what varying times that number fluctuated. There were two adults and the rest were juveniles.\"\nStephens said one of the adults is 18-years-old and the other is in his 30s.\nStephens did not identify the girl who died, but said she did not live at the home and was there visiting. The shotgun belonged to someone who lives at the home.\nNo charges have been filed at this time.\n\"We no longer have a statute that really covers securing or the proper securing of weapons and things like that anymore,\" Stephens said.\nPolice are still working to determine if the firearm is owned legally.\nPrevious story:\nOne person is dead after a shooting in north Wichita early Saturday morning.\nDispatchers said officers responded to a shooting around 2 a.m. in the 1300th block of North Erie.\nWe expect to get an update about the investigation from officers after a media briefing Monday morning."}
