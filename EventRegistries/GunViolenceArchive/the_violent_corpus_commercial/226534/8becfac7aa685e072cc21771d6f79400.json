All five victims were under the age of 21.\n\u201cIn the living room, it was just matted down dirty carpet with burns in it. It was a big space that seemed like they were hosting parties,\u201d Chattanooga Police Department Captain Brian Cotter said.\nNeighbors told officers parties are often held at the house, making it a nuisance for the neighborhood. Reanita Carter told us in a previous interview she lived inside the home with three of her seven kids.

Cotter says it will also prevent another incident like what happened on Sunday.\n\u201cI was happy they condemned it and I'm happy they're moving on so I don't have to worry about shots fired in a neighborhood, people running across other people's yards shooting back at each other. We don't need that in a neighborhood and I'm glad to get rid of it,\u201d Cotter said.\nCarter spoke to us earlier this week about her worries over losing her housing voucher through the Chattanooga Housing Authority.\n\u201cI'm going to have to go back to being homeless and have my kids go from shelter to shelter until I find somewhere to stay.
