One shattered his 50-gallon fish tank, sending his crappie to the floor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s messed up out here,\u201d said Falkner, 67, who had been trading phone calls all morning with prospective landlords in an effort to move to a safer neighborhood.\n\u201cI could have been sitting there on the couch,\u201d said Falkner, pointing to the bullet hole in his window. \u201cShe usually sits on top of the couch too and looks out the window,\u201d he said, pointing to his dog, Peaches."}
