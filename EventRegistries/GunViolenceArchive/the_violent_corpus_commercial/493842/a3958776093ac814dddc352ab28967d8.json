He was just a child,' said Guidry. 'He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.'\nRelatives of Richardson told KRTK that the teen was due to celebrate his birthday next week, was an able student and worked at the local Dairy Queen.\nWillie Young, 21, and Randy Stewart, 18, were arrested on Monday in connection with the shooting.\nYoung is charged with deadly conduct while Stewart is charged with aggravated assault, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.\nIt was celebratory gunshots fired at the packed 18th birthday party attended by over 100 people that triggered the mass shooting that left two dead, two critically injured and 22 others injured in chaotic scenes where people jumped from second-floor windows to escape the shooting at the suburban Houston home.\nHarris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia said the gathering Saturday night was openly promoted using multiple social media sites, drew more than 100 people, most of them 17- to 19-year-olds, and became a 'birthday party gone wild.'\nHe said it appears partygoers were dancing in the home when someone armed with a pistol shot into the air in celebration. In the ensuing confusion, another person who was armed began firing into the crowd, Garcia said.\nYoung people then streamed into the narrow street to avoid the burst of gunshots that followed shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday.\n'Anytime you promote a birthday party on social media, you have no control over who to expect at your door,' Garcia said to KRTK.\n'What it does is indicate, that your saying to the social media world, 'I don't know who you are, but you're invited.' That's not a good practice.'\nThe initial shot was reportedly fired in celebration, which caused someone to react and fire randomly into the crowd.\n'It is just a horrible combination of immaturity, access to a firearm and the inability to control oneself,' Garcia said.\nPartygoer Shaniqua Brown \u2014 who said she heard about the party through Instagram, a photo-sharing app and website \u2014 told The Associated Press it 'was not rowdy at all.'\nShe said she first heard gunshots in the house and they continued outside as people fled and sought cover.\nOne anonymous witness said that the shooting continued for five minutes and described the horrific scene outside the house as he fled to safety.\n'I saw one guy. He was lying on the floor with blood leaking out of his mouth and off his body and stuff,' the witness said.\n'And I saw another girl on the floor, and she looked like she was in shock, but she was also bleeding.'\nAuthorities have given varying accounts of the number of people injured, but they clarified Sunday that 20 were hurt, with 16 suffering gunshot wounds and four others varying injuries such as a fracture and twisted ankles in the panic to flee.\nGarcia chastised the party organizers, who advertised the event on social media, saying 'you have no control on who to expect at your door.'\nAuthorities are searching for two gunmen, he said, one who\u2019s about 17 years old and the other believed to be about 22.\nGarcia said party organizers arranged to have people searched as they entered the home.\n'Anytime you have to factor in a bouncer and being searched at the door, you have already taken a turn for the worse,' he said.\nSheriff\u2019s spokesman Thomas Gilliland said earlier that deputies were confronted with 'mass chaos' when they responded to the call in the residential neighborhood about 25 miles northwest of Houston, adding that 'kids were literally everywhere.'\nHe said witnesses reported partygoers jumping from the second floor in their scramble to flee.\nMariah Boulden said the gathering was her birthday party. Boulden, who lives at the residence, said her brother and others were patting down people as they entered the home.\nAt least one parent was in the house, said Christina Garza, a spokeswoman with the sheriff's office.\nNo drugs or alcohol are suspected in the shooting.\nGarcia said Boulden's mother was in the home during the party.\nTwo men refused to be searched and walked away, she said, then apparently hopped a neighbor\u2019s fence and entered through a back gate.\n'They wasn\u2019t supposed to be here whoever they was,' Boulden said.\nShe said her family is planning a candlelight vigil at the home for the victims of the shooting.\nPools of blood were visible outside the two-story brick home Sunday, and the garage door was bent after people had pushed it upward while trying to escape.\nBruno Figueroa, who lives a few houses down the street, told The Associated Press he heard five to 10 shots.\nHe looked out his window and saw a crowd of at least 30 people running down his street.\n'Kids were running everywhere,' he said.\nFigueroa said people suddenly began ducking into back yards and behind vehicles in driveways, apparently trying to hide from a car that was slowly coming down the street. Figueroa said that from his upstairs window he could hear the people who were hiding nearby.\n'They were crying, yelling, \u2018My brother got shot,\u2019 \u2018Why did they do this?\u2019 he said.\nFigueroa said as soon as the slow-moving car rounded a corner and then sped away, the people who had been hiding gathered back in the street."}
