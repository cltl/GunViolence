She had traveled to Austin to visit her fiancee's family. She was with her fiancee on Sixth Street when she was shot.\nThree other women who suffered gunshot wounds were taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge, Austin police Chief of Staff Brian Manley said. Another person who was injured declined medical treatment.\nPolice have named 24-year-old Endicott McCray as a person of interest in the shooting.

His bond was set for $2 million.\nPolice were still searching for him Monday morning.\nAn individual was initially detained as a person of interest, but Manley later said the individual's connection to the case had not been determined. Police were interviewing that person and witnesses.\n\"With so many people being out at this time, there were a lot of people giving us descriptions, and those descriptions are consistent to a certain extent,\" Manley said. \"But as you would expect , not all the same.\"\nAnother shooting was reported at a parking garage several blocks away, near Eighth and Trinity streets, shortly after the incident on Sixth Street.\nPolice initially feared that an \"active shooter\" situation was unfolding, but Manley said investigators had determined the two cases were not related.\nWitnesses detained a suspect in the parking garage incident, and he was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. His name was not released.\n\"With this being shortly after 2 a.m., with the large crowds we have on Sixth Street at this time, all the individuals leaving the bars, it was a very chaotic scene \u2014 a lot of people running in different directions with all the gunshots that were coming out,\" Manley said.\nAustin police Chief Art Acevedo said the department would search tirelessly to identify and apprehend the person responsible for the shooting.\n\"On behalf of the Austin Police Department, we wish to extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the young woman who lost her life to this senseless act of violence and wish for a speedy recovery to the individuals wounded,\" Acevedo said in a written statement.\nAcevedo said anyone with video footage of the shootings or the aftermath on Sixth Street is asked to email police3@austintexas.gov.
