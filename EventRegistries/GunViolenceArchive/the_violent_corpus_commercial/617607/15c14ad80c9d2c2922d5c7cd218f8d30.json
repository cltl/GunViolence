Thirty-year-old Teqnika Marie Moultrie was walking down the crowded sidewalk with her wife and friends, after leaving Voodoo Doughnuts at 212 E. Sixth, when McCray opened fire.\nHe was captured outside of Atlanta, Georgia on Aug. 3 after being spotted at a bus station by a U.S. Marshals Task Force member. The marshal first noticed McCray because he was wearing a raincoat when it wasn\u2019t raining.\nPolice say the incident began when McCray got into a fight with his brother-in-law and took out his gun, aiming it at the man. McCray fired one shot into the ground and then raised his gun, pointing it sideways, and firing up to four more shots. Moultrie, considered an innocent bystander by police, died at the scene. Four others were injured in the shooting.\nThe four were taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge with life-threatening and non-life threatening injuries to the chest, thigh, ankle and buttock. One of the injured victims was part of a bachelorette party on Sixth Street that night.\nMcCray\u2019s bond is set at $2 million."}
