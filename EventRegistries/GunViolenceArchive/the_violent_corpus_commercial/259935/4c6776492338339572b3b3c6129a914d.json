Matt Blank of the St. Joseph County Police Department. \u201cOne of our officers had a car stopped literally right in the front of (The Oaks), and he heard the gunshots go off.\u201d\nPolice responded to the scene, where an estimated 500 party-goers were gathered. Four victims were found with gunshot wounds, one of which Blank described as \u201ca significant wound above the ankle.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody tried to flee the scene\u201d before officers were able to secure the area and lock everything down, Blank said.\nThree of the victims were taken by ambulance to an area hospital, where they were treated for \u201cnon-life threatening injuries,\u201d police said.\nA fourth victim fled as he was being treated inside the ambulance. \u201cApparently he dropped a little bit of marijuana on the floor of the ambulance, and he took off running,\u201d Blank said.\nSt. Joseph County detectives investigating the shooting have \u201cone guy they\u2019re looking at,\u201d although no arrests have been made, Blank noted.\nSunday morning, workers milled around inside The Oaks cleaning empty beer bottles and leftover trash still visible on the grounds outside the building and assessing damages.\nOne man, who didn\u2019t give his name, said the original plans for the event \u201cstarted out at about 80 people\u201d before spiraling out of control with gunshots.\nThe man, who said he didn\u2019t know the reason for the event, admitted, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what we thought it was supposed to be.\u201d\nAnyone with information about the shooting or the missing victim should contact Capt. Randy Kaps at 574-235-9569, or 574-235-9611."}
