The bloodshed Thursday has added to their pain. Lake County sheriff\u2019s Lt. Corey Paulich said Bravo refused to give authorities a statement in the wake of the incident.\nBut it appears Bravo was looking for a woman described as his wife \u2014 it wasn\u2019t clear Friday if they were legally married \u2014 when he arrived at her mother\u2019s home around 2:16 a.m. Thursday, angered by the younger woman\u2019s recent decision to end their three-year relationship and seek full custody of two young children, neither of whom was present when the shooting occurred, family members and friends said.\nThe woman often sought refuge at her mother\u2019s house during what family members said was an abusive relationship, so Bravo had reason to think she would be there.\nBut Brown, her aunt, and the young woman\u2019s mother, Stephanie Brown, had her hide under a bed and stay there after Bravo burst in. She escaped the shooting unharmed. Authorities did not provide the woman\u2019s name.\nBravo shot Theresa Brown in the face, spraying buckshot that struck her 6-year-old daughter, who reportedly used her slain mom\u2019s cellphone to call her older brother for help, Ammar said.\nStephanie Brown and her husband, Robert Brown, also suffered gunshot wounds. Robert Brown lost a large chunk of his forearm, and his wife was hurt in the shoulder, then forced outside and into Bravo\u2019s van, though she drove away and escaped when he went back inside.\nWhen Bravo returned, he left the area in one of the victim\u2019s cars, though he soon abandoned it outside the rancheria.\nHe eluded authorities in the initial hours after the gunfire, during a search that included help from the Sonoma County sheriff\u2019s helicopter crew. Someone at a local elementary school saw a public alert that included Bravo\u2019s photo and told authorities that he was on the campus later Thursday morning.\nPaulich said it was possible he was trying to visit a family member who attends Pomo Elementary School, though it was not clear.\nBravo was arrested without incident and was being held on $1 million bail.\nChief Deputy District Attorney Richard Hinchcliff said Bravo would be arraigned at 3 p.m. Monday in the county courthouse at Lakeport.\nThe youngest victim suffered a broken arm and had pellets throughout her arm. She had surgery on Thursday and was being released from the hospital on Friday, Ammar said. Both of the injured adults also were reportedly in stable condition."}
