I absolutely started loosing my mind. I didn't know if it was my son that got hurt or not.\"\nLambert never thought her son would be in danger working at this Raising Cane's in Shenandoah. She says it's not the kind of area that sees violent crime and when she heard a robbery suspect had been killed inside the restaurant she was afraid for her son.\nPHOTOS: Officer-involved shooting at Raising Cane's\nLambert said, \"I was almost in tears, very upset.\"\nAnd with good reason. Sheriff's seputies say other Raising Cane's locations have been robbed over the last few weeks and that's why this location hired an off duty Montgomery County Sheriff's deputy.\nDetectives say when the suspect came in Tuesday night he had a gun and grabbed an employee. That's when the off-duty deputy confronted the suspect. All of it happened in front of customers and employees.\nEmployee Bralin Henderson said, \"Officer Skip, that's the guy who saved the day. He came in and he pretty much you know he pretty much had the gun out, like, you know 'drop the weapon' because he had his hand on a gun and he was like, 'no, I'm not going to hurt her' that was his exact words and he said, \"I said drop the weapon.\" And he still wouldn't listen and he fired five times into his chest at point blank range.\"\nThere were several customers inside the restaurant as this happened, one father telling me his daughter is still shaken up by all this.\nMontgomery County detectives are still trying to figure out if the suspect was alone, or if he had someone in car waiting outside, they say no vehicles were found so they are not sure if there were other suspects or not."}
