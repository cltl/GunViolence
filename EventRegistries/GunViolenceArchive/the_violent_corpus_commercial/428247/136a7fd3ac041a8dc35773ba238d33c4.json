Police now say four people were shot at a home on West Boulevard. MEDIC took three of the victims to the hospital and police say a fourth showed up there later.\nPolice say none of the injuries are life-threatening. The shooting happened in the 1900 block of West Boulevard near a house neighbors say is a party house.\n\"Stray bullet like that doesn't have a name on it, could have gotten me you know, I'm shocked,\" said Vanessa McDonald, who lives down the street.\nAntwaun Jacksun, another neighbor who lives across the street, says the house where it happened is a hot spot for late night parties.\n\"You leave the club, you come here for more drinks and girls, party,\" said Jacksun.\nJacksun said he saw the shooting happen from his front porch.\n\"Shooting around here pretty regular now, but when he got out of the car with a gun I thought he was playing,\" said Jacksun, \"Until I heard the shots, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, jump in the car with a gun and then I heard screaming.\"\nShell casings were left in the street and bullet holes were also sprinkled throughout the front window of the home. MEDIC transported three people to CMC Main around 5 a.m. Saturday morning.\n\"It's pretty safe, never heard anything like that over here before,\" said McDonald.\nBut according to CMPD, 14 instances ranging from assault to drug violations to vandalism have happened on the 1900 block in the last six months. Vanessa McDonald has only lived down the street for a year, but now she's ready to move to protect her family.\n\"I will not be here another year, I can't do it, My nerves is rattled right now,\" said McDonald.\nAs police investigate the shooting, neighbors hope the gun violence will stop and all involved will recover."}
