After the third River District power outage linked to the Bridge Street Substation in 18 months, the city is taking a closer look at substation transformers.\n\u201cAll existing substation transformers will be inspected and ranked based on failure possibility,\u201d Danville Utilities Director Jason Grey said. \u201cFuture transformer replacements will be based on this study.\u201d\nHigh:\nDanville is considering the development of a bike share program. Councilman Lee Vogler suggested the idea after seeing a similar one during a visit to Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 2012.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that expensive, especially if it\u2019s privately funded out of the gate,\u201d Vogler said. \u201cThis is not going to be any kind of major expense in our budget at all.\u201d\nThe start-up cost should be under $50,000, with annual maintenance costs of around $5,000.\nLow:\nSpray-paint wielding vandals continue to hit Danville churches and other public places; the latest included a swastika and the words \u201cWhite Pride\u201d on a wall as well as damage to a Danville church and another place in the city.\nHigh:\nAs General Assembly Republicans and Gov. Terry McAuliffe continue to fight over whether felons who have paid their debt to society can automatically get their rights restored, we should consider the words of Danville resident and ex-offender Richard Harris.\n\u201cI\u2019m almost a citizen,\u201d Harris said.\nAfter McAuliffe restored the rights of more than 200,000 people this spring, some said that would tip the scales in November\u2019s election to Democrat Hillary Clinton. But 200,000 ex-offenders didn\u2019t take the chance McAuliffe gave them and register to vote \u2014 it was more like 13,000, including Harris.\nTo Richard Harris and all the other ex-offenders who are working toward becoming \u2014 once again \u2014 a citizen, we hope that their path to the voting booth won\u2019t be blocked again.\nHigh:\nAnd finally this week, the work of a 13-year-old animal shelter volunteer has led to the creation of The Little Critter Bliss Fund to benefit rabbits, hamsters, birds, guinea pigs and other small animals.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really get adopted a lot and they need friends,\u201d shelter junior volunteer Mia Trotter said.\nEditorials are the consensus view of the Danville Register & Bee\u2019s editorial board: Publisher Steven W.
