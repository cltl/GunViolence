They say it was not a gun.\nChristopher Roupe, 17, was in the ROTC at Woodland High School and wanted to join the Marines. His friends said he looked after them.\n\u201cHe was a good kid. He always hung out with me and he took up for me,\u201d said William Corson.\nRoupe's young life ended Friday night when Euharlee police officers showed up at the door of his home in the Eagle View Mobile Home Park to serve a probation violation warrant for his father.\nA female police officer told GBI investigators that Roupe pointed a gun at her when he opened the door.\n\u201cIt just doesn't add up,\u201d said Cole Law who is representing the Roupe family.\nLaw said Roupe was about to watch a movie.\n\u201cWe don't know where that statement came from. The eyewitnesses on the scene clearly state that he had a Wii controller in his hand. He heard a knock at the door. He asked who it was, there was no response so he opened the door and upon opening the door he was immediately shot in the chest,\u201d Law said.\nNeighbors said they ran to the home after they heard the shot.\n\u201cWhen we got up there, they said there was a Wii remote in his hand and she shot him,\u201d said Tia Howard, who lives a few doors down.\nNeighbor Ken Yates said he saw the female officer moments after the fatal shot.\n\u201cThis is tragic. She came out of this house. She put her head in her hands and she was sobbing. Supposedly, he opened the door with a BB gun and in my opinion I think he was playing a game with his neighborhood buddies,\u201d said Yates.\nThe officer is on administrative leave, which is standard procedure after an officer-involved shooting.\nThe GBI said the autopsy is complete, and they will turn over evidence to Cherokee Judicial Circuit District Attorney Rosemary Greene\u2019s office.\nThe funeral for Roupe is planned for Friday."}
