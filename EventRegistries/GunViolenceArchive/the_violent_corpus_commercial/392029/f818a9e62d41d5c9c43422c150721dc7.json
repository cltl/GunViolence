They were there to help the 3-year-old girl next door.\n\"My kids play with them all the time,\" Litton said.\nThat's why it was shocking for Litton to learn a gun had been left out and picked up by the little girl's 4-year-old brother.\n\"It's our understanding it was recovered from a common area of the house and was loaded ready at hand,\" Columbus Police Detective Jay Fulton said.\nPolice say the mother, her boyfriend and three kids were staying with the homeowner. The boyfriend was at work. His gun was left out at the home. The little boy got ahold of it and it discharged at close range to his sister.\nDuring the 911 call, the caller can be heard explaining a child was playing with the gun and another child got shot in the back of the neck but the child was breathing and conscious.\nPolice believe the family had the gun ready, fearing for their safety after recent problems. Litton said she\u2019s nervous because she had no idea her children had been around it.\n\"Yes, because she's been over there quite a few times especially in the past three years,\" Litton said.\nPolice think the family narrowly escaped a real tragedy. They hope it's a lesson for all.\n\"Just hope that this can serve as a reminder to keep these firearms secured,\" Det. Fulton said.\nOnce the investigation is complete, detectives will talk with the prosecutor's office about possible charges.\nSafeKids.org offers these tips to keep your kids safe around guns:\nStore guns in a locked location, unloaded, out of the reach and sight of children.\nStore ammunition in a separate locked location, out of the reach and sight of children.
