Police have not released the names of the victims, pending notification of all next of kin, and so we cannot share further details about the students at this time.'\nLockwood wrote that 'a team of counselors, school psychologists, and social workers will be providing support to any students, faculty or staff members in need throughout the coming days.'"}
