The house he was found in front of is located about a mile from the apartment complex where he lives, police said.\nNeighbors said they heard gunshots around 10 p.m. on Wednesday.\nFamily members said that Ross left his home around 7 p.m. and wasn't seen again.\n\"Jeremiah was great,\" said Dewanna Crawford, the victim's aunt. \"He was always a loner. He liked to go out and do things by himself, so when he would go out, we would expect for him to come home, because that's just what he did. He will be missed, truly.\"\nRoss had moved to the area from Stockbridge in September, according to his family.\nThe investigation into the shooting is ongoing.\n\"It's a 15-year-old, and despite what he may or may not have been doing at that location, a 15-year-old has lost his life,\" said Mjr. Joseph Woodall with the Clayton County Police Department. \"It brings concern to us all and we're going to treat it accordingly and hope to get to the bottom of it shortly.\"\nAnyone with information on the death is asked to call 911."}
