Right now, investigators with the IMPD believe the death is the result of a tragic accident.\nThe boy was identified Monday as Noah Sarver.\nNeighbors say Sarver was a good boy just didn\u2019t understand the dangers of playing with a firearm.\n\u201cEverybody was out here crying. It was really sad and to hear his mom crying when they brought his body out, it was sad,\u201d said neighbor Cindy Masters.\nCindy and several other neighbors didn\u2019t hear the fatal gunshot that killed him, but they did hear the boy\u2019s father frantically calling for help.\n\u201cI came outside and all I heard was him yelling for help. He was running back and forth yelling for help,\u201d said neighbor Paul Martin.\nNeighbors say the victim had been playing with a cousin before the shooting. That cousin told neighbors the boys found the gun in this alley behind the victim\u2019s home.\nJust a few minutes later, it\u2019s believed Noah pulled the trigger accidentally killing himself.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe Noah realized the gun was loaded and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d said Masters.\n\u201cAt this point in the investigation, from witness statements and other evidence, we believe this to be a tragic accident,\u201d said IMPD Capt. Richard Riddle.\nRiddle would not say how child got gun, if in fact it was found in the alley or if it belonged to the father.\n\u201cOur investigators are trying to determine how the child and the other child had this gun in their possession,\u201d said Riddle.\nNeighbors say they don\u2019t blame the boy\u2019s father for the shooting.\n\u201cI want people to know the father is a great father. He\u2019s a good man,\u201d said Martin.\nPolice still have to complete their investigation to determine if there was any negligence that could result in criminal charges. The story is also a reminder for parents to talk to their kids about the dangers of playing with guns."}
