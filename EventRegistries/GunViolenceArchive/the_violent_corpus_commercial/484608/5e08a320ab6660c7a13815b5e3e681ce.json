The girl was struck in the leg. She was in stable condition early Wednesday, police told Channel 2.\nPolice said several shooters exchanged gunfire, and a neighbor reported that several bullets went through her apartment and nearly struck her boys who were in bed.\nPolice are investigating if the drive-by is related to another shooting reported in the past month.\nKen Meadows, a resident in the Paradise East complex for about one year, said shootings happen once or twice a month near the Paradise East complex.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting ridiculous,\u201d he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nMeadows, who was at work during the most recent shooting, said there have been at least five shootings at the apartment complex in the year he has lived there.\nIn the last shooting, he said a child who was looking out her apartment window almost got hit accidentally following an incident with a previous tenant.\nEven though shootings are regular occurrences near the complex, children injured in gunfire is a different story, Meadows said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking to see a kid get hit,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean especially over something that probably was senseless.\u201d\n\u2014 Staff photographer John Spink contributed to this article."}
