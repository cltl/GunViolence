Initially the 14-year-old told detectives he was shot by someone in a drive-by but couldn't provide police with a description. JSO later determined the story was a lie. It turns out the 14-year-old victim and his 14-year-old friend were playing with a rifle when he was shot accidentally at home.\nDetectives say the pair came clean when they were confronted with the evidence.\nJacksonville Police say the boy was shot at least once in the lower torso. He is in stable condition and the injury is not considered life threatening.\nThis happened outside of the teen\u2019s apartment off 6th and Myrtle.\nThey won't be charged in the accidental shooting but an investigation into gun ownership continues."}
