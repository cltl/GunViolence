Bloomington Police Capt. Steve Kellams said Kirchmeier was in critical condition but stable. Doctors do not anticipate a change at this time.\nKirchmeier was outside the apartment smoking with his girlfriend when his roommate, Jason Cox, another IU student, picked up a Smith & Wesson .40-caliber handgun. He then pointed the handgun through the window at Kirchmeier.\nKirchmeier turned toward the window at the same time Cox fired and he was shot in the mouth, Kellams said.\nKirchmeier's girlfriend called the police while Cox tried to help his roommate until authorities arrived. Cox said he did not intend to actually fire at Kirchmeier.\nBPD obtained a search warrant and discovered the .40-caliber handgun and a 12-gauge shotgun hidden in the couch. Officers also found a number of smoking devices and bongs, according to police reports. Cox appeared to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs at the time of the shooting.\nCox, 21, was charged with aggravated battery and criminal recklessness and is currently booked in jail.\nDominick Jean\nLike what you are reading?
