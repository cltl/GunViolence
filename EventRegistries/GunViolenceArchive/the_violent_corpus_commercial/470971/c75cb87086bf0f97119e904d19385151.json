By press time, she was in a medically induced coma and in stable condition.\nIn remarks to the almost 100 people gathered at the vigil, Kiehne described Pullam as a \"strong-willed\" person who \"doesn't take no for an answer.\"\n\"We thought it was important with the situation that happened, to give our kids and staff an opportunity to get together. If we were in session, we would be there during the day and have counselors on hand for our kids. But, it being break, the kids are kind of on their own.\"\nFirst United Methodist youth pastor Adam Fears led the group in prayer, offering a moment of silence for Pullam's recovery.\nHigh-school employee Cathy Powell, who attended the event, said she was there because she believes in the power of prayer.\n\"I believe God can touch her,\" Powell said. \"I have seen worse situations and seen God pull people through. She is a very happy, kind and polite person, and she needs people to back her up in prayer. The Bible says, 'Where two or three are gathered together, there I am in the midst.'\"\nClassmates and friends also described Powell as a kind person who would help anyone in need.\n\"It's really sad,\" said classmate Chelsea Becker. \"She was so bubbly, and she was so active. She would help anybody in any situation. During the blood drive, I passed out, and she helped me right then -- she had emergency training.\"\nClassmate Abby Johnston said she was in shock when she heard about Pullam's injuries.\n\"When I found out the news, it really shocked me and made me sad,\" Johnston said.\nPullam's father, Joe, was handling a black-powder firearm he believed was unloaded when he \"inadvertently squeezed the trigger, and it went off,\" according to previous reports.\nThe shot traveled through the wall and struck Kaitlyn in the shoulder, but the bullet exploded and shrapnel struck her in the face. Bullet fragments also entered her lungs, authorities said."}
