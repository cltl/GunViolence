Three of the victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries, while another was shot in the stomach and is fighting for his life.\n\u201cBeing a mother and knowing that\u2019s your child and your child is shot, you\u2019re not hearing where she\u2019s shot or nothing, I freaked out,\u201d said Lisa McMillian, the mother of victim Latoya Kennedy.\nMcMillian hasn\u2019t slept since she got the call at 3:30 a.m. saying that her daughter was shot in the leg.\nMcMillian said Kennedy wasn\u2019t at the club, but at the park next door, getting an early start on celebrating her birthday.\n\u201cI wish they\u2019d get guns off the street. I mean, when we were coming up, we fist-fought,\u201d she said.\nPolice said all four victims went to Halifax Medical Center, where they told police what happened.\nNo one was able to get a good look at the shooter. McMillian said she\u2019s worried what could happen if there\u2019s more violence outside the club, which is feet away from Bethune-Cookman University dorms.\n\u201cI thank God that there wasn\u2019t (a) death involved, but it could have been much worse. Innocent people, I mean, nobody should get shot, whether you\u2019re innocent or not,\u201d said McMillian.\nDetectives are working to identify the gunman. They do know that the shooter was about 4 \u00bd-feet tall, black and likely to be between 20 and 30 years old.\nAnyone with information is asked to call police."}
