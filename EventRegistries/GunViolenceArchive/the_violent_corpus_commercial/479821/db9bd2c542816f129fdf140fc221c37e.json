Four people were sent to the hospital with bullet and shrapnel wounds, police said.\n\u201cAn argument broke out inside and spilled to the outside,\u201d said Lt. Scott Spratt of the Marion Police Department.\nSpratt said the suspect reached in his waistband, pulled out a gun and fired three to four shots.\n\u201cIn the process he hit a few people. It appears he was shooting low,\u201d Spratt said.\nThe weapon was a 40-caliber semi-automatic, according to Spratt.\nFour victims were transported to the hospital, one to Mission Trauma Center with what was thought to be serious injuries, and three to McDowell with non-life threatening injuries, according to a press release from the McDowell County EMS.\nThere are leads on the suspect, but as of Saturday afternoon no one was in custody.\nVic Douglas, a cook at Vortex, called 911 after the bartender ran in and said shots were being fired. Douglas said there were about 30 people at Vortex last night.\n\u201cWe have been quiet for so long. We haven\u2019t had any trouble,\u201d said Douglas.\nThe Marion Police Department, the McDowell County Sheriff\u2019s Office, and the McDowell County EMS responded and assisted at the crime scene."}
