In an effort to help them out, a family friend started climbing through a window. That's when a gun fell out of his pocket and went off.\nA bullet accidentally fired from the gun hit the 4-year-old.\nThe child was taken to Le Bonheur Children's Hospital in non-critical condition.\nCopyright 2016 WMC Action News 5.
