He was a good all-around player.\"\nWhen the death of a teen occurs under similar circumstances, friends often say that the young man who was killed was \"trying to get back on track,\" Sackmaster said. Hill was \"not like that,\" Sackmaster said. \"He was on track. He did make good choices. He was an honor student and for the most part was around the right kids.\"\nThe teen was known as \"Papi\" to family members, said Hill's aunt, Tamecka McClatchey of Chicago.\nDekeisana Hill, 22, said her brother was a \"sweet, innocent kid. He played pranks, giggled. He was something else.\"\nShow more...\nDekeisana Hill said her brother was excited when she introduced him last summer to a former high school classmate of hers - Fred Van Vleet, a Rockfordian who recently signed with the Toronto Raptors. \"He was spoiled because he got straight A's and B's,\" Dekeisana Hill said.\nHill and two other teens were shot after an argument they were not involved in, Rockford police said. Neighbors said residents of the home often hosted parties. Police responded to calls of shots fired about 1:30 a.m. and found the 15-year-old with a head wound. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital.\nTwo females - one 17 years old, the other, 13 - were treated and released from a local hospital, police said.\nAn autopsy showed preliminary cause of death \"to be consistent with a shooting,\" said Bill Hintz, chief deputy Winnebago County coroner. He said he would not say how many times nor where Hill had been shot because the homicide investigation is ongoing.\nNo arrests have been announced.\nMcClatchey said her sister, Nekita Hill, found out about her son's death via Facebook messages being posted by his friends. \"That's a terrible way to find out,\" McClatchey said.\nOn her Facebook page, Nekita Hill posted at 9:09 a.m. Sunday: \"God plz don't tell me my son gone.\"\nOn her son's Facebook page, Nekita Hill posted this about 12:30 p.m. today: \"The only reason I'm on FB is to witness all the love ppl have for my baby Nittyworldd Greg. My heart is broken but it helps to know how much he was loved & respected by his peers. Papi was too cool and I know he will forever live in all of us.\"\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00aaMcClatchey said her sister moved her family to Rockford when Greg Hill was in grade school to escape violence in Chicago.\nDekeisana Hill said her brother was often at the YMCA playing basketball. \"My mom is strict on us, but because he is a trusted teen,\" she said her mom allowed him to go out that night.\nSaundra Pounds of Rockford said her two teen daughters were close friends of Hill when they lived in the same southwest side neighborhood. He'd enter their home without knocking.\nAnne Reed, 16, Pounds' daughter, said Hill would grab a package of Ramen noodles from the top of the family's refrigerator to take home with him.\nSaid Autum Reed, 15: \"He was the one who would make me smile. ... Heaven couldn't wait for my boy, but at least I know he's watching over me now,\" she said.\nPounds said Hill was a good kid and that her older daughters had attended parties at that same Green Dale home without trouble. \"It was some people that had no business there; they were not invited,\" she said.\nThe girls and their mother were among about 50 people who attended a candlelight vigil for Hill at 13th Street and Seventh Avenue on Sunday night. Pounds said she wants her teen daughters to talk with a counselor, but \"because we don't have insurance, you are basically placed on a waiting list for counseling.\"\nAnyone with information regarding this incident is asked to call Rockford police at 779-500-6500 or Crime Stoppers 815-963-7867.\nHill was the year's fifth juvenile homicide victim. It's the highest annual number of homicide victims younger than 18 since 2011 when there were four.\nThere have been 12 homicides total in Rockford so far in 2016. That number is slightly fewer than the 15 homicides there had been in Rockford at this time last year.\nIn all, there were 19 Rockford homicides in 2015.\nSixteen Rockford homicide victims since 2011 have been younger than 18.\nRegister Star reporter Jeff Kolkey contributed to this report.\nGeorgette Braun: 815-987-1331; gbraun@rrstar.com; @GeorgetteBraun"}
