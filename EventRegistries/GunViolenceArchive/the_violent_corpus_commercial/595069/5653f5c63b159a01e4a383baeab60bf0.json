He died before paramedics arrived.\n\"The violence has got to stop. The crime has got to stop,\" said neighbor, Tekia Wilker.\nPolice say Tucker was not the killer's intended target.\n3rdWard residents look on as police continue investigating.

Everybody fighting against each other instead of helping each other,\" said Wilker.\nBut how much can one family take?\nTucker's younger brother was killed two weeks earlier. Daquarius Tucker, 19, was one of five people shot on July 4th during a block party in the Fourth Ward. So far, no arrests have been made in that case.\nOne man was arrested this morning, less than a mile from where Demarcus Tucker was gunned down.\nOriginally, two people were taken into custody but police say it's likely only one will be charged with Tucker's death. That man's name has not been released yet.\nWe're following this story on Eyewitness News.
