Speakers especially singled out one of the dead, Charles Jackson, a father of three, nicknamed \"Screwball.\" A styrofoam cup sign pushed into a fence read \"We 'heart' U Screwball.\"\nFamilies sat in lawn chairs and listened as Pastor Elmo Johnson led them in prayer. \"Please have mercy on our Fourth Ward,\" Johnson, pastor at the Rose of Sharon Baptist Church, prayed. \"We love this Fourth Ward you put us in.\"\nDeric Muhammad, an activist whose family is originally from Fourth Ward, told the crowd: \"Last night the block was shut down in hate, tonight we want to shut it down in love.\"\nBefore Monday's shooting, witnesses estimated more than 1,000 people had gathered for the block party on Wilson between Andrews and Saulnier. Grammy-nominated Houston rapper Paul Wall, the biggest name on the bill, had hyped the audience for their clear view of \"Freedom Over Texas,\" which was happening footsteps away across Allen Parkway.\n\"Three or four males showed up with guns and started shooting,\" said Sgt. Derrick Fontenot, a Houston Police Department homicide investigator. On Tuesday, he called the incident \"\"intentional\" but was reluctant to identify a motive or provide descriptions of the assailants.\nWitnesses and community members said they believe one of the dead men was a target for a revenge killing to settle the score on a murder in another neighborhood.\nBy Tuesday evening, only one of the dead men had been identified officially by authorities. Jamal Dataunte Dixon-Lackey, 26, of Houston was one of the three men fatally shot around 10:30 p.m. Monday.\nRelatives and friends identified another man, Charles Jackson, as the second decedent. Known as \"Screwball,\" he was described by loved ones as a devoted father of three small children who was a steady volunteer at the neighborhood's Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church.\nA third deceased man's name has not been disclosed by authorities or loved ones.\nAll five of the wounded were rushed to local hospitals late Monday, where three of the men died. The child and the other man, 37, were expected to survive, though details of their injuries and conditions were not released.\nParty tents pitched on a grassy lot were still standing Tuesday morning. Folding tables held barbecue sauce, white bread, aluminum pans and other trappings of a cookout. Rolling coolers remained parked in the grass.\nOn the other side of the police tape, investigators made their final rounds amid shell casings and discarded food containers.\nDeonicia Curry returned to the neighborhood Tuesday morning to retrieve her car, which was sequestered by the police investigation overnight, and talk to people about the loss of her friend Screwball.\nThe 33-year-old attended the party with her 3-year-old daughter, mother, grandmother as well as about two dozen relatives and close friends. She said when the gunshots began, people dropped their belongings and started running.\n\"You were just trying to get your baby and go home,\" she said. \"Everyone comes out, watches the fireworks, we barbecue and we have fun. But this time, my friend was just trying to enjoy the Fourth of July with his kid and someone walked up on him and shot him and another innocent bystander. It makes no sense. It's sad. A lady has to tell her kids their Daddy is gone. A mama loses her son.\"\nTears began streaming down Curry's face as she thought back to the episode that took Jackson's life.\n\"I guess God needed him more than we did,\" she said between sobs. \"This is so sad.\"\nShe vowed that 2016 was her last time attending the event.\nJackson's great-aunt, Rosaland Jackson, said the party happened beside her family's corner store, which was the focal point of the block party.\n\"A lot of strange sounds went off and that's when everyone started running. We knew it was some gunshots,\" the 56-year-old said Tuesday morning as she walked around the area seemingly in a daze. \"Everybody was scrambling trying to run to safety. Hundreds and hundreds of people. Adults and kids.\"\nShortly, someone came in the store and said Screwball had been shot.\n\"We're just living in cruel times where a man has no love for mankind,\" she said. \"We will heal by grace and mercy. Charles knew God. He was a blessing around this neighborhood. We just need to stop a lot of the nonsense.\"\nFor John Burns, he not only lost a distant cousin, but a best friend and an annual homecoming he's been organizing for the last few years.\nLike Curry, he's finished with the event as well as his other block parties, sports tournaments and stop-the-violence gatherings \"for the hood,\" he said.\n\"It's me and him all day every day,\" he said of Screwball. \"We do everything together. He's all about his kids. He'd do whatever it takes for them. He's all about his family.\"\nBurns, a DJ and rapper, was coordinating artists between minding his laptop and speakers on a stage outside of the store when the gunfire erupted. He ushered his girlfriend and one of his children into the building, then someone beckoned him to check on his friend.\nHe cradled Jackson in his arms, he said, then went with the injured man's father to rush him to St. Joseph Hospital downtown. Screwball didn't make it.\nBurns, 34, believes the assailants used the opportunity of a thick crowd and the diversion of firecrackers popping off to kill.\nThe episode of cold reality imitated art in the worst way. Earlier this year, Burns performed on a tribute rap video called \"Another Day\" that celebrated the lives of more than a dozen young men whose lives were snatched by violence. The short film shows Charles Jackson sitting with Burns in a Fourth Ward cemetery \u2013 backed by the Houston skyline \u2013 reminiscing about people gone too soon.\nA sung chorus line repeats throughout the song: \"Wish I could get another day.\" The final image is REST IN PEACE on a black background.\nA $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the lone shooter or the gunmen.\nAnyone with information on identities of the suspects in this case is urged to contact the HPD Homicide Division at 713-308-3600 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS (8477).\nFauzeya Rahman contributed to this report."}
