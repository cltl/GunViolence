Three patients taken to the hospital had been discharged, according to Memorial Hermann Hospital.\nPolice have not formally confirmed the shooter's name, but neighbors and vehicle records identify him as Nathan Desai. The alleged shooter was fatally shot while exchanging gunfire with officers, according to HPD.\nThe active shooting scene was first reported around 6:30 a.m. when firefighters were called to help a shooting victim on Weslayan near Bissonnet.

The injured patients were said to be drivers or passengers in the vehicles that were struck.\nPolice tracked down and \"engaged\" with the shooter, who was eventually \"neutralized,\" HFD said.

She said both officers and first responders have to be vigilant in situations like these.\n'We have to ensure that as first responders\u2026not just the Houston Police Department, but all of us that we're prepared for these types of incidents, because obviously they are occurring,\" she said.\nA shelter in place for the area has since been lifted, but police still ask for anyone with information to call investigators at 713-308-3600.\n(\u00a9 2017 KHOU)"}
