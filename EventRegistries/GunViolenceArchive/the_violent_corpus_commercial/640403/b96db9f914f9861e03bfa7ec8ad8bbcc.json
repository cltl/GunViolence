After getting a tip that the boy was at his friend\u2019s house, officers went to the scene and called in crisis negotiators.\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously a kid in crisis. He\u2019s making bad decisions, he\u2019s got two guns, and he\u2019s 14,\u201d Orr said. \u201cAll we want to do is to keep him and the community safe.\u201d\nAll of the residents left the house at officers\u2019 request, and officers and crisis negotiators talked and texted with the boy for hours, Orr said. Neighbors were alerted to stay away from the home because an armed person was inside.\nWhen the teen\u2019s friend came out, he told police the teen had a handgun and had fired one round inside the house but hadn\u2019t aimed at anyone, Orr said. At that point, police backed off, set up officers around the house to protect the people in the neighborhood, and brought in crisis negotiators to talk to the boy, the sheriff\u2019s office reports. Kuna police found the boys parents and were working with them, ACSO reports.\n\u201cPolice continued to talk to the boy for another hour or so,\u201d an ACSO news release said. \u201cHe told them he didn\u2019t want to come out, that he didn\u2019t want to go to the hospital or go to jail. Other times, he seemed like he wanted to come out.\u201d\n\u201cThen he stopped answering the phone or texting. Officers heard the sound of a single gunshot from inside around 5:45 p.m.\u201d\nPolice entered the house immediately and found the boy, who had suffered a single gunshot wound, Orr said. Paramedics, already at the scene, treated him and rushed him to Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise, he said.\nThe teen had been identified as a suspect in a reported arson behind an LDS building at 315 East Deer Flat Road early in the morning of July 10. The blaze destroyed two storage units holding donations for Deseret Industries, ACSO said at the time. Two 18-year-olds playing Pokemon Go in the church's parking lot called dispatchers around 4 a.m. and reported seeing two teens running away from the burning building."}
