I knew that something was wrong, but I had no idea it was like that,\u201d says neighbor Don Fernelius. \u201cI'm very happy that they are going to be alright.\u201d\nDespite there being non-life threatening injuries, police say his could have ended worse.\n\u201cWe always think that things like this are just obvious to gun owners, unfortunately now a days with people's hectic lives and everything that's going on for people, whether they are legal licensed carriers or not, if they are in possession of a hand gun they need to know where that is at all times,\u201d explains Chief Gregory.\nPolice want to stress how important it is to keep guns in a safe place and out of the reach of kids."}
