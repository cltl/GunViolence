The child was with his family, being pushed in a stroller on the street when he was struck by the gunfire.\nPolice spokesman Frank Bonifacio said investigators continued to interview witnesses Friday to determine whether the shooting was accidental. They were also investigating whether the boy was shot outside the police substation or outside his home on 73rd Avenue.\n\u201cThis was unfortunate, and it\u2019s going to be a long haul but thankfully the child is expected to recover,\u201d Bonifacio said. \u201cWe do have some witnesses who have not yet spoken to investigators and we\u2019re looking into this being an accidental discharge. We don\u2019t think there\u2019s any threat to that neighborhood. They (the family) were not targeted.\u201d\nAs of Friday, no suspects had been arrested in connection with the shooting.\nAnyone with information about the case is asked to call police at 510-238-3426.\nContact Natalie Neysa Alund at 510-293-2469.
