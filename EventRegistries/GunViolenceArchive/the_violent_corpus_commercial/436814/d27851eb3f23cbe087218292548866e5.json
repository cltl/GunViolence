Right now they are calling this an unintentional shooting.\nA 911 call was made just after 9 a.m. that a 2-year-old had been shot in a home on Golden Eagle Way.\nAuthorities say crews arrived on scene as quickly as possible to rush Abagail to Mission Hospital by ambulance. Because of the weather conditions, transportation by the MAMA helicopter was not possible.\nAbagail was pronounced dead by the time she made it to the hospital. Maj. Frank Stout with the Henderson County Sheriff's Office says he doesn't think the helicopter would have made a difference.\n\"It's a very, very traumatic situation for everybody involved,\" Stout said. \"We're going to take this very slowly, very deliberately, before any charges or any talk of charges are made.\"\nThe question of who might face charges is still one that likely will have to wait. They say this was an accidental shooting and investigators are still trying to figure out who was handling the gun when it went off.\nDeputies say there were three other children in the home, ages 7, 3 and 4 months old. Abagail did not live in this home.\n\"There's a lot of questions as to how many children where there, who the parents were, the adults who were supervising the children,\" Stout said. \"There's just a lot of things and it's very early on in the investigation to get any of those answers.\"\nA man in the neighborhood told News 13 one of his family members was caring for the girl."}
