Turrentine, 29, faces an endangering the welfare of a child charge, along with charges of armed criminal action and possession of a controlled substance.\nCourt records state Turrentine accidentally shot himself and his daughter while he was cleaning his 9mm gun. Inside the family's home, a handgun, AR-15 rifle and a substance believed to be marijuana were discovered.\nThe Kansas City Police Department said the shooting happened at 7:47 p.m. Sunday. The family arrived at Research Medical Center.\nThe daughter remains in critical and stable condition with reported damage to her pelvis and spine.\n\"We need to take responsibility for our weapons,\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said.\nBaker says she can't imagine having to live with the consequences of something like this.\n\"Imagine living with the fact that someone got harmed with your gun, a child got harmed with your gun. I can't imagine having to live with that consequence,\" she said.\nProsecutors are stressing gun safety, something they say every gun owner needs to put at the top of their priority list -put them away, get a gun lock and always teach children respect for guns.\n\"That's all we want is for people to make decisions that keep children at least children in their home safe,\" Baker said.\nCopyright 2016 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
