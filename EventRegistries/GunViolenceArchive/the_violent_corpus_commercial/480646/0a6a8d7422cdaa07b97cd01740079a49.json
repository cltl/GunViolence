Mead.\nSeven people were shot, leaving one person dead, and the suspect still on the run.\nHome to a cluster of bars and restaurants, Wichita\u2019s Old Town became part of a crime scene Sunday morning.\n\u201cWe have a total of seven people that were shot,\u201d said Sgt. Scott Brunow, Wichita Police Department.\nPolice taped off the 100 block of N. Mead to investigate the overnight shooting that left a 25-year-old man dead and six others with gunshot wounds.\n\u201cAround 2 o\u2019clock I was walking home from the bars and I heard commotion,\u201d said Bryan Butler, Old Town resident. \u201cI just thought it was typical drinking activities, but never thought anything of it.\u201d\nInvestigators say the shooting happened right when Old Town bars were getting ready to close.\nOfficers directed a crowd of people when they heard at least 10 rounds of gunshots.\n\u201cThree victims were shot and they ran to Rock Island where they contacted officers,\u201d said Sgt. Bob Gulliver, Wichita Police Department. \u201cThey were transported to the hospital.\u201d\nOfficers rushed over to N. Mead to find three more victims at the scene.\n\u201cSeveral were transported by private vehicles to hospitals, three on scene,\u201d said Sgt.

Gulliver. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything different that we could have done.\u201d\nPolice did talk to several witnesses at the scene, but they have not released any details on the suspect or a motive.\nAt this time they\u2019re looking into the possibility that this may have been gang related.\nAnyone with information is asked to call 911.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
