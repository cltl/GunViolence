Both officers were taken to Sparks Hospital in Fort Smith.\nCooper was shot in the neck and underwent surgery for his injuries, but was pronounced dead at 1:15 p.m., Hollenbeck said.\nChief Spells was released from the hospital shortly after 10:30 a.m. A woman who claims to be Spells\u2019 mother said her son\u2019s head was grazed by a bullet.\nAuthorities identified the suspect as Billy Monroe Jones, 35, of Greenwood.\nDispatchers received a call around 7 a.m. that Jones had come to his father\u2019s home to take some tools and pulled a gun on his father, according to Hollenbeck.\nOfficers began arriving at the home just before 7:10 a.m. and reported Jones had a rifle pointed at law enforcement and may have been wearing some sort of ballistic vest, Hollenbeck said. Authorities were informed Jones had been due in court Wednesday morning on a petition to revoke a suspended sentence, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\nJones started shooting at officers around 7:15 a.m. and Cooper was shot around 7:40 a.m., Hollenbeck said. A few minutes later, Spells was grazed by a bullet, he said.\n\u201cImmediately when three officers got [to the house] they were basically ambushed,\u201d Sgt. Daniel Grubbs with the Fort Smith Police Department said. \u201cThe information we have received right now is it appears this guy was waiting for us to get here. It seems [he had] full intent to inflict violence against us.\u201d\nOther deputies braved gunfire to pull Cooper and Spells from the scene to bring them to EMS, so they could be taken to the hospital, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\u201cWhen the shots were fired, [the officers] were pinned down for quite a time before we could get them out and to medical attention,\u201d Grubbs said.\nA Greenwood K-9 was also believed to have been shot during the gunfire exchange with Jones, according to Greenwood Police Chief Will Dawson.\nJones also shot a police robot and disabled it. He eventually surrendered to authorities around 11:45 a.m., according to Hollenbeck. He waved a white towel out the window, walked out of the home with his hands up, and laid down on the ground to be handcuffed, authorities at the scene said. A bomb squad was also called to Jones\u2019 home because investigators heard he had a license to work with explosives.\nHighway 253 was blocked in both the north and southbound directions for several hours while the incident unfolded. About 300 personnel from multiple law enforcement agencies responded to aid in the search and then later the negotiation with Jones.\nJones was taken to the Crawford County Detention Center, authorities said.\nCurrently, Jones is facing charges of two counts of felony first-degree battery and possession of firearms by certain persons, according to the Sebastian County prosecutor\u2019s office. Formal charges have not yet been filed and more charges are likely to be added.\nJones\u2019 prior court records include:\n2007: manufacture and possession of a controlled substance, schedule IV, V\nSentenced to 60 months suspended sentence\n2011: theft of property\nSentenced to 60 months suspended sentence\nFebruary 2016: possession of firearms by certain persons, possession of a controlled substance, scheduled I and II\nFlags were lowered to half-staff at the Sebastian County Sheriff\u2019s Office in honor of Deputy Cooper and Police Chief Spells.\nCooper had been with the Sebastian County Sheriff\u2019s Office since 2001 and prior to that had been employed by the Fort Smith Police Department for five years. He was also a Marine Corps veteran.\nA Deputy Bill Cooper Memorial Fund has been set up at Farmer\u2019s Bank, and donations can be made at any branch of the bank in the area, according to a SCSO post. Cooper\u2019s family will receive 100% of the donations.\nAdditionally, there is also a donation fund for K-9 officer Kina set up in Farmer\u2019s Bank, which is under Kina Sebastian County Canine Unit.\nArkansas Gov.
