Raymond Lopez (15th).\nAn assault-style weapon was likely used and almost 30 shell casings were found at the crime scene, he said.\nThe five who were struck tried to drive away, but only made it to the parking lot of a vacant business at the southwest corner of Archer and Western, according to Lopez and Chicago Police.\nGonzalez, 18, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office. He lived less than two blocks from where he was shot in the 4200 block of South Fairfield.\nTwo men were taken in critical condition to Stroger Hospital: an 18-year-old shot in the back and a 22-year-old shot in the face, according to police and fire officials. Two more men were taken in good condition to Mount Sinai Hospital, including a 25-year-old shot in the arm and a 21-year-old shot in the finger.\nLopez addressed the media in the pouring rain with community activist Andrew Holmes, a regular presence at crime scenes across the city.\n\u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe have to get these guns off the street. We have to stop this senseless killing in our neighborhoods. We have got to come together to put an end to the retaliatory culture of conflicts on our streets.\u201d\nLopez said there has been an increase in assault-style guns recovered in his ward. Recently, he said, a \u201cmachine pistol\u201d was recovered by police.\nThe alderman chalked up the shootings to gang members looking to inflict as much damage as they can.\n\u201cThese are gang members who are on a mission to kill as many of their opposition as possible,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThere\u2019s no rhyme or reason. They\u2019re almost killing for sport, just so they can say that they killed that gang member or that gang member, for the bragging rights of saying they\u2019ve killed people.\u201d\nLopez said the targets of Wednesday\u2019s shooting were likely in the same gang as the targets in another nearby shooting last month that left two dead and two wounded about a block away at 43rd and Rockwell.\n\u201cSomeone inside of their home, I can guarantee you, knows where these weapons [are] at, what garage they\u2019re hiding them in, what abandoned car they\u2019re hiding them in,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cBefore it hits some baby or some child, that person needs to give this information up or they\u2019re going to have blood on their hands.\u201d"}
