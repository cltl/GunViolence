Raymond Lopez, 15th, said, adding that he believed gang members were \"killing for sport\" in his community.\nAll four people shot were in the same vehicle near the intersection of West 42nd Street and South Talman Avenue, officials say, with the survivors being transferred to Stroger Hospital. One was in good condition while the other three were critical. Officials said the shooting, which happened around 6 p.m. not far from Shields Elementary School, was gang related.\n\"There's no rhyme or reason\u2014they\u2019re killing for sport to say they killed that gang member or that gang member\u2014for bragging rights of saying they killed people,\u201d Lopez said.\nLopez addressed reporters as rain pelted the black umbrella he held above himself and activist Andrew Holmes. He said a group of gang members in a white van cornered some young men who were also \u201cpossibly gang members\u201d and ambushed them.\nAlderman speaking at scene of fatal shooting- says gang members in his community \"killing for sport\" @nbcchicagopic.twitter.com/ASiaQ6fHfq\n\u201cI guarantee you somebody in that car knew who was shooting at them,\u201d Holmes said.\nThe victims drove from where they were shot to the intersection of Western and Archer avenues where the car, riddled with bullets, came to a stop, officials said.\n\u201cThis is proof positive that weapons of war like assault weapons and assault rifles with cartridges this thick do not belong in our streets,\u201d he said.\nThe shootings come just days after the Chicago Police Department announced its strategy to stem the tide of shootings and murders in 2017 through a multipronged policing policy and implementing new technology. According to police, there were 762 murders, 3,550 shooting incidents and 4,331 shooting victims in 2016.\nPolice were investigating Wednesday night and no one was in custody."}
