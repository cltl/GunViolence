My little cousin Carmelo Iburquen is not dead, and has not been pronounced dead. He's right here with his family at Texas Children's Hospital fighting for his life. It would be greatly appreciated if you all spread the message that he's still hanging in there. Any and all prayers are greatly appreciated, thank you.\n#prayformelo"}
