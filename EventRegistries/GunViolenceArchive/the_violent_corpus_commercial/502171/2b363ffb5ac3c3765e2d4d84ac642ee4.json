Ledesma\u2019s home had been hit three times before.\n\u201cI just want them to stop, it\u2019s not right. They have the cops called on them before, that should get a message to them,\u201d she said.\nBut Sunday, Lanham was shooting again and this time Ledesma got hit. The teenage girl said she was hearing shots and went to tell her mother to move when a bullet rang through her home.\n\u201cThe window shattered in my face and then I thought I just got cut,\u201d she said.\nThe bullet that hit the teenager is still lodged in her hand, which was covered in a cast Monday. Her injuries require surgery, but she said she believes she saved her mom from being hit in the head.\n\u201cI stopped it from hitting my mom,\u201d Ledesma said. \u201cBroke two bones and a tendon so I can\u2019t move my finger and the bullet is still in there, so they have to take that out.\u201d\nLandham was seen walking out of jail Monday evening. His bond was set at $15,000, according to police reports.\nLedesma said she does not feel safe and is upset that a close call could have been avoided.\n\u201cIt took a 14-year-old getting shot to get them to stop,\u201d she said."}
