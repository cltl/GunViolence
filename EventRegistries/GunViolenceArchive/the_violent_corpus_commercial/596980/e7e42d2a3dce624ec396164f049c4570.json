The man has been identified as her boyfriend, 35-year-old Sherrell McNeill.\n\u201cIt is horrible for children to see their mother murdered in their presence and then for a baby to suffer a gunshot wound to the chest is just horrific,\u201d said Ronnie M. Mitchell, the attorney for the Cumberland County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nOfficials originally said the infant was critically injured in the shooting. The baby is being treated at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center and is being held in the intensive care unit.\nThe two other children, ages 7 and 8, are being cared for by deputies pending the location of next-of-kin, officials said.\nThe investigation has revealed that McNeill and Parker had been arguing prior to McNeill shooting Parker and her infant son, authorities said.\nThe McNeill was the father of the older children, but not the infant. Parker was the mother of all three.\nNeighbors told CBS North Carolina that the family lived in home for just a few months. The family was planning to move out of the home in the next couple of days and electricity had already been shut off in the house, Mitchell said.\nThe family stayed to themselves, but typically greeted other residents, neighbors said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think these people were stable because anybody with any common sense would not hurt anybody \u2014 especially a child,\u201d said neighbor Daisy Torres."}
