The 48-year-old man \u2013 who is accused of killing his ex-girlfriend, her husband and six children Saturday \u2013 said his kids \u201cwere growing up to be monsters.\u201d\nConley, who faces three counts of capital murder, spoke to local TV station KTRK on Tuesday. He said that he and former girlfriend Valerie Jackson had an on and off relationship over the course of 14 years. But when he saw how his kids were growing up, he began planning the family\u2019s murder.\n\"They were growing up to be monsters,\u201d Conley told KTRK reporter Jessica Willey. \u201cI'm not saying I killed them because of that. I'm not even saying I killed. They were growing up to be monsters.\"\nNathaniel, Conley\u2019s 13 year-old son, was one of the shooting victims. Conley said he loved his son to death, but that he didn\u2019t like the way his son or the family treated him.\n\u201cNate didn\u2019t give me any respect because of what his mother was doing to me,\u201d Conley told the local ABC affiliate. \u201cShe ignored me.\u201d\nThe TV station said he cried as he spoke about \"years of frustration\" and living as an ex-felon. The suspect would not go into details about what occurred Saturday.\nOfficials for the Department of Family Protective Services said Tuesday that the state in 2013 briefly took custody of the family's six children. But a family court judge ruled the kids should go back with their parents in Falling Oaks. DFPS officials had warned the children were in \"immediate danger,\" according to an affidavit."}
