At some point in the evening, Baker reportedly left the party with a crew of friends and later returned at Kosky\u2019s request.\nWhen Baker arrived, Kosky allegedly handed him a gun and asked for backup, according to police.\nKosky, who turned himself in later Oct. 27, reportedly told investigators with the Henry County Police Department that he shot everyone remaining in the house.\n\u201cAt one point in the interview he made the admissions, \u2018I domed everybody in the house. Two to the head. Everybody I saw. I did it,\u2019\u201d Detective David LeCroy testified during a November preliminary hearing.\nTwo witnesses hid and survived the shooting, including a woman identified as Kosky\u2019s sister. The woman called police at about 2 a.m. to report the shooting.\nWhen police arrived at the home, Bullard, Hicks and Gibson were found dead. Olinger was found shot in critical condition. She was transported to Grady Memorial Hospital, where she later died of her injuries on Oct. 30.\nThree other people were arrested Oct. 27 in connection with the crime. Jacob Williams, 18, of McDonough, 21-year-old Kayla Head of McDonough, and Brooke Knight, 19, of Locust Grove were charged with obstruction of a police investigation. The three remain under investigation in the Henry County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThe prosecution will now prepare for trial, although District Attorney Darius Pattillo said Tuesday that it is \u201chard to say\u201d when a trial date will be set. The case has not yet been assigned to a judge.\nIf convicted of murder, Kosky and Baker could face a mandatory life sentence. Pattillo said the case will be reviewed at a later date in order to determine whether his office will seek the death penalty."}
