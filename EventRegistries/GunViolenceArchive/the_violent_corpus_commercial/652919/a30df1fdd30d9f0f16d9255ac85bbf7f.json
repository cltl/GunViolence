I thought to myself, \u2018Oh, this is another guy that won't pull over for police,\u201d said Lamont Lonfair, a witness. \u201cIt's not justified to shoot a little kid or let a gun off on the highway in broad daylight. Let's think about these kids that got a future ahead of them \u2026 not take their lives from them just before it's their time.\u201d\nThe Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office is in charge of the investigation, including determining the exact location of the shooting.\nThe Sheriff's Office has not released any information about the vehicle from which the shot was fired."}
