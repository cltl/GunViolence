It was like a blink of an eye, everybody was here,\" said Lamont Lanfair, a witness.\nLanfair works across the street. He thought at first, it was a regular traffic stop.\n\"I didn't think anything tragic happened like this. So I went back into the building and helped a guest,\" Lanfair said.\nThe child was taken to Children's Hospital with what officials say are non-life threatening injuries.\nThe Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office is overseeing the investigation. Officials temporarily shut down northbound I-43 at Keefe as deputies look for the location of the actual shooting. The interstate was reopened to traffic at 7:40 p.m.\nMeanwhile, Lanfair hopes the little girl is going to be okay.\n\"It's unspeakable. Especially for a little kid, that age, to have to go through this, and for the parents to deal with this,\" Lanfair said.\nThe Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office has not said what led up to the shooting -- or if there are any suspects."}
