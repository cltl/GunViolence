(WHAS11) \u2013 A Louisville mom is now facing a Class D Felony charge after she was shot by her 2-year-old son last month.\nLMPD said on Feb. 12, Jessica Barkley's 2-year-old son gained access to her loaded 9 mm handgun that was in her nightstand. Police say the toddler removed the gun from the nightstand pointed the gun in Barkley's direction and the gun went off, striking her.\n\"She is lucky she lived, this is, we need to stop this, everybody needs to first of all we need to stop, put the guns up, we need to put the guns up, this is not the wild, wild west, everyone is trying the world into the wild, wild west and it\u2019s horrible,\" neighbor Carla Boyd said.\nBoyd lives down the street from Barkley on West Evelyn Avenue. She says this shooting is a sad reminder of the need for gun safety especially around children.\n\"I just don't understand, why are these people leaving these guns for the children to get to? A two year old come on. What are we thinking? And you know they are curious, we have toy guns, so why would you want to leave these guns available for these children to get to,\" Boyd said.\nBarkley faces a charge of wanton endangerment in the first degree.\n\"Obviously you have a second amendment right to bear arms, you have that right, but it\u2019s also a tremendous responsibility,\" LMPD Spokesperson Dwight Mitchell said.\nMitchell says incidents like this are handled on a case by case basis. Detectives consulted with the Commonwealth and County Attorney's Offices before they agreed on the wanton endangerment charge.\n\"The statute reads that it\u2019s basically where there is a disregard for human like or you create a circumstance where a human life could be taken, putting someone in danger, in this case the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and County Attorney's Office felt that it met those elements,\" Mitchell said.\n\"There have been incidents before. I'm sure the prevailing question is more than anything, why this one? And obviously everything is taken on a case by case basis obviously the county attorney, commonwealth attorney looked at it as well a judge signed off on it as well for it to go through so it met those elements of this particular charge,\" Mitchell said.\nLMPD recommends keeping firearms locked away in the home.\n\"I think it is a very good teaching moment for anybody, parents or guardians or whoever it may be that you do have a right to bear arms, but you also have again a tremendous responsibility to make sure that they are secure,\" Mitchell said.\nBarkley is expected to be arraigned on this charge March 29. Her son was removed from her custody a few days after the shooting. She is expected in family court in June."}
