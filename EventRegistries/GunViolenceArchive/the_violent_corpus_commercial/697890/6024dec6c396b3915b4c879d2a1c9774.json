Matloff said he doubts that the juvenile will be tried as an adult.\nFreeman was a quiet student who often kept to himself, said Phil Hall, principal at Fort Towson's junior high and high schools.\nHall said Freeman was not attending the school at the time of his death but that the suspect is a current student. The school district offered counseling services to students and faculty Monday.\n\"I think just because we are small and we are family and the kids know they have the support,\" Hall said, \"small schools like us rally together like a community and remind each other to love one another.\"\nClassmate Haylee Brooke said Freeman was a solitary person but that he surprised those he opened up to with his kindness and intelligence.\n\"He was wise, very wise, for his young age,\" she said.\nFort Towson is in southeastern Oklahoma between Hugo and Idabel and is near the Texas border."}
