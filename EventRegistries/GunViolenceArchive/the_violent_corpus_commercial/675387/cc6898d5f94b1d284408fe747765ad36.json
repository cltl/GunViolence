Gaines said there is no ongoing public safety threat and that investigators believe all parties involved in the shooting have been accounted for.\n\"What we\u2019re trying to figure out was why they would choose a dark wash area [for the meetup] instead of a brightly lit convenience store on the corner,\" Gaines said.\nThe pair had met up behind a QuikTrip, which Gaines said is \"a safe place to do a child custody exchange and a safe place to do an e-commerce exchange.\" She said the focus of the exchange was an electronic device.\nCheck back with azcentral.com for more details."}
