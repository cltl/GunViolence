The four-year-old\u2019s mom, Jessyca Francy, said she came home from work to find her daughter\u2019s mattress covered in blood. She took her daughter to the hospital, where she learned the bullet had missed Hayley\u2019s femoral artery by a quarter of an inch. When police arrived at the apartment to investigate, officers found a bullet hole above Hayley\u2019s bed.\nWhen asked about that night, she said a monster hurt her.\n\u201cA monster scratched me on the leg,\u201d she said.\nHayley spent two days in the hospital. After being released, she refused to return to the apartment.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to. Mom had to find a new home,\u201d Hayley said, referring to the fact that Jessyca decided to move the family out of the apartment. APD said the shot was fired from a gun in a third-floor apartment. Officers interviewed someone in that unit, but no one has been charged with a crime.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of domestic violence that comes from that house,\u201d Francy said. \u201cWhatever happened, I want the closure of knowing how this happened and for somebody to be held accountable.\u201d\nHayley has been staying with a family friend since she left the hospital. The Francy family is trying to move out of its apartment, but is finding it difficult to find a new home because of Francy\u2019s criminal history.\n\u201cI made a lot of mistakes in my past,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does make finding a place to rent hard.\u201d\nHayley is in good spirits, but has some difficulty walking. She said her favorite thing to do is run, and she\u2019s hoping to be able to do it again sometime soon.\nThe family set up a GoFundMe account to help pay for the move and replacing Hayley\u2019s mattress.
