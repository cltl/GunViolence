(Fresno police initially reported incorrectly that the boy was 12 years old.)\nThe shooting took place shortly after 1 p.m. in the 4700 block of East Montecito Avenue, near Chestnut and Ventura avenues. Capt. Anthony Martinez said the three other victims are another 16-year-old boy and two men, 28 and 48 years old. All were rushed to Community Regional Medical Center. A man who carried a dog from the home shortly after police arrived also said the dog was wounded in the chest by a bullet.\nMartinez said three of the victims were shot outside a home on the northwest corner of Montecito and Recreation Avenues and a fourth was hit by bullet which penetrated a wall. After the shooting, a 16-year-old ran from the scene and was found a block west of the incident. Martinez said he may have run because of a prior incident involving police.\nThe gunman was identified as a white male with visible tattoos who fled in a blue Chrysler four-door, possibly a Sebring. Police were searching for a motive for the shooting and did not immediately know if the violence was gang-related.\nIn July of 2016, four people were shot nearby after an early-morning party ended in violence."}
