The juvenile, who has not been identified as of 2:10 p.m. Tuesday, is an acquaintance of Loera.\n\"If it's accidental or not- we don't know at this time,\" Lt. Justin Newsome said. \"Even if it is recklessly discharging a firearm and causing the death of another person, it's still manslaughter.\"\nThe homeowners who spoke with KVUE said the officers told them that they found a suspected burglar shot dead inside the home. The homeowners were reportedly not at home when the reported burglary happened. They received a phone call from police notifying them about the incident.\nMeanwhile, one neighbor said he has seen more crime in the area recently.\n\"We're trying to improve the security at home and I mean, I don't know what else to do. I try to protect my family. That is the most important thing for me and myself as well,\" said Jorge Ramirez-Sosa.\nAnyone with information regarding the incident is asked to call the homicide tip line at 512-477-3588 or Crime Stoppers at 512-472-TIPS.
