Pazin said many of those injured had already been transported to hospitals when Sheriff's deputies arrived.\nAuthorities said the motive behind Saturday\u2019s shooting was gang-related.\n\"Was it gangs involved? Yes, it was,\" Pazin said during a news conference Sunday. \"We're not going to sugar coat it. The absolute immaturity and insensitivity over a couple of gang colors is just breathtaking.\"\nPazin said the Sheriff's Department won\u2019t release the victims' names out of respect for the families on Easter Sunday, however, they have been notified.\n\"We want to give them some time to catch up and grope for answers in this nonsensical system that we call gang violence,\" he said.\nMany of the witnesses have been uncooperative, but the major crime unit is working on piecing together what happened during the incident.\nThere are no suspects in custody at this time, Pazin said.\nThe three deaths mark the 8th homicide for Merced County this year."}
