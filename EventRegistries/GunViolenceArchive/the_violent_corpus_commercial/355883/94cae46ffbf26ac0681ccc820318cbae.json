W.L. Meeler, a homicide investigator with the Houston Police Department.\nMeeler said as many as 100 people were gathered together in the street when a vehicle pulled up nearby and someone inside fired gunshots into the crowd, wounding three men and a woman. One of the men died at the scene. The others were rushed to a nearby hospital. Their conditions were not released but police said they had non-life-threatening wounds.\nMeeler said an argument at a nightclub on along U.S. 288 near Old Spanish Trail may have led to the gunfire. Details about the confrontation were not released. Also, the victims' possible connection to the argument was not revealed. The shooting, Meeler said, could be gang-related, but he did not elaborate.\nSo far, Meeler said, investigators are having a tough time piecing together details about the shooting. Most of the people, he added, scattered and left the scene when the shots rang out. He said people in the crowd undoubtedly witnessed the shooting and he pleaded with anyone who had information about the incident to contact police.\n\"We know there were a lot of people who saw what happened,\" Meeler said. \"We just need them to come forward."}
