(6/27/16)\nEAST ORANGE - An East Orange church says that it will pay the funeral expenses for a 4-year-old boy who was shot and killed by his brother, who somehow got ahold of their mother\u2019s gun.\nThe reverend at the New Hope Baptist Church says that the church will fully pay for the funeral for 4-year-old Christopher Lassiter.\n\"The fact that the mother is in jail, a 4-year-old is dead and a 5-year-old is responsible is a tragedy, and our church wants to be there to support and help them,\u201d says the Rev. Dwight Gill.\nThe boys\u2019 mother, 22-year-old Itiyanah Spruill, is charged with endangering the welfare of a child and a weapons violation.\nOfficials say that Spruill\u2019s 5-year-old son found her loaded gun and accidentally shot his brother Saturday on Norman Street in East Orange.\nNews 12 New Jersey is told that the boys were under a grandmother\u2019s guardianship, but were often seen at Spruill\u2019s home.\nSpruill is due to appear in Essex County Court Tuesday morning. According to court records, Spruill has previously been in trouble with the law. She\u2019s previously been charged for unlawful possession of a gun.\nChristopher Lassiter\u2019s funeral is set for Friday at 10 a.m. and will be open to the public. Rev. Gill says that they are still trying to figure out if Spruill will be allowed to attend."}
