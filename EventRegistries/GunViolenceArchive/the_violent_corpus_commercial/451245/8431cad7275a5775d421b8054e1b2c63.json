(WKRN) \u2013 A Goodlettsville father has been indicted on two felonies in the accidental shooting death of his 5-year-old son.\nIt happened on Nov. 21 just before Thanksgiving after the child\u2019s big brother got a hold of the father\u2019s loaded handgun and pulled the trigger.\nThe 5-year-old boy was hit in the head and died at the family\u2019s apartment off Moss Trail.\nTheir father, 31-year-old Robert Turner, is charged with felony criminal negligent homicide and reckless endangerment.\nPolice say it was his semi-automatic handgun with a laser site that was used in the accidental shooting.\nTurner is accused of messing around with the laser, pointing it at the wall so their cat could chase it.\nHe allegedly put the gun down for 30 seconds when his 7-year-old picked it up and accidentally pulled the trigger, killing his little brother.\nNashville self-defense expert Buford Tune told News 2 that a gun is nothing to be played with, laser or no laser.\n\u201cYou have a semi-automatic, it has a light trigger, usually a 5 to 5.5-pound trigger any kid can press,\u201d Tune said.\n\u201cLeaving it laying there, I have a big problem with that,\u201d he added.\nTune says education is the key.\n\u201cYou can say, \u2018Stop! Don\u2019t touch it! Go tell an adult! Get away from it. Don\u2019t pick it up! Don\u2019t touch it; go tell someone!\u2019\u201d he explained.\nTurner is scheduled to be in Davidson County court on Jan 13. for his arraignment.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
