Prosecutors will decide on whether to file any charges.\nMatthias\u2019 family said they are devastated to have lost their \u201clittle angel,\u201d but thanked the community for their support and prayers.\nJessica\u2019s aunt Sherry said the family is doing the best they can. About 50 family members came to Payson after the shooting to offer their support.\nJessica\u2019s 3-year-old son appears to have no idea what is going on.\n\u201cIt is just an absolute travesty,\u201d Sherry said.\nJessica, who lives in the apartment complex, which her mother manages, had visited Haley regularly for at least the past two years, Sherry said.\nJessica never saw a gun there or even thought about a gun, she said.\nHaley had interacted with police regarding his weapons several times though, according to police records the Roundup received.\nIn May of 2008, a woman, who then lived in the Pinecrest Apartments, called police after Haley reportedly threatened her. The woman told officers Haley called her and told her \u201cas a licensed gun owner in Arizona he can shoot at her from 6-8 feet away if she even looks at him funny,\u201d according to a police report.\nAn officer told the woman to get a harassment injunction against Haley from the court.\nIn March of 2011, another Pinecrest tenant called police after Haley reportedly shoved her.\nThe woman suspected Haley had shot her cat with a BB gun because her cat was limping and another neighbor had reportedly seen Haley with a BB gun.\nWhen the woman asked Haley not to shoot her cat, Haley reportedly exited his apartment and shoved the woman with both hands.\nWhen police arrived and asked Haley if he had any guns, he said \u2018yes.\u2019\n\u201cAllen stated that there were (guns in the apartment) and that he was in the process of re-loading one of his weapons as he does every day,\u201d an officer said.\nHaley said he shoved the woman because he was angry she had accused him of doing something he had not done.\nPolice arrested Haley on an assault charge.\nMost recently, a woman suspected Haley was the victim.\nThe woman, another Pinecrest resident, was concerned when Haley purchased a nine-person van last year. Since Haley has no family in the area, cannot drive and has poor vision, the woman wondered why Haley had bought the van and wondered if it was elder abuse on the part of the dealership to sell him a van, according to a police report. She told officers Haley appears to have dementia.\nThe apartment manager, who said she has power of attorney for Haley, told police Haley appears to have undiagnosed Alzheimer\u2019s.\nNo charges ever came out of that case.\nHaley has not been charged in the recent shooting. Police have ruled it accidental.\nThere have been two other accidental shootings in Payson in the past three years.\nOne occurred in 2012 at the Ponderosa Campground when a bullet directed at a bear that had attacked a camper hit a woman.\nLast June, a gun shop owner inadvertently shot himself in the leg while checking out a handgun."}
