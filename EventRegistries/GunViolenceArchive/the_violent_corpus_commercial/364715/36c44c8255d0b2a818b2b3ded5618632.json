They said the people who lived here were quiet and kept to themselves.\nBut they said it\u2019s not the first time police have come to their neighborhood and it didn\u2019t really surprise them to see all the activity.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. Not that I know of anything that\u2019s happened like that here before. But the quality of individuals that live here it\u2019s not surprising,\u201d said Hise.\n\u201cI mean, unfortunately lives were lost and that\u2019s a terrible thing,\u201d said Head.\nFriends of the victims told CBS4 they did not want to speak on camera out of respect. But they stood watch for hours waiting for any news from police.\nA Greenacres police lieutenant told CBS4\u2019s Donna Rapado for now they won\u2019t be releasing any more information about what happened. The lieutenant said investigators from the Greenacres Police Department and the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office will likely continue working here through the night."}
