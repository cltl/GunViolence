Friends identified the 15-year-old as Terrance Maxwell; he died from his injuries. The 16-year-old has not been identified; he is in critical but stable condition.\nInvestigators said the victims were at a house party when they were shot. Two girls were fighting in the middle of the street when a black vehicle drove up and people inside yelled gang phrases. The people inside the vehicle began shooting into the crowd, then drove away.\n\u201cWe heard the car screeching, going back the other way,\u201d Billy Rodgers said.\nRodgers lives next door. He said the party had been going on for about two hours when it turned violent. He said a family lives at the house, but the party appeared to be all teens.\n\u201cI heard the fight,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt was two girls out here fighting and it went from a fight to gunshots.\u201d\nIn a cryptic Facebook post more than a week ago, Maxwell wrote about being shot and killed.\nNeighbor and parent Timothy White said he\u2019s troubled by the violence and even more disturbed that it centers around teens.\n\u201cThat bullet could\u2019ve went anywhere. Those bullets fly,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that we\u2019ve got our children out here killing, and it starts at home with the parents first.\u201d\nNobody has been arrested for this shooting.\nIf you have any information that could lead to an arrest, call Crime Stoppers at 901-528-CASH.\nCopyright 2017 WMC Action News 5.
