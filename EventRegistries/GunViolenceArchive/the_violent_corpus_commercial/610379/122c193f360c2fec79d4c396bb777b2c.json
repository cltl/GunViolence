Another child had been taken Saturday night to a hospital, but her injuries were not expected to be life-threatening.\nPolice declined to identify the shooter, who initial reports said had committed suicide. Police would not confirm that, saying the investigation was ongoing. The Travis County medical examiner\u2019s office is completing autopsies on the victims.\n\u201cI want to be as confident (with information) as we can be, especially with an incident that is so dynamic and so close to the community,\u201d Bastrop Assistant Police Chief James Altgelt said Sunday.\nThose who live at the complex described three of the dead as a typically happy family \u2014 a husband and wife and their young son \u2014 the father inclined toward heavy drinking, according to neighbor Sonia McQueen, but hardworking and well-liked.\n\u201cThey were always happy,\u201d neighbor Angela Myers said. \u201cNever aggressive.\u201d\nMartha Hernandez, who lives next door, called the child who died the \u201csweetest little boy.\u201d\nNino was identified by some neighbors as a baby sitter, and they said the child who was hospitalized after the shooting was her daughter.\nHernandez was home Saturday night with her 17-year-old daughter when the sound of gunfire rang throughout their apartment. They walked outside to see the bodies in the grass and called police.\n\u201cIt was all blood,\u201d Hernandez said.\nOne woman was found resting on top of a child, as if attempting to shield him from gunfire, residents said. The second child was wandering in tears amid the bodies.\n\u201cI told her to run,\u201d said Myers, who later brought the toddler to a local emergency room. \u201cShe kept saying her mom\u2019s dead, her mom\u2019s dead.\u201d\nThe incident, which began shortly after 6 p.m., occurred at the Arbors of Bastrop Apartments in the 200 block of Childers Street, in a busy commercial part of town. Residents described the area as peaceful.\nAt the time, a small group was cooling off in the pool a few yards away. Neighbors said they heard as many as eight gunshots. Officers responded within minutes, they said.\nBastrop police combed the crime scene into the wee hours of Sunday morning, as residents huddled in groups behind a line of crime scene tape. Several said they feared for their safety. However, in a briefing with reporters Saturday night, Bastrop police Detective Vicky Steffanic assured the public that no one was in any danger.\nThe Bastrop County sheriff\u2019s office and the Texas Rangers are assisting police in the investigation. Authorities would not disclose further details about what led to the gruesome deaths Saturday night.\nFor those close by, Sunday was a day of shock.\n\u201cI cried all afternoon,\u201d apartment complex resident Bill Browning said. \u201cIt was horrible.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re standing right there and looking, it\u2019s one of the most horrible things you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d"}
