Court records show Lowe is on probation after being convicted of attempted burglary in February. He\u2019s previously been convicted of drug possession, vehicle theft, battery and carrying a concealed weapon, according to court records.\nThe teen, who police are not naming because he is a minor, also is charged with perjury.\nLowe and the teen had been staying in the bedroom where Amirra found the gun, police said.\nAmirra is the second child to be killed by a gun in the last few weeks in Riviera. Three-year-old Martavious Carn was fatally shot on Aug. 14 outside Mystic Woods apartments. His mother\u2019s boyfriend, who police said was the intended target of the gunfire, also was killed.\nAnyone with information is asked to call Riviera Beach police at 561-845-4123 or Crime Stoppers of Palm Beach County at 800-458-TIPS (8477).\nOriginal story: Just weeks after a 3-year-old was shot in the city, a 4-year-old Riviera Beach girl has been killed by gunfire, police confirmed late Sunday.\nThe child was struck by a single shot inside a home around 8:30 p.m. in the 1200 block of West 32nd Street, spokeswoman Rose Anne Brown said late Sunday. She said several people were in the home, including the child\u2019s mother, and police are trying to determine who fired the shot. They also are conducting an active search of the neighborhood.\nFollowing a 911 call from the home, the child was taken by ambulance by Riviera Fire Rescue to a hospital, where she died.\n\u201cA little girl is dead. So whether it was deliberate or accidental, she\u2019s no less dead,\u201d Brown said at the scene. \u201cWe need to know who\u2019s responsible.\u201d\nShe said police questioned some of the people who were in the home, but several left immediately after the shooting.\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking members of the public that may know who was there (to come forward),\u201d Brown said.\nBrown would not immediately identify the child or the mother, and would not say whether police know what kind of gun was used.\nContact police at 561-845-4123 or Crime Stoppers of Palm Beach County at 800-458-TIPS (8477).\nA neighbor who did not want to give his name said he saw the little girl just Sunday afternoon playing in her yard.\n\u201cThey good people,\u201d the man said. \u201d I said hi to her mama.
