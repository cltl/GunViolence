It was at least the sixth such shooting of a child and at least the fourth death in Harris County this year.\nThe child, who was not immediately identified, was fatally shot about 5 p.m. Thursday at a home in the 8400 block of Tavenor Lane near Hobby Airport.\nAlso in the room at the time was an older boy, 11. He told Houston police investigators that he and the 8-year-old were tossing a pistol back and forth when it suddenly fired. The younger boy was struck in the head and died at the scene.\n\"Sometime during the day, they discovered in one of the upstairs bedrooms two unsecured firearms,\" said Robert Klementich, a Houston police homicide detective.\nRELATED: Sheriff urges gun safety after boy's death\nThe 11-year-old told police the children thought the pistol was safe because the ammunition magazine wasn't inserted into the hand grip. However, police believe one round was in the chamber of the weapon, Klementich said. \"We're going to do a forensic investigation to confirm this,\" he said.\nNeither of the boys lived at the house. The pistols they found belonged to an adult resident, police said.\nDetectives said two 12-year-old girls were downstairs at the time of the shooting.\n\"There were some adults present. The children were getting hungry so (the adults) went to a nearby store to pick up some food,\" Klementich said. \"When they returned, the adults found the juvenile was deceased.\"\nPolice said the adults and the children will be taken to the HPD headquarters for additional questioning.\n\"We're still continuing our investigation and we'll present the facts to the District Attorney's Office,\" which will determine whether charges are justified, Klementich said.\nUnder Texas law, making a firearm accessible to a child is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail.\nOver the last eight years, 14 people have been charged in Harris County for failing to secure a firearm.\nLast month, Krystal Kellermann of Katy was accused of leaving a pistol in a closet in 2014. Police said one of her children found the .40 caliber Smith & Wesson in the master bedroom. Ryan Welch, 4, was accidentally shot and killed, according to Harris County criminal records.\nKellermann was released after posting $1,000 bond."}
