An investigation found she \"had been shot in the head, but she was still alive,\" the release says. She was taken to Bartlett Regional Hospital and later flown to Anchorage.\nLt. David Campbell said the injury was not self-inflicted.\nThe townhouse and the surrounding are were secured by investigators as they looked into what happened. Police said it is unclear how many people were in the residence at the time of the shooting.\nThere was one other person at the townhouse when police arrived, and investigators believe other witnesses left before police arrived, Campbell said. Officers are now conducting interviews and obtaining search warrants, he said.\nJPD public safety manager Erann Kalwara said later Friday the investigation was continuing, but it appeared the incident was isolated and the people involved know each other.\nPolice are now seeking to contact two Juneau residents: 51-year-old Rafael Flores and 46-year-old Katherine Milton.
