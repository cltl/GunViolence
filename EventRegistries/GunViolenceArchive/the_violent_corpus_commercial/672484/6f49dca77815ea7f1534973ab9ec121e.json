Police say Christianson was not the father of the child and his sister does not know the relation between the two.\n\u201cAll I know is he\u2019s lying over there dead. That\u2019s all I know. I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know how,\u201d Johnson said.\nJohnson said she had heard Christianson was with a female, who fled the scene. Christianson was not the father of the child, but police believe the boy was the son of the woman he was with.\nChristianson had previously been involved in a gang, according to his sister. He had also recently gotten out of jail and was in a treatment program, she told Fox 9.\nRecords show Christianson had served time at the St. Cloud Correctional Facility in March 2014 for second degree assault with a dangerous weapon. He was released this past June and has been a fugitive since July 29, according to the Minnesota Department of Corrections website.\nPolice are currently interviewing witnesses to determine who was involved in the shooting.
