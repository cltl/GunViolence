Relatives identify him as 20-year-old Gustav Christianson.\nAuthorities say he was sitting in the backseat of a red vehicle next to a baby, when a burst of bullets wiped out the back window. The gunfire immediately took Christianson's life. Eight month old Jayden Redden was sitting in a car seat and was shot in the chest. He was taken to Children's Hospital, a block away, and died during surgery.\nPolice also confirmed that Children\u2019s Hospital was locked down because of an unruly crowd there.\nPolice say several people were taken in for questioning, but as of Sunday night, no one had been arrested.\n\"This is a targeted attack we do not believe this is a random incident, anyone with information needs to step forward and talk with police,\" said Officer Corey Schmidt.\nChristianson's sister says Gustav had been in a gang years ago, but after a sting in prison for an assault conviction, he was in a drug treatment program and working to straighten out his life. That goal ended with gunfire.\n\"I wish they would stop and put down the guns like my mom always said, somebody will walk out the door and you never know if they're gonna walk back in.\""}
