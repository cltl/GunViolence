He is suspected of firing the shots that killed 7-month-old Jayden Eric Redden and 20-year-old Gustav Duane Christianson II. The two victims were found in the back seat of a vehicle Sunday by officers responding to a shots fired call at 11th Avenue South and 26th Street East.\nJulia Johnson told KARE 11 that Christianson was recently released from prison, was formerly affiliated with the Native Mob gang and was in a treatment program. On Sunday police said they believe Christianson was the intended target of the shooter.\nThe Hennepin County Attorney's Office is seeking an extension until later Thursday for making a charging decision. The county attorney\u2019s office believes that if charges are brought, it is \"highly likely\" it will be in adult court."}
