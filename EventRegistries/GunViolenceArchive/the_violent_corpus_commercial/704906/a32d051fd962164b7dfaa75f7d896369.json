The victim was found on the 300 block of Pioneer Road.\n(Updated 3:25 p.m.) WATSONVILLE >> A 15-year-old boy is dead after an officer-involved shooting early Saturday morning on the 800 block of Amesti Road, outside Watsonville.\nIt is the second deadly shooting by law enforcement in Santa Cruz County in 34 days.\nSanta Cruz County Undersheriff Jeremy Verinsky said at 2:53 a.m., two people were stabbed in the rural neighborhood of Amesti and Pioneer roads. He declined to say what the motive was or if any of the three were related.\nThe victims were found inside a six-bedroom house on the 800 block of Amesti. One suffered critical injuries. Another suffered serious injuries. Both were taken to trauma centers, via air ambulance. One of the victims was described by paramedics as a 60-year-old man. Both are expected to survive.\nThe suspected stabber was at the scene when deputies arrived. He climbed on top of a fire truck where deputies talked to him briefly before he fled the scene, according to law enforcement.\nVerinsky said within 10 minutes deputies, officers from various police agencies found the teen not far from the scene, on the 300 block of Pioneer Road, still armed with the knife.\n\u201cEfforts were made to engage with the suspect to diffuse the situation and various less-lethal weapons were tried,\u201d Verinsky said. \u201cWhen the suspect advanced on deputies with his knife, he was shot at least once.\u201d\nBy 3:16 a.m., deputies called for a third ambulance for a victim of a gunshot.\nParamedics, who were standing by, treated the suspect, but he died at the scene, Verinsky said.\nThe teen was found with a silver pocket knife.\nSheriff Jim Hart said they tried to subdue the teen with Tasers, more than one weighted foam round and other means of subduing the suspect before a deputy fired one lethal round.\n\u201cThese cases are very upsetting,\u201d Hart said.\nHart said he did not know if the stabbing was gang-related and could not release the name of the shooting victim because he had not been able to notify the family.\nHart said an unidentified number of deputies are on paid leave after the shooting but declined to provide further information. He said there is body camera footage from the deputies and he will provide that at some point. In the meantime, Hart said he had turned the case over to the Santa Cruz County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\u201cThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff\u2019s Office never wants to use deadly force of any kind, but on 11/19/2016 shortly before 3 a.m., a deputy fired his service weapon to protect himself and the community,\u201d Verinsky said.\nAdvertisement\nThe area of the incident is a quiet, rural neighborhood filled with a mix of homes, some in the million-dollar range. It\u2019s located near the popular Four Corners area of Corralitos.\nNeighbors said three men rented the split-level home, all working in construction and are \u201cquiet neighbors.\u201d There were two pickups from Knox Roofing in the driveway.\nOne of the neighbors had dined with the men and called them \u201crespectable.\u201d\nThe men who lived in the house have kids in the area, but the kids don\u2019t live at the house, neighbors said. None of the neighbors heard anything early Saturday morning.\nTim Crandall, a local pastor at a nearby church, said he did not know the men. He said he didn\u2019t hear any gunshots but was roused when his dogs barked.\nNeighbors said, \u201cThis is a quiet, peaceful place. Things like this don\u2019t happen around here.\u201d\nNeighbors said they had more questions than answers about what happened.\nThe family who lives at the house on the 300 block of Pioneer Road where the man was shot and killed, said she was asleep when they heard a man run through the front door of their one-story house. He ran through the house and out a side door facing Pioneer Road.\n\u201cThe man entered my house about 3:05 to 3:08 a.m. I heard his steps,\u201d she said.\nThe woman who lives at the house said she did not see the man and in fear gathered her family, her three young children and her husband, in the back bedroom.\nThe woman, who spoke Spanish and asked not to be identified, said she thought she heard the police yelling \u201cLook nice.\u201d She then heard the man saying, \u201cOK. OK. OK.\u201d\nShe heard three gunshots next. The first two weren\u2019t loud, she said. \u201cThe third was very loud.\u201d\nAfter talking to authorities, she saw the man dead in the grass between her fence and Pioneer Road. She said law enforcement stayed at the scene for about 30 minutes and returned later that morning.\nAnother neighbor on Pioneer Road said he woke up when he heard sirens.\n\u201cIt happens. It just happened here,\u201d he said of the normally quiet farming neighborhood.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies remained at the scene Saturday afternoon. Just before 1 p.m., Santa Cruz County sheriff\u2019s office forensics vans left the area.\nThe shooting marks the sixth homicide in the county this year. Five have occurred in Santa Cruz. One in the unincorporated area of the county.\nIn July of 2015, sheriff\u2019s deputies shot and killed a Boulder Creek on teenager after they said pointed a loaded rifle at them. Deputies were cleared of any wrongdoing in the killing of Cyrus Hurtado.\nSANTA CRUZ COUNTY HOMICIDES 2016\nJan. 5: Howard Atkinson shot to death his sister-in-law, 22-year-old Cherish Villapia of Iowa, in his apartment on the 100 block of Chestnut Street in Santa Cruz, police said.
