The boy's mother was home and discovered her injured son and called authorities. The child was transported by LifeFlight to Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center and was pronounced dead at about 8:20 p.m.\nGilliland said five people have been detained for questioning. Two adult males and three juvenile males who apparently were in the next apartment were detained, authorities said.\n\"We're trying to get to the bottom of what happened and how the gun came into play,\" Gilliland said.\nHe also said the 6-year-old had a 3-year-old sibling.\nGilliland mentioned that this incident comes on the heels of recent fatalities of children who died playing with firearms. In the latest case, however, the child was doing nothing more than walking from one room to the other, Gilliland noted.\nEarlier this month, an East Harris County boy was accidentally shot by his younger brother as the two were handling a gun in their home, officials said.\nRELATED: Harris sheriff pleads for gun safety\nDays before that, a 3-year-old died after a shooting in northwest Harris County.
