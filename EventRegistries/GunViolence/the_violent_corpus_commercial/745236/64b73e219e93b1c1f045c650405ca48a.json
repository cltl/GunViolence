I started (CPR) on the one, but I noticed blood was coming out of his mouth, so I turned his head to the side.\"\nAnother woman, Anderson said, joined her in performing CPR on the young men until officials arrived. According to Anderson, it appeared one brother had been shot in his left kidney and the other in the head.\nAnderson said she saw three men run out of a house on Churchill Ave.\nPolice were called to the scene at around 4:30 p.m., where they roped off the block, looking for the shooter and used a K-9 unit to investigate.\nPolice said the suspected shooter was found and detained."}
