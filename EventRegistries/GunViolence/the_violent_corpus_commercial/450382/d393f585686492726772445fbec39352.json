Bryan Taylor, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s office said Friday.\nSheriff\u2019s investigators believe the 2-year-old\u2019s gunshot wound was self-inflicted, Taylor said. The parents were in the home, but it was unknown if they were in the room at the time of the shooting. The child was taken to University Medical Center, where they remained Friday.\nIt was not immediately clear if charges will be filed in the case.\nEvidence will be turned over to the Lubbock County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office, Taylor said, which will decide if criminal charges will be filed.\nThe incident occurred around 5 p.m. and deputies remained on the scene for an hour.\nTexas Child Protective Services is investigating the case.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office also is continuing its investigation.\njordan.sigler@lubbockonline.com\n\u2022 766-8742"}
