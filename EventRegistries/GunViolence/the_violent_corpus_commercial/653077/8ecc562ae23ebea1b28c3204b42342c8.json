Reports still differ as to whether five or six people had been shot, according to an update at 9:40 p.m. by New Orleans Police Department spokeswoman Dawne Massey.\nInitial reports indicated a triple shooting in the area of First and South Derbigny streets, with police issuing an alert about the shooting at about 8:30 p.m. Police have not released information about the conditions of the victims.\nPolice placed dozens of evidence markers at the intersection of South Claiborne Avenue and First Street, where shell casings lay scattered outside a convenience store called South Claiborne Market. Witnesses standing in the neutral ground along South Claiborne said they heard around 20 shots.\nOne man, who asked not to be identified, said he saw the shooter park a truck near the market, exit the vehicle and \"peek around the corner to see if he was there.\" The man said the shooter then opened fire at someone who was halfway down the block near an apartment complex.\nThe man said bystanders were also struck, including one person in a wheelchair. The shooter fled in the truck, he said.\nThe block where the apartment complex sits was the scene of at least one other shooting, when two men were shot in April 2015."}
