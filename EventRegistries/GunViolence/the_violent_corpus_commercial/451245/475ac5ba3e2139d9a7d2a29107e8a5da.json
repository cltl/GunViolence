That's when the sibling allegedly picked up the gun to play with the cat.\nHe was not familiar with how the laser worked, and he pulled the trigger, firing the round that hit his brother, according to police.\nPolice said they do not expect any charges to be fired against the sibling. The Davidson County District Attorney\u2019s Office is reviewing the case to see if charges will be filed against the children's father.\nCopyright 2015 WSMV (Meredith Corporation).
