Officers later determined that the wound was self-inflicted.\nWhile they were handling that incident, officers received another call about a car burglary at a home in the 3300 block of Rock Creek Run, about a block from the shooting scene.\nThe affidavit stated that the car owner reported that, among other things, the thief had taken two handguns from his vehicle.\nInvestigators spoke with a friend of Hernandez who told them that Hernandez had broken into that car and stolen the weapons, the affidavit stated. The friend said that Hernandez shot himself while \"messing around\" with one of the guns in his home, the affidavit stated.\nPolice obtained a warrant for Hernandez's arrest in January and took him into custody Tuesday. He is charged with two counts of theft of a firearm.\nCopyright 2016 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}
