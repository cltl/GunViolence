Both were listed in critical condition at University Hospital.\nAbout 20 minutes after the violence, Freeman allegedly went to a Raceland home and shot Milton Bourgeois, the CEO of Ochsner St. Anne General Hospital.\nParish Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Brennan Matherne said in a statement that Bourgeois was fatally shot. His wife, Ann Bourgeois, was also hit, but she survived, Matherne said.\nPolice soon identified Freeman as the shooter and swarmed his Houma home, where they found his wife \u2014 Denise Freeman \u2014 dead in a bathtub. Her cause of death was not immediately released.\nThe couple had a history of domestic violence, and courts had issued at least two protective orders, the most recent expiring last month, WDSU reported.\nThe news station also reported that Ben Freeman was ordered to have supervised visits with his children.\nFreeman \u2014 who had worked at three area hospitals over the last few years, including the facility operated by Bourgeois \u2014 was found dead in a vehicle pulled over along U.S. Highway 90 near Bayou Blue, police said.\nHe apparently died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nPolice said a shotgun was used in all of the shootings.\nWith News Wire Services"}
