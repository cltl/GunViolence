The revolver had been left on a nightstand and didn't have a trigger lock, investigators said.\nPolice said the gun went off and the bullet hit the 13-year-old visitor in the chest. It's unclear who was handling the gun when it went off.\nPolice said they believe the shooting is a result of a gun owner failing to properly secure her weapon in the home while she went to work as a postal worker.\nThe grandmother has been taken into custody. Her three grandsons are being interviewed by police.\nAuthorities performed CPR on the victim at the scene, but he was pronounced dead at Henry Ford Hospital.\nIf not for the heavy snowfall, the boys would have been in school, but class was canceled for Monday due to the winter storm.\nTwo of the boys live in the home with their grandmother, police said.\nStay with ClickOnDetroit.com for updates.\nSign up for ClickOnDetroit Email Newsletters (click here) for more stories like this.\nCopyright 2016 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved."}
