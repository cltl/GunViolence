A gunman opened fire inside about 7 p.m. September 23 at a Macy\u2019s store at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington, police say.\nCetin, 20, is a native of Turkey but is now a legal resident of the United States.\nThe gunman fled the scene before police arrived and remained at large for 24 hours after the shooting.\nThe fatal victims have been described as four females \u2014 ranking in ages from 16 to 95 \u2014 and one male.\nCetin was arrested without incident nearly 24 hours after the shooting in Oak Harbor, Washington, about 30 miles from Burlington.\nHere\u2019s what we know so far:\n1. Cetin Was \u2018Zombie Like\u2019 When He Was Arrested\nLt. Chris Cammock of the Oak Harbor Police Department said at a press conference announcing Cetin\u2019s arrest that the suspect was \u201ckind of zombie-like\u201d when he was taken into custody. He didn\u2019t attempt to run from arresting officers. Officials had received numerous tips about the suspect. Lt. Michael Hawley of the Island County Sheriff\u2019s Office added that shortly after he received a report that Cetin was close, Hawley found the suspect walking on the street.\nKIRO\u2019s Gary Horcher reported during the search that someone identifying himself as the shooter has contacted police. The shooting began just after 7 p.m. inside one of the Macy\u2019s stores in the mall, reports KOMO. A witness to the attack, Tari Caswell, told the Skagit Valley Herald about her experience during the incident saying, \u201cI just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it just didn\u2019t feel right. And it got very quiet. And then I heard a lady yelling for help, and a man came and got me and another lady, and we ran out of the store.\u201d\nThe female victims were shot dead at Macy\u2019s make-up desk. Authorities say that the suspect checked out the area before going back out to get a gun. KING 5\u2019s Chris Ingalls reports that the weapon is thought to have been a .22 caliber hunting rifle. KING 5 reports that cops believe Cetin stole the guns he used from his father. That gun was recovered at the scene. Due to a prior arrest, Cetin had been prohibited from owning guns.\n2. The Gunman Allegedly Called Out a Woman\u2019s Name Before Opening Fire\nWashington State Patrol Sgt. Mark Francis told the media that he couldn\u2019t comment on reports that the gunman had called out a woman\u2019s name before opening fire, according to Q13 Fox. The gunman was armed with what appeared to be a hunting rifle. KING 5 reports that Cetin\u2019s ex-girlfriend previously worked at the mall.\nAt a press conference, Mount Vernon police Lt. Chris Cammock said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what his motivations were. I don\u2019t know what his motivations were to do this. I don\u2019t know what his motivations were to continue. I don\u2019t know what his motivations were to stop.\u201d\nOfficials declined to release a motive for the attack. Cammock added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to rule out anything at this point.\u201d There is no apparent connection between Cetin and the victims of the shooting. Cetin appeared in court on September 26 and was charged with five counts of murder in the first degree. Bail was requested at $2 million.\n3. He Was Arrested on an Assault Charge in July 2015\nOnline records show that Cetin was arrested in July 2015 on charges of assault in the fourth degree. KIRO reports that as a result of the charges, Cetin was ordered to undergo mental health counselling that he completed in March 2016. During which time, he was ordered not to take drugs or drink alcohol. As of August 25, 2016, Cetin was found in compliance with the court order.\nThe New York Daily News reports that the victim in the assault was Cetin\u2019s stepfather. That man said at the time that the suspect was \u201cgoing through a hard time.\u201d The newspaper adds that Cetin also had an arrest for drunk driving.\nInitial descriptions had described Cetin as being Hispanic. According to his Facebook page, Cetin is a native of Adana in Turkey. He\u2019s a graduate of Oak Harbor High School, class of 2015. Cetin describes his nickname as \u201cThe Turk.\u201d As of 2014, he was in a relationship. While in high school, Cetin was in ROTC.\nA classmate of Cetin\u2019s from Oak Harbor High School, Uhlaine Finnigan, told the New York Times that the suspect was \u201csuspect.\u201d She added that he would \u201ctouch girls on their buttocks\u201d by \u201ceither slapping or grabbing them.\u201d Finnigan also said that:\nHe did that to girls of all grades at the high school including my best friend and I, regardless of the blatant disgust from the girls and being told to stop.\nA 2011 posting on his Facebook page from a friend referred to the suspect as \u201creally annoying\u201d and \u201csometimes really nasty,\u201d though the friend also called Cetin as \u201cfunny.\u201d\nWhile in 2012, another friend wrote, \u201cTruth is: You are a very odd character. You were always going on about being Russian and stuff like that, but under that you really supported America (or so it seemed to me) and I always thought that was really cool.\u201d\nCetin is an active Call of Duty player, even posting videos of himself playing the game to his YouTube channel.\n4. He Thinks That Governor Jay Inslee & President Obama\u2019s Liberalism \u2018Sounds Like Communism\u2019\nIn response to a letter in the Whidbey News-Times in May 2013 praising President Obama and Washington Governor Jay Inslee, Cetin commented that the pair\u2019s liberalism \u201csounds like Communism.\u201d On his Twitter page, which hasn\u2019t been updated since the summer of 2015, Cetin recommended Hillary Clinton and \u201cHitler\u2019s wife\u201d to be the new face of the ten dollar bill.\nA tweet of Cetin\u2019s from January 2015 led some on social media to believe he was a supporter of Hillary Clinton\u2019s. The message read, \u201cWe win I vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201d Online records show no party affiliation in his voting history.\n5. One of the Victims Has Been Named as a 16-Year-Old Cancer Survivor; Another, a 95-Year-Old Woman\nThe Seattle Times reports that one of the victims has been named as 16-year-old cancer survivor Sarai Lara. She was a student at Mount Vernon High School. KIRO reports that she was with her father at the mall. He was outside smoking when the gunfire erupted, according to the station. Her classmates have hatched a plan to wear purple and pink in her honor on Monday, September 26. While Lara\u2019s mother, told the Seattle Times, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair what happened to her.\u201d\nAnother of the victims has preliminarily been named as 52-year-old Shayla Martin who worked at the makeup desk in the Macy\u2019s store. Her sister, Karen Van Horn, told the Seattle Times, \u201cWe\u2019re having a really hard time.\u201d Van Horn is an employee of The Herald newspaper in Everett, Washington. Van Horn told that newspaper that a witness had confirmed to the family that Martin had been killed. Van Horn said, \u201cShe was so sweet. She was just very independent. She wanted to make her own way. She didn\u2019t want to rely on anyone else.\u201d\nKIRO reports that two of the other victims are Belinda Glade, a probation officer, and her 95-year-old mother Beatrice Dotson. The Mayor of Burlington, Steve Sexton, referred to those lost as \u201ctreasured members\u201d of the community.\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, this is the sixth mass shooting \u2014 meaning an incident with at least four victims \u2014 in 2016 in Washington. The last was in July 2016 when Allen Ivanov was accused of shooting three people dead at a college party in the town of Mukilteo."}
