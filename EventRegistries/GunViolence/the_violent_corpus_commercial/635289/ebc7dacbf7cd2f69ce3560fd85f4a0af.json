Michael Harrison and State Police Supt.

The suspect was shot and killed at the scene.\nEdmonson and Harrison said that a search continued for two other suspects with officers going door-to-door Sunday night.\nAccording to Edmonson, State Police have been concentrating on auto thefts during their time in the city. He said there have been more than 300 during the past 18 months.\n\"These stops (for stolen vehicles) are important to us, because we've found drugs, we've found weapons,\" said Edmonson.\n(\u00a9 2017 WWL)"}
