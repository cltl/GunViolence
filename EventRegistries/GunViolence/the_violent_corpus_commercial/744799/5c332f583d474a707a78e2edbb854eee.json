Officers found a black man, 23, fatally shot in the 70 block of Pepper Street.\nMinutes later, paramedics from Pasadena Fire Station 36 reported that they were treating a black woman, 38, for a gunshot wound. She was taken to a hospital in critical condition.\nJust after the shooting, a single-vehicle crash occurred at the intersection of California Boulevard and St. John Avenue, the police report said. Two more gunshot victims were found with the car: a black man, 23, who was fatally wounded; and another black man who was hospitalized with wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening.\nPolice Lt.
