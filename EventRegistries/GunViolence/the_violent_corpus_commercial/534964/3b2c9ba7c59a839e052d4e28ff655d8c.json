The girl was taken to Lee Memorial Hospital, then transferred to Health Park Hospital.\n\u201cJust a lot of cops, they had the whole block streamed up back there,\u201d said neighbor Daniel Scott. \u201cA little kid shot accidentally or unaccidentally is unacceptable.\u201d\nThe 4-year-old\u2019s condition was not immediately known.\nThis is the second time in less than two months that Lee County deputies have been called to the home. In February, two men stormed into the home and opened fire. One bullet pierced the wall of the 4-year-old\u2019s bedroom.\nNeighbors say Valle may have purchased a gun after the incident.\n\u201cHe probably got that for protection. I don\u2019t know of him ever having one before,\u201d Scott added.\nAs of Tuesday, Valle has not been charged in connection with the incident."}
