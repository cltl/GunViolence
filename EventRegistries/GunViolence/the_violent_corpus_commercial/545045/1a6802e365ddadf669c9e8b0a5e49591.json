Guerrero told them she was getting out of her car when she heard several shots, and as she began walking toward her home, she realized she had been shot in the right thigh.\n\"They can't be shooting people like that,\" she said in Spanish. \"They could have killed someone. I could have been killed. They could have killed me.\"\nWitnesses told police that two people fled the area on bicycles after the incident.\n\"I don't know who fired the shots,\" she said. \"I know there were three (people), but I only saw two when the shots were fired.\"\nA short time later, police saw a teen on a bike matching the witnesses' description. A 16-year-old city resident was arrested near Oak Street and Myrtle Avenue.\nThe alleged gunman, a 17-year-old Clifton resident, was later arrested at his home.\n\"Teenagers,\" she said. \"Where are their parents?
