McBain.\nThe prosecutor's office has previously said police found four guns in Spitler's possession immediately following the shooting death of his brother, 21-year-old Patrick Spitler in December.\nBlackman-Leoni Public Safety Detective Sgt. Chris Boulter testified during a preliminary examination for Riley Spitler the teen and his older brother often fought about the younger Spitler's lifestyle.\nPolice said Riley Spitler told them he thought the gun was unloaded when he walked into his brother's room, said something to the effect of \"Do you feel lucky\" and pulled the trigger.\nPatrick Spitler was pronounced dead at the scene in the 5000 block of Big Rock Street in Blackman Township on Dec. 6.\nOpen murder allows a judge or jury to decide if first- or second-degree murder or manslaughter, if any charge, is appropriate. Both first-degree and second-degree murder carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.\nThe penalty for felony firearm is two years in prison and a charge of possession with intent to deliver marijuana carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison, according to the prosecutor's office.\nRiley Spitler has been charged as an adult in the case and has been held at the Jackson County Youth Center since his arrest."}
