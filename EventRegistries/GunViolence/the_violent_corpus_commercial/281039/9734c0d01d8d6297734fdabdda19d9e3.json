Five other people were wounded.\nThe three were known gang members who saw rival gang members and shot at them in a crowd around 10 p.m. Jan. 19, 2015, at North New Braunfels Avenue and Gibbs, police said. The incident occurred just hours after the city\u2019s annual MLK Day march and celebration, which was held nearby.\nVideo surveillance footage of the shooting helped police identify the men, who used an AK-47-style assault rifle, a .40-caliber handgun and a .380-caliber handgun.\nAccording to court documents, Joseph told investigators that he only shot once into the air after Howard pointed out their targets, told him to park, waited a few minutes and led the trio around a fence to begin shooting.\nCourt records indicate Howard told a detective he fired four or five shots at Price and Willrich because they were the first two people he saw and that he fired in self-defense.\nAfter entering a plea, Howard was sentenced last week to 45 years. Joseph, who reached a plea agreement in July, was sentenced Friday to 25 years, according to court records.\nAll three men pleaded to two counts of murder. They will have to serve at least half of their sentences before they are eligible for parole.\nezavala@express-news.net\nTwitter: @elizabeth2863"}
