The other is now recovering at an area hospital.\nIt happened around 8 p.m. Tuesday night on Majestic Street.\nJose, who asked us not to use his last name, said the teenagers had been walking up and down the street for about 10 minutes.\nAccording to Jose, he and his dad were hanging out in their backyard when the teens walked up their driveway.\n\u201cThe first teenager pulls out his firearm and points it directly at us,\u201d Jose recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t let him finish talking. My first reaction was to take out my gun and open fire.\u201d\nJose said the teens appeared to be about 15 or 16 years old.\nJose told KHOU 11 News he had never seen the underage suspects before the encounter. He said he wasn\u2019t sure why they picked his family\u2019s house.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to die, but oh well. He asked for it,\u201d Jose said.\nJose said he got his concealed handgun license four months ago to protect himself and his family.\nHe believes things would have ended much differently if he hadn\u2019t been armed.\n\u201cI had no other choice. It would be me or my dad laying down on the ground dead. I had to do what I had to do to protect myself,\u201d he said.\nJose said he called 911 right after unleashing seven shots toward the suspects.\nHouston Police said the surviving teen ran home after getting shot. He\u2019s now recovering in the hospital and is expected to be OK.\nNeither teenage suspect has been identified by authorities.\nA neighbor said the teens attend Wheatley High School, but Houston Independent School District could not confirm that.\nPeople in the east Houston community are applauding the actions of Jose. They hope it sends a stern message to others who are thinking about committing crimes.\n\u201cIf anybody is thinking twice about coming over here to rob somebody, that\u2019s what is going to happen,\u201d said neighbor Paul Garay. \u201cI don\u2019t wish death on nobody, but if you do wrong, karma\u2019s a mother.\u201d\nNo charges have been filed at this time. This case will now be headed to a grand jury.\n(\u00a9 2017 KHOU)"}
