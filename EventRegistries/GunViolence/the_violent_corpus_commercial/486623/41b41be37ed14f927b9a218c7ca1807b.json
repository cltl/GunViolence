Arresting officers recovered the pills and a six-shot revolver handgun.\nTerry Wolfe, who is the mayor of Bean Station - a town of under 3,000 - said that Holt worked for the local police department from 2002 to 2004.\n'He subsequently quit our department and went to the Grainger County Sheriff\u2019s Department, where he was a short-lived officer there, also,' Wolfe said, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel.\nLocal resident Brad Milton, who has known Holt for several years, told the local station WATE that he is not surprised by what happened Thursday.\n'He was running around on drugs,' Milton said. 'If he did that, he deserves to be put under the jail, if you ask me.'\nHowever, Holt's neighbor of more than a decade, Anita Hayes, said the 37-year-old was very professional while he was on the force.\nThings started changing a few years ago when Hayes said Holt had gone on some kind of medication. Then recently, her once friendly and quiet neighbor turned unstable.\nDerek Green, a nephew of the slain pharmacy owner Stephen Lovell, was working at the supermarket next door to the drug store at around 11am when he was told that a shooting took place inside his uncle's business.\nAccording to the relative, Lovell was not the kind of person to resist a robbery.\nGreen told the TV station WBIR that the married father of three had just celebrated his 42nd birthday last week.\nHe had purchased the pharmacy just over a year ago, and according to his nephew, he was excited to see his small business grow.\n\u2018He was just easy to talk to, always there, never seen him unhappy. Always playing with his kids,\u2019 said Green."}
