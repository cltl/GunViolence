There are different witnesses, different alleged victims, all the evidence is going to be different.\"\nDistrict Attorney Jack Daneri said, \"We don't think it is going to be difficult for a jury to separate out Mr. Eady's actions as we have alleged them versus the other four in the vehicle. So for that reason we did not believe a severance was appropriate.\"\nOther defense motions now being considered by Judge Rusty Cunningham, include a request to drop all charges, arguing sufficient evidence was not presented during the preliminary hearing.\nAnd some of the lawyers are asking for the criminal and juvenile records of potential witnesses who may testify against their clients.\nNow as far as moving the trial to another county, or having an outside jury travel to Erie to hear the case, Judge Cunningham said jury selection will start in Erie with potential jurors questioned individually.\nHe said if that does not work out, he will consider using an outside jury.\nIt is not clear when Judge Cunningham will rule on the pre-trial motions.\nA trial date has not yet been scheduled."}
