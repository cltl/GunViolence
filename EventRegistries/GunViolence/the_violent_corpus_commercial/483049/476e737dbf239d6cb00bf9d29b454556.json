(WHTM) \u2013 When someone is involuntarily committed for mental health issues, the facility where they are committed must notify the county. The county is then required to notify state police so they can put the information into their background check system, preventing that person from purchasing firearms.\nThat did not happen with Don Meyer Jr., the man charged in the death of his 12-year-old daughter Ciara, ABC27 News has learned.\nMeyer allegedly pointed a rifle at a constable serving an eviction notice at the family\u2019s home near Duncannon last month. The constable fired one shot that went through Meyer\u2019s arm and into Ciara\u2019s chest, killing her. Police said Meyer should not have owned guns because he was involuntarily committed to a mental health institution.\nABC27 News obtained a gun application Meyer filled out in 2012, the year after he had been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility in Dauphin County. Last week, we asked state police why the application was not flagged. They said they were never notified by the county that Meyer was involuntarily committed.\nABC27 filed a right-to-know request with Dauphin County, asking for any documents that would show the county had notified state police about Meyer\u2019s involuntary commitment in 2011. In an email, the county open records officer said the county is prohibited by law from commenting on specific mental health-related cases.\n\u201cFollowing the media reports of this incident, the county conducted a quality assurance review and determined that all proper procedures were followed,\u201d said Scott Burford, Dauphin County\u2019s open records officer.\nWe showed this response to Pennsylvania State Police.\n\u201cWe have no record of having received a notification, either in our database or paper archives of this particular Act 77 notification form,\u201d said Trooper Adam Reed, a state police spokesman.\nThe gun Meyer purchased in 2012 was not recovered when police conducted a search warrant at this home after his daughter\u2019s death, but they did recover five other weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Four years after he had been committed, Meyer still had weapons.\nMichael Giaramita, a Harrisburg-based attorney who deals with gun laws, says under the law Meyer should not have had any weapons in his home.\n\u201cUnder Pennsylvania law, those who have been committed under the Mental Health Procedures Act have 60 days to get rid of those firearms,\u201d Giaramita said.\nIn this case, State Police say they did not know Meyer had been committed, but if they had, would they have been required to go to his home and remove any guns?\n\u201cI am unaware of any law that requires them to go to the person and remove the firearms from the home,\u201d Giaramita said.\nAn issue that can be added to the mental health/gun debate.\n\u201cThere is a need to enforce the existing laws, and until they begin enforcing the existing laws, we are wasting our time searching for a broader solution,\u201d Giaramita said.\nIn 2011, involuntary mental health commitment notifications were done by fax or mail. Dauphin County is now using an online option that allows them to enter the information directly into the State Police database.\nGet breaking news, weather and traffic on the go.
