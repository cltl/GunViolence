He received some treatment at ARMC before being transferred to Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston in Decatur, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. A call to an ARMC official seeking any information available on the boy\u2019s treatment was not returned as of late Saturday evening.\nThe initial report from the sheriff\u2019s office indicated that the boy\u2019s wound, located high on his upper right shoulder, was not a life-threatening injury, and that he was alert and able to respond to officials investigating the incident.\nNo foul play is suspected, according to the Oconee County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources was notified of the incident by local authorities and is conducting it own investigation, a post on the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s Facebook page indicated late Saturday morning.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office is not identifying the teen due to his age, except to say that he is an Oconee County resident. The DNR may be issuing a news release on its investigation at a later time, according to the Oconee sheriff\u2019s office. Efforts to contact the DNR\u2019s regional law-enforcement office late Saturday afternoon were unsuccessful."}
