Holmes said an arrest warrant was obtained for Godfrey on a count of second-degree murder and a count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon after witnesses identified him as one of the shooters in the Sunday morning event.\nGodfrey was arrested around 1 a.m. Monday and booked into Ouachita Correctional Center with a bond of $650,000.\nHolmes previously said officers were dispatched to the Civic Center parking lot shortly after 1:30 a.m. Sunday regarding a fight that had broken out as patrons were leaving a private event attended by as many as 2,000 people.\nAn initial investigation suggested that two groups with a previously existing conflict stated fighting in the parking lot after the event. As officers were responding, gunshots were fired, and five people were hit.\nTwo victims died, and three were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. The names of the deceased are being withheld pending notification of next-of-kin.\nThe party was a BYOB event, according to reports, but Holmes said further investigation, including autopsy reports, would be required to determine if the victims had consumed alcohol before the shooting.\nHolmes said an update on this case will be provided Tuesday.\nFollow Bonnie Bolden on Twitter @Bonnie_Bolden_ and on Facebook at http://on.fb.me/1RtsEEP."}
