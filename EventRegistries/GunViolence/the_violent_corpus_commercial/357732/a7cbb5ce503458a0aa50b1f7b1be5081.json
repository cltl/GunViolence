Montgomery, who was arrested without incident, has been charged with felony murder and malice murder, four counts of aggravated assault and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in connection with the death of Wali Clanton Jr., 19, of Stockbriddge.\nClanton was one of five people wounded after an argument broke out near midnight Saturday at the end of a pool party that attracted more than 400 people, many drawn by social media announcements. The party was at a home in the 600 block of Highway 279 in north Fayette County. The other four received non-life threatening injuries.\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident we have the person who shot Wali Clanton,\u201d Allen Stevens, executive assistant to Fayette Sheriff Barry Babb, said Friday.\u201dOur investigators have been working around the clock since the shooting. Our investigation pointed to the person who was arrested. We wanted to bring some closure especially to the family who lost their son.\u201d\nWhen asked if more arrests were imminent, Stevens said \u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019ll be any others but the sheriff did state the investigation is continuing.\u201d\nStevens said he did not know the details of Montgomery\u2019s prior felony charges.\nClanton\u2019s family learned of the arrest shortly before 4 p.m. Friday. One relative said it\u2019s not likely Clanton and Montgomery knew each other.\n\u201cIt\u2019s mixed emotions,\u201d said Clanton\u2019s aunt Anita Robinson who lives in Lawrenceville. \u201cEven though my heart feels less heavy, this (arrest) feels like a gut punch. I don\u2019t find comfort in someone else\u2019s loss. The process of justice is started. I don\u2019t rejoice in that. I know for us as a people, two of our boys are now gone. We\u2019ll leave it in God\u2019s hands.\u201d"}
