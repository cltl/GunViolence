Sandy police say a customer wanted to check out a Colt 45 from a dealer. He took the zip tie off, noticed it had a loaded magazine, took that out, but didn't realize there was still a bullet in the chamber.\nSgt. Dean Carriger, of the Sandy Police Department, told us, \u201cHe pointed the gun down at the floor and pulled the trigger, discharging the firearm. Luckily the round struck the floor and ricocheted into a pillar and stopped. Unfortunately the bullet fragments went outward and struck two individuals a 17 year old male and a 13 year old female.\nThey suffered only minor injuries. Sergeant Carriger says no charges will be filed, but he reminds everyone to treat every gun as if it is loaded.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
