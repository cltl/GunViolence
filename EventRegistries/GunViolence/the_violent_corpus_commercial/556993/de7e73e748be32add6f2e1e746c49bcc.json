Worthy said eight children have been shot in the past 17 months as a result of irresponsible gun ownership.\nThe Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s office has handled close to a dozen cases involving incidents in which children were shot after finding a loaded weapon in a home in the past 11/2 years.\nbwilliams@detroitnews.com\n(313) 222-2027"}
