The male, 24-year-old Travonne Tyki Ward, was declared deceased a short time later. After police arrived at the hospital, an officer saw a Volkswagen in the hospital\u2019s parking lot which matched the description of the vehicle that had dropped off the victim. Police made contact with the female driver and brought her to APD for questioning.\nDuring the course of the investigation it was discovered that Ward, the female, 19-year-old Richard E Helme, and one other person had been inside the Volkswagen at Alaska Laser Wash at 5500 Lake Otis Parkway. Helme fired a handgun and the bullet struck Ward in the head. Both Helme and the other passenger immediately exited the vehicle and ran from the area on foot. The female drove Ward to the hospital.\nOn December 23, 2016, APD Detectives obtained an arrest warrant for Helme for Manslaughter, Tampering with Evidence, and Misconduct Involving a Weapon III. Helme was arrested shortly thereafter without incident and incarcerated at the Anchorage Jail; bail will be set at arraignment.\nAPD Case 16-51909\nContact\nEmergency: 9-1-1\nNon-emergencies: 907-786-8900\nRenee Oistad\nPublic Affairs\nroistad@muni.org\n907-786-8686"}
