The victim was uncooperative with police, only stating that the shooting was \"an accident\" but providing no further details.\nOn Wednesday, August 26, 2015, just before 3:00pm, a 17-year-old responded to the Anchorage Police Department to turn himself in for the shooting. The 17-year-old was with his father, and was released into his father's custody after being charged with one count of Assault II and one count of Misconduct Involving a Weapon IV.\nIt appears that the shooting was accidental and that the suspect and victim knew one another. Alcohol and marijuana consumption was a factor on behalf of all parties involved.\nAPD Case 15-34099"}
