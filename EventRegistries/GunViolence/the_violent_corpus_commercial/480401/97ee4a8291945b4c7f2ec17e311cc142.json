The recommendation would go to the Michigan Liquor Control Commission.\n\u201cAfter the most recent shooting, the community really stepped up what their concerns were,\u201d said Lt. Richard Nawrocki, who commands the police departments vice unit. \u201cBased upon the immediate community\u2019s concerns, we believe it fits the criteria for the City Commission\u2019s review for non-renewal.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to prove that the activities have some correlation to the bar here, and that\u2019s what we will try to show.\u201d\nRELATED: Grand Rapids police want to revoke liquor license for New Roosevelt Bar, where 4 were shot last month\nPolice say they have had to respond to incidents at 1447 Grandville Ave. SW more often since the bar got its liquor license in March 2012. The license should not be renewed because the bar has disturbed peace and order in the neighborhood and housed illegal drugs, according to a city memo.\nThe memo shows that many incidents involving police response occurred outside the bar. Bar owner Rosalia Rivera said through an interpreter that closing the bar will not end violence in the neighborhood.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be responsible for what happens outside, even if it\u2019s the parking lot,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair because the city is after us, but not after the real criminals. We want crime to stop in the Southwest Side, and I hope that once we close the violence will stop, but they haven\u2019t arrested people in connection to any of the shootings.\n\u201cThey are cutting the tree, but not the root (of the problem).\u201d\nRELATED: Closing New Roosevelt Bar won't eliminate police calls to the area\nJulie Niemchick, director of the Roosevelt Park Neighborhood Association, said she sympathizes with Rivera. Still, the neighborhood is tired of the violence and wants the bar to close, she said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep affording to have someone injured or murdered in our neighborhood,\u201d Niemchick said. \u201cWe just can\u2019t have that. We can\u2019t tolerate it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the element that keeps showing up at their door that is the problem. If the bar isn\u2019t open, then obviously there won\u2019t be any violence there.\u201d\nMLive reporter Sandra Chang contributed to this report."}
