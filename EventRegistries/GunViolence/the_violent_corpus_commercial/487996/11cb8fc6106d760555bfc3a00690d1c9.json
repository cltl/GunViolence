That's a question many people on Redbud Berry Way were asking in the hours after the child shot himself in the head early Tuesday.\n\"Seems like that could've been avoided if it was put away properly,\" Vicki Seal, neighbor, said.\nDeputies aren't saying where the gun was being stored in the home, but they say the child gained access to the firearm sometime after midnight, while spending the night at his grandparents.\n\"I'm just shocked my heart is pounding,\" Sylvia Chandler, neighbor, said.\nResidents in this neighborhood less than a half mile away from the Premium Outlets say this boy a familiar face around here because he stays at his grandparents regularly.\n\"He was actually playing with my son a couple days ago, very saddened by that,\" Broderick Johnson, neighbor, said.\nInvestigators questioned those grandparents for hours after their wounded grandson was taken away by Life Flight in critical condition.\nJust as authorities were about to clear the scene, the grandmother collapsed to the ground, visibly consumed with emotions.\n\"Praying for them, praying for the medical team to handle it with the utmost care,\" Greg Davis, neighbor, said.\nWhile detectives did not take anybody in custody at the scene, the case isn't closed. It will now be up to a grand jury to decide if charges should be filed."}
