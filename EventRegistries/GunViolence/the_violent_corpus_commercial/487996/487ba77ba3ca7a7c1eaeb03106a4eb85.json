Bryson was breathing and unresponsive.\nHe was rushed to the Texas Medical Center where he remained until his death.\nBryson was visiting his grandparents at their home. Harris County sheriff's officials said they were \"cooperating with investigators fully.\" The findings will be forwarded to a Harris County grand jury.\nChildren's Protective Services also will investigate, but CPS officials said in the past the agency hasn't had any dealings with the family.\nBryson loved and was devoted to two things - his family, especially his sisters, and Iron Man - his favorite superhero.\n\"He looked up to Iron Man because he was strong, fearless and he dedicated his life to helping others,\" the family said in the statement.\nCPS officials want to find out how Bryson was able to gain access to the gun. Last year, at least four children died in Harris County as a result of accidental shootings.\nAdults can be prosecuted for making a firearm accessible to a child, a misdemeanor charge.\nIn the statement released Thursday, family members said they hoped Bryson's death would be a reminder to families with firearms in the home.\n\"Always check to make sure you know where your guns are and that they are safely out of reach of children, not loaded and locked away,\" the statement said.\nBryson, who fought for his life with the bravery of Iron Man, will now save the lives of other children as an organ donor.\nFamily members said he will soon be laid to rest in his Iron Man costume.\n\"We know he wouldn't have had it any other way,\" they said."}
