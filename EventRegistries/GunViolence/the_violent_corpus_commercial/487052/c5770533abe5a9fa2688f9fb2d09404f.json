Three of the four shot were teenagers.\nMemphis Police look at three locations connected to this shooting. Police received calls to the 2800 block of Semmes Avenue and then Jonah Avenue where they found a car somehow connected to the shootings. Overnight officers looked for clues on Brewer Avenue, where shots were fired.\n\"You could see the guns just spraying from the window. Everybody ran to the back room. And I said that they're shooting, they're shooting somebody. I didn't know anybody got shot until we came outside and I saw somebody lying on the ground,\" said resident Carlos Greer describing the gunfire.\nThe three male victims were rushed to The MED. They were ages 18, 19, and 20. The teenage girl, 17, who was also struck by gunfire then went to her home on Semmes Avenue, but she eventually ended up at The MED.\nThe preliminary investigation revealed a disagreement occurred from a dice game and gunfire was exchanged.\n\"We came outside and saw somebody lying on the ground ... What I'm saying we thought he was dead, they put him on a stretcher,\" said Greer.\nThe deceased victim's identity has not yet been released, but he was 19. No charges have been filed at this point.\nCopyright 2013 WMC-TV. All rights reserved."}
