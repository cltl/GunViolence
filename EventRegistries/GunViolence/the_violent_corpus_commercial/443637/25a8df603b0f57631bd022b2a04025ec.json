The friend told police that his car was missing and that he called Figueroa looking for it. After talking to Figueroa, the friend became worried about Mercado.\nThe front door to Mercado's home was broken open. Police found several gunshots throughout the home, said Sgt. Mark Holbrook. Mercado and her daughter were found dead in the kitchen and each had been shot several times, he said.\nPolice have been to the home before, Holbrook said. The residence is among single-story houses in the neighborhood, where Spanish is primarily spoken. Most of the neighbors said they did not know Mercado.\nOne woman outside the home said she worked with Mercado at a bakery. Police were questioning her late Friday afternoon.\nFigueroa and Mercado had been dating for several months. She had three children, two who are school age. Figueroa is not their biological father.\nHe is believed to be driving a maroon Ford Taurus with a Texas license plate CTS 3225. He may be trying to go to Mexico, possibly on a bus, police said.\n\"I've been doing this for 25 years,\" Holbrook said. \"This is a hard scene.\""}
