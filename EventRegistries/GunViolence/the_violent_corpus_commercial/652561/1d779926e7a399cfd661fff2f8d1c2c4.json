There's going to be a renewed emphasis for not only dialogue, but some new procedures to see what we can do in this instance. Obviously that requires their cooperation, but we are going to see if that cooperation can be achieved,\" said J. J. Boem, SVSU spokesman.\nFederspiel is trying to set up a meeting with his staff, the University, campus police and Campus Village management.\n\"There will be changes, I know there will be,\" he said.\nWhat changes are still to be discussed.\nCampus Village has a private security team that was there the night of the party and they have a contract with the sheriff's office for patrols.\n\"The idea is that if individuals see that there's law enforcement there that maybe they won't commit crimes. Obviously that wasn't a deterrent on Sunday morning,\" Federspiel said.\nFederspiel understands some people question why the party wasn't broken up earlier.\n\"It really isn't our place to decide how big of a gathering can occur on private property. It is our place to enforce it when a property owner says enough is enough,\" he said.\nFederspiel says neither apartment management nor security made that request Sunday morning.\nStay with abc12.com for continuing updates.\n--\n(09/11/16) - Five men were shot during a party at an off campus apartment complex near Saginaw Valley State University Sunday morning.\nAll five victims will recover.\nThey were treated at local hospitals and released within hours of the shooting.\nNone of the five victims were SVSU students.\nThe Saginaw County Sheriff's Office is leading the investigation into what unfolded at Campus Village at Cardinal Center Sunday just before 2 a.m. The apartment complex sits off Pierce Road near Davis Road in Kochville Township.\nSixteen shell casings were found during the investigation. It's believed they are all from the same handgun.\nDetectives believe the shooter is a black man in his 20's with blonde or orange tipped dreadlocks.\nThe shooting victims haven't been much help.\n\"We're still hoping the victims will become a little more cooperative than they have been,\" said Bill Federspiel, the Saginaw County sheriff.\nFederspiel says around a thousand people were at the party when the man opened fire.\n\"If he's brazen enough to fire a gun and shoot five people in a crowd of a thousand with a deputy 300 yards away, we need to bring him him,\" Federspiel said.\nA sheriff's deputy, contracted to work at the complex, was on property when the shots were fired.\n\"This shooting occurred even though we had a presence of law enforcement, which is to me, very scary. The fact that we had uniformed patrol with a marked car on the premise, and this shooting still occurred, is very concerning to me,\" Federspiel said.\nDetectives don't know a motive yet.\n\"Witnesses have told us that the person described as the shooter was overheard stating that he was not happy with some of the people who were at that party,\" Federspiel said.\nStudents describe a very scary situation.\n\"I was just enjoying the night and then heard three gunshots and everyone just started running,\" said Max Amato, a student who was at the party.\n\"It was all dark so all you could see was like red, like flashes when the gun goes off,\" said Aaron Hegarty, an SVSU senior.\nPartygoers we talked to say things were fine for most of the night, SVSU celebrating after a big football win over Northwood university.\n\"It was just a big party. Everybody was invited, they had D.J.'s set up back here, everybody was dancing. Then it got to be like 2:00 and then that's when shots rang out,\" said Scott Brown, a student who was at the party. \"It was honestly scary. It was one of those moments when it was fight or flight. And everybody just ran.\"\nWhen the shots were fired people ran through a courtyard to escape, and even into nearby apartments.\n\"One of the victims actually walked into the apartment and took his coat and it was just drenched in blood,\" said Jaclyn Basso, a student who was at the party. \"I was having a lot of fun and then it happened and now, instantly I don't feel safe here. I don't feel safe walking out of my apartment now and I just feel really uncomfortable.\"\n\"One of my buddies came and like start pounding on our door, and we didn't know it was him so, that freaked us out,\" said Clay Freysinger, an SVSU sophomore.\nStudents remain concerned that the shooter is on the loose.\n\"That's scary that they're still on the loose and they could be back here next weekend or whenever, so, hoping they catch him soon,\" Hegarty said.\nThe sheriff's office asks anyone with information about the shooter to call 989-790-5450.\nIf you'd like to remain anonymous call CrimeStoppers at 1-800-422-JAIL.\nA hotline has been established for parents, students and families to call. The number is 989-964-4348. Those calling are asked to reference the shooting at 2207 Pierce Road.\nSVSU spokesman J.J. Boehm released the following statement on behalf of the university:\n\"While this incident happened off campus and we are thankful that no SVSU students were injured, we are actively working to support our students and parents, as well as faculty and staff. As of 11 a.m., we had taken more than 100 phone calls from concerned parents and others who called the hotline we put in place. We will continue to update our campus community and the public, should new developments arise.\nUniversity Police continues to be working closely with the Saginaw County Sheriff's Department, which is leading the investigation.\nBased on the information available, we have resumed normal campus operations; that includes hosting today's 9-11 Heroes Run. We recognize no college campus is a sanctuary, SVSU included, but thanks to a shared commitment to the well-being of others demonstrated by our students, faculty, staff, and alumni, we are proud of our fine record of campus safety over many years. We will remain vigilant in maintaining that level of safety.\""}
