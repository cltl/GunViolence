A 26-year-old man and 14-year-old boy were hunting together, said Jon King, the hunter education administrator at the DNR.\nWhile the 14-year-old was trying to decock the hammer on his lever action rifle, the hammer slipped and the rifle fired, striking the 26-year-old man, who was three feet away, in the left arm, King said. The bullet traveled through the man's left arm, gazed his chest and then entered his right arm.\nThe man was taken to Ministry Saint Joseph's Hospital in Marshfield for medical treatment. King said that 26-year-old gun shot victim was in stable condition the last time the DNR checked Sunday.\nThe shooting in Emmet was one of three hunting incidents where a weapon was involved, resulting in a DNR investigation since the nine-day deer gun season began Saturday, King said.\nThe investigation into the Emmet incident is still underway, King said. Once the DNR completes its report on the shooting, it will pass the information onto the district attorney, who will then decide whether, if any, charges should be filed, he said.\n\"We let the district attorney decide on every case,\" King said.\nReporter Melanie Lawder can be reached at melanie.lawder@gannettwisconsin.com or 715-845-0607.
