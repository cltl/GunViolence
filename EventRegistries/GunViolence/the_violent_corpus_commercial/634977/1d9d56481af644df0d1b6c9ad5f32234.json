He lived in the 1300 block of West Menard.\nA police source said he was a documented gang member.\nA few people stood outside the crime tape watching investigators work early Sunday, but said they didn\u2019t hear or see anything. One young man just starred vacantly into the taped off area and walked away when he was asked if he knew the boy. Evidence markers placed in the westbound lanes of North Avenue showed at least four shots were fired.\nWhen the scene was processed, detectives headed into the building behind where the boy was shot to hunt for security camera footage. Other officers removed the crime scene tape and got in their SUVs and drove away.\nThe blood was left where it lay as early morning risers began to walk the sidewalks."}
