A 50-year-old man was shot and killed; a second man was critically injured.\nStore surveillance cameras led investigators to identify Christon as a suspect. Multiple witnesses also identified him as the shooter.\nChriston's only other run-in with the law was nine days prior, when police pulled him over for speeding. He was driving on a suspended license. According to police records, officers found a loaded handgun in his glove compartment, and they confiscated it.\nGrocery store employees have had their share of troublemakers in the past, but they say Christon was not one of them. In fact, they describe him as a regular and one of their nicest customers. The news that he is now charged in the shooting came as a shock.\nCopyright 2014 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved."}
