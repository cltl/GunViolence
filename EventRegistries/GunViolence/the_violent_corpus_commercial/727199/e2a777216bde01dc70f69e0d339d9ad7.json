He was booked after his release from University Hospital for six counts of attempted-murder of a police officer, aggravated flight from an officer, vehicular trespassing, and possession of a stolen vehicle.\nBrown was driving a Kia Optima that was stolen from Kenner on Dec. 3, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said. A license plate recognition camera identified the Kia Thursday in Marrero at 9:12 p.m., prompting Normand to flood the area with officers. Normand added that Brown fired shots from the Kia at officers when they tried to stop him at the corner of Armstrong and Millender drives at 9:31 p.m.\nThe chase continued into Gretna, where Brown would collide with a barricade at the intersection of 4th and Weyer streets. Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson said Brown tried to run over officers at the barricade, where the unidentified officer suffered a leg injury. Lawson said the officer is in good condition.\nThe Sheriff's Office said Brown then fired shots at them again, leading 10 deputies and two Gretna police officers to return fire. Brown would later escape from the car and jump over several fences, running across residential yards before officers and police dogs located him bleeding and hiding in the backseat of gray truck."}
