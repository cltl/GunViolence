Larry McKinnon said.\nThe 9-year-old, 11-year-old and their 13-year-old brother were home alone at 5721 Turkey Tree Lane in Plant City when they took the .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun from their mother\u2019s locked bedroom, McKinnon said.\nThe mother had secured the bedroom door with a padlock and hasp but the three boys managed to get inside the door by removing the hasp. The gun was owned by the mother\u2019s boyfriend, McKinnon said.\nThe boys took the gun behind the rural home and spent 30 to 45 minutes target practicing before returning it to the mother\u2019s bedroom, McKinnon said.\nThe two younger brothers returned to the bedroom to retrieve the gun and it discharged, hitting the 9-year-old in the cheek. The sheriff\u2019s office received a 911 call just before 1 p.m..\nThe child was taken from the home, just west of Turkey Creek Road, to a local hospital. He was listed in serious condition.\n\u201cThe mother is visibly shaken as you might imagine. The boys are very upset,\u201d McKinnon said.\nThe department said it would not release any names until it determines whether criminal charges will be filed. McKinnon noted that the mother did take steps to secure the gun.\nHillsborough property records list the owner of the home on Turkey Tree Lane as Gene Bailey.\nThe mother was at work at the time of the shooting and the boys\u2019 18-year-old sister, who also lives at the home, was not there either.\nSheriff\u2019s investigators with the Child Protective Division were assisting in the case. The family is cooperating. McKinnon said the shooting serves as a reminder that parents should talk to their children about guns.\n\u201cYou should always educate your children about firearms safety,\u201d he said.\ndnicholson@tampatrib.com"}
