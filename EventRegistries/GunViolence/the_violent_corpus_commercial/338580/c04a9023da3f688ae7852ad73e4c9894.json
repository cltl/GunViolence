He is being held on $1 million bail.\nCourt records show Tolbert was shot as he was hanging out in a Tacoma parking lot May 11 with other young men. Someone in Tolbert's group fired a gun at a car as it passed, and his acquaintances told police someone inside the car returned fire.\nProsecutors say the state crime lab later determined the bullet that killed Tolbert came from a revolver police found on the suspect when they stopped a car he was in a few days later.\nDetectives who interviewed the suspect reportedly said he was despondent over accidentally shooting his friend.\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
