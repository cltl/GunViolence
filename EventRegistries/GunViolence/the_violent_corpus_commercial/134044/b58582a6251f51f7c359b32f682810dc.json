Investigators believe Malone and Dixon witnessed that murder.\nThe suspects in that case are Cutrez Johnson, 16; Oshlushla Smith, 20; and Kamontay Cullins, 19.\nIn addition to Dixon, police also suspect them of shooting Malone.\nInvestigators are looking at the home invasion as a possible retaliation for Malone's death, because Johnson and Smith are blood relatives to the women who were shot in the home.\nPolice say two to three masked gunmen broke into the home and chased the women upstairs to a bathroom.\nThey then kicked the door in and opened fire on the group, killing Kendarius, investigators said.\nCopyright 2014 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).
