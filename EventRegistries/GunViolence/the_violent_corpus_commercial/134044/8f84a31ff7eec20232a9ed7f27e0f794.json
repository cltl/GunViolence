He was sentenced to life plus 40 years in prison.\n\"This sentence sends a loud message that gangs are not welcome here in DeKalb County,\" District Attorney Robert James said in a statement.\nVictim Malone was also a Bloods member, according to prosecutors. On May 3, 2014, she and another woman were involved in a fight during a party at a Stone Mountain apartment complex. Several more Bloods members arrived to help Malone and began shooting. Phillips, an innocent bystander, was killed in the gunfire.\nAccording to the investigation, Smith was concerned that Malone, 17, would go to the police with information about Phillips's death. On May 9, 2014, Smith lured Malone into a wooded area and killed her by striking her head and face with a rock.\nSmith and co-defendant Cutrez Johnson were arrested at an Atlanta hotel after a long SWAT standoff. Johnson was sentenced in a separate trial to 20 years, with 15 to serve in prison.\nOn May 10, 2014, two more Bloods members broke into a house on To Lani Farm Road in Stone Mountain and shot 9-month-old KenDarious Edwards Jr. to death. The victim was Smith's nephew. Prosecutors believe the baby and his family were targeted in retaliation for Malone's murder.\nJames said late last year he will seek the death penalty for Devin Thomas, the suspect accused of killing Edwards."}
