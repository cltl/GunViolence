Some of the guests were not invited.\nWhile the fight was on the television inside one of the garden apartments, some of the party-goers took their drinking and socializing outside into a grassy area.\nEventually there was an argument and 29-year-old Michael Phillips, though his hand were raised in surrender, was shot in the head.\nA week later, a potential witness to Phillips\u2019 shooting was found dead.\nOslushla Smith, 19 and known to fellow gang members as Budda or Boo, and Cutrez Johnson, 16, known as Lil Red, were charged several weeks ago with killing Phillips at the May 3 party and with killing Alexis Malone, the witness, seven days later.\nAnother woman, Kayla Dixon, 19, is also charged with murdering Malone, who was a friend of Thomas. Dixon was indicted in early August.\nJust a few hours after an anonymous tip led police to Malone\u2019s body on Agape Way in DeKalb County, men wearing bandanas to hide their faces kicked in the back door of the home on Lani Farm Road. Three terrified women inside grabbed the baby, ran upstairs and tried to lock themselves into a bathroom, but the gunmen kicked it in and fired at them multiple times.\nThe baby was Smith\u2019s nephew.\n\u201cThis senseless act ended the life of an innocent child,\u201d DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James said in a statement. \u201cFar too often we see the impact of gang violence and other mindless acts of terror spilling into our schools, neighborhoods and even our homes.\u201d"}
