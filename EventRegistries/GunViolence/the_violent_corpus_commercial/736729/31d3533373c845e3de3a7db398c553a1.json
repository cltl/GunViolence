Harmon, 71, died at his home on Brunelle Avenue after a handgun he was showing to a teenage boy went off while the 16-year-old was handling it.\nHarmon, a steadfast defender of gun rights and a champion of conservative viewpoints, was a longtime editor and columnist for the Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram. He worked for the newspaper for 41 years, and continued to write a weekly column after he retired in 2011.\nThe teenage boy and his father, both from North Berwick, were visiting Harmon\u2019s home at the time of the shooting, police said. They have been cooperating with the investigation and detectives were expected to question them again Thursday.\nTheir names are not being released because the shooting is still under investigation, state police spokesman Steve McCausland said Thursday night.\n\u201cThe circumstances under which the gun was introduced is still under investigation,\u201d said McCausland, who did not know why the gun was loaded. \u201cIt is just one of the many questions we have.\u201d\nHe declined to release further details Thursday. An autopsy of Harmon\u2019s body will be done at the state Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, and the case will be reviewed by the state Attorney General\u2019s Office. The results of the autopsy were not available Thursday night.\nHarmon\u2019s wife, Margaret Harmon, declined Thursday to discuss details of the shooting, calling it an \u201caccidental tragedy.\u201d\nPolice have not described the type of handgun involved. They also have not disclosed what connection the teen and his father had to Harmon.\nCONSERVATIVE, GUN-RIGHTS DEFENDER\nHarmon graduated from high school in Pennsylvania before attending Bowdoin College in Brunswick, where he graduated cum laude in 1967. He served in the Army from 1967 to 1969, including a stint in Vietnam, and in the Army Reserves from 1970 to 1975.\nHarmon started his career at the Evening Express and the Press Herald in 1970, working as a reporter before becoming city editor, managing editor and then an editorial writer. In retirement, he continued to write his weekly column and take on freelance assignments.\nHarmon was known as a conservative thinker and a staunch defender of gun rights in his newspaper columns, including some that argued against the recent failed referendum to require background checks for private gun purchases.\nIn a Sept. 13, 1993, editorial column, Harmon wrote about the importance of everyone\u2019s constitutional right to own a firearm.\n\u201cI view threats to that freedom as seriously as I do threats to my right to vote, or speak freely, or worship as I please,\u201d he wrote.\nIn that same column, Harmon wrote that he had belonged to the National Rifle Association from the day of his first paycheck.\nORDAINED PRIEST, SCHOOL LEADER\nIn 2016, Harmon was ordained a priest in the Charismatic Episcopal Church. He served as a principal of the Church of the Prince of Peace School in Sanford, according to his LinkedIn page. He taught world history, English and American literature to juniors and seniors.\nHarmon is survived by his wife, three children from a previous marriage, two stepchildren and several grandchildren.\nPress Herald publisher Lisa DeSisto said Harmon\u2019s former colleagues were saddened to learn of his death.\n\u201cHe contributed his voice and perspective to thousands of readers for more than four decades,\u201d she said. \u201cOur thoughts are with his family and our colleagues who worked closely with him for those many years.\u201d\nSen. Susan Collins released a statement Thursday reacting to Harmon\u2019s death.\n\u201cI was saddened to learn of M.D. Harmon\u2019s tragic death. For four decades, M.D. Harmon was a dedicated editor and columnist,\u201d she said. \u201cHis passing is a loss to his family and friends, his colleagues, and to generations of readers across the state.\u201d"}
