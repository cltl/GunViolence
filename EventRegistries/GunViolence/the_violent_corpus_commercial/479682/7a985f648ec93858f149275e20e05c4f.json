She said people picked up those children and scattered in all directions.\n\u201cOut of the blue,\u201d said witness Nathaniel Hilliard. \u201cI had never been anywhere where I\u2019d heard all those guns.\u201d\nHilliard\u2019s wife, Cora, was holding a friend\u2019s baby.\n\u201cThe only thing I could do is cuddle the child and get down low,\u201d she said.\nBy the time police arrived, four people, an 18-year-old man, a 19-year-old man, a 22-year-old man and an 11-year-old boy, were all hit. None have life-threatening injuries. They were taken to area hospitals.\nA police report states several car windows and tires were also shot out.\nPolice have not made any arrests and said they don\u2019t have a motive in the crime.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re going to see is a lot more officers,\u201d said Deputy Chief Kerr Putney with CMPD. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be engaging the public respectfully, but intentionally, trying to make sure we\u2019re proactive in what we do to prevent future gun violence.\u201d\nThe vigil organizer said nothing like this has ever happened at one of the MOMO events. The vigil honored Javon Booker, who died after he was shot during a convenience store robbery.\n\u201cPlease, no more shooting,\u201d said Judy Williams with MOMO. \u201cNo more guns. Please. We\u2019re begging you.\u201d\nNeighbors said they are upset and confused. They said they can\u2019t believe someone would fire shots at a vigil that was dedicated to ending violence.\n\"It's sad. you know. It's scary. I was at work when it happened. It's nerve-racking, you know,\" said neighbor Kristina Fleming.\nCrime Stoppers is offering up to a $5,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest of the suspect in this case.\nAnyone with further information concerning this shooting or the suspect\u2019s identity is asked to call the Crime Stopper\u2019s tip-line at 704-334-1600, or visit http://charlottecrimestoppers.com."}
