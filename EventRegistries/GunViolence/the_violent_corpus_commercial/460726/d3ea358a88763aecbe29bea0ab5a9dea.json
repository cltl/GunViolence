Then I also heard a car speeding off after the gunshots,\u201d the woman told CBS2\u2019s Kristine Lazar.\nPolice said a person in the speeding car was driving one of the victims to the hospital. That man later died.\nThe three other victims were taken to the hospital and are expected to survive.\nAnother woman who wished to remain anonymous told Lazar that she believes gangs are to blame for what happened.\n\u201cFrom my understanding, Hawthorne does not belong to one gang. It\u2019s a melting pot of all different gangs, which is what makes it so dangerous,\u201d she said.\nOfficials haven\u2019t yet made any arrests in connection to the shootings."}
