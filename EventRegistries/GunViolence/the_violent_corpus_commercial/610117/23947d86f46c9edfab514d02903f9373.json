It happened at a home on North Main Street while his friend was visiting.\nThat friend, police said, had stolen a gun from a nearby car and had it out when it went off.\n\"We recommend not hauling your vehicles around and storing them in your vehicle loaded,\" said Lt. Tim Mullen with Huntingburg Police. \"If it's in your vehicle loaded, we don't recommend that because vehicles are broken into all the time. If someone breaks into your car or a burglary they've got a weapon and they've got a loaded weapon.\"\nRick Chambers with the Dubois County Prosecuting Attorney's Office said over the next few days, he is reviewing evidence with the lead investigator to find out if additional charges are possible. Investigators have not released the suspect's name yet because the suspect is a juvenile.\nFriends of the victim said Kendall's funny nature and light heart will stay with them forever.\n\"I remember him as a funny, outgoing person, someone who could light up a room where ever he was at, with just a crack of a joke or a smile or some stupid gesture that he would always do,\" said Jassmian Cissell.\nRight now, the 15-year-old suspect is facing charges of reckless homicide and theft. He's at the juvenile detention center.\nCopyright 2016 WFIE. All rights reserved."}
