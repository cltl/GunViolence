Garza said the boy was shot in the foot and suffered a head injury that may have been caused by a bullet or broken glass. He is expected to survive.\nThe shooting happened around 8:15 p.m. in the 1400 block of East Duff Avenue, Garza said. The boy and his mother were sitting in a car when two individuals walked up and fired several shots.
