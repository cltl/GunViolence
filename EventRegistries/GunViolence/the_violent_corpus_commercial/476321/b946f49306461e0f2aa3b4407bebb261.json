Tuwan Minor, 20, was booked Friday (March 4) on four counts of aggravated battery.\nAt least one gunman jumped out of a dark four-door vehicle and opened fire on a gathering outside a home, 6th District Commander Ronnie Stevens said the night of the shooting. Police were called about 9:45 p.m. NOPD spokesman Tyler Gamble said Monday (March 7) he is checking into whether Stevens is suspected of acting alone.\nGamble said Minor was also shot, but the other shooter has not been identified. That person will face criminal charges, Gamble said.\nTwo 16-year-old girls said they were talking in the 1600 block of Amelia that night when multiple shots rang out. One of the girls, whose knees were scraped, said she threw herself to the ground behind a parked car. From that vantage point she said she saw a young man calling out \"I'm shot! I'm shot! I'm shot!\"\n\"He was holding himself limping,\" she said.\nNOTE: This post has been updated to include additional information from Tyler Gamble\nNew Orleans police were at the scene of a shooting in the 1900 block of Amelia Street Thursday night that left five injured."}
