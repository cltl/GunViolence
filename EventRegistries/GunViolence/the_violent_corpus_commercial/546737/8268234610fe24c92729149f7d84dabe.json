Two other children were shot and killed on Easter and on April 16 in what police are calling suspected gang-related shootings and which are believed to be connected.\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig is expected to address at a news conference Monday the recent violence that has snagged yet another child in another bloody weekend.\nThe latest shooting on the west side appears to have happened as a father was teaching his 4-year-old boy to ride his bike about 5 p.m. Saturday, police said. The 24-year-old father was killed in the incident on Monica.\nDetroit police are asking for the public\u2019s help tracking the whereabouts of two masked gunmen and have said they are baffled why anyone would target a child.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard on the community and on the responding officers,\u201d said Deputy Chief Steve Dolunt. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make any sense of it. There used to be a code among criminals: You don\u2019t mess with kids or senior citizens, but that seems to be gone.\n\u201c ... Why would you shoot a kid? I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t understand the mindset, but we\u2019re constantly trying to figure this out, but the problem is, how do you get into the mind of someone with a total lack of regard for life? It makes you speechless. I can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\nIn the Saturday incident, police said two men wearing ski masks emerged from a gray Chevy Equinox and started shooting. The 4-year-old was listed in temporary serious condition, said Officer Nicole Kirkwood.\nThe masked men were last seen heading south on Monica, which is west of Livernois and south of Seven Mile. Police ask anyone with information to call the homicide section at (313) 596-2260.\nSaturday\u2019s incident follows the fatal shooting of 3-year-old A\u2019Naiya Denise Montgomery about 2 a.m. Easter morning on the 16800 block of Riverview on the west side.\nOne of three suspects held in the shooting, Paul Kendall Jr., 24, took his life Wednesday, the Wayne County Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\nOn April 16, 6-month-old Miracle Murray was killed as a 24-year-old man played on the front lawn of the home on Winthrop with two other children.\nOn Saturday, Miracle\u2019s mother pleaded for her killer to come forward.\n\u201cI just hope somebody speaks up,\u201d said Jennifer Murray, holding back tears.\n\u201cTurn him in, my baby didn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d\nDolunt, reflecting on what appeared to be the indiscriminate shootings of children, said more conflict resolution skills are needed.\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t shoot someone when you have a problem with them,\u201d he said.\n\u201c(But) if you don\u2019t respect yourself, how can you respect someone else?\u201d\njdickson@detroitnews.com\nStaff Writer George Hunter contributed."}
