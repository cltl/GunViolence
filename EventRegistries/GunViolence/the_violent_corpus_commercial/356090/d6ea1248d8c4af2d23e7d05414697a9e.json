He was found Thursday afternoon with a gunshot wound to the chest at an apartment at 709 Gordon Smith Boulevard.\n\u201cShe ran outside screaming and yelling that she needed a phone,\u201d said Amanda Reid, a neighbor.\nReid recounted to media that she saw the boy\u2019s mother run out of the apartment carrying the boy and screaming that he shot himself in the chest. An image she hopes no parent has to see.\n\u201cPut your guns up, lock em\u2019 up, if you feel like you have to have them, lock up and don\u2019t have them loaded,\u201d said Reid.\nPolice say the mother called 911 and told dispatchers that she carried the weapon in her purse. She set it down after getting home.\nThe boy died at the hospital.\nGun expert, Ray Nickel says gun-owners need to arm themselves with safety information so tragedies like these don\u2019t happen.\n\u201cYou have to be constantly aware and not just initially you cant get lax on storage, keeping a conscious effort to know where your firearm is and where your child is at all times,\u201d said Nickel.\nNickel says you also want to know how to store it, firearms can be kept in a locked safe or something inexpensive like a trigger lock.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mechanism that goes onto firearms in such a manner that it prevents anyone from actually contacting the trigger and firing the firearm,\u201d explained Nickel.\nButler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser says the case will be heard before a grand jury to decide upon charges.\nThis is the second incident in just over a week in Hamilton in which children playing with a gun ended tragically. A 16-year-old boy is charged with reckless homicide after shooting a 14-year-old boy on June 3 while the two were playing with a gun.\nThe .5 million project is at the I-70 and Ohio 41\u2026\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
