Gleason, 15, of Hutchinson, came into the Hutchinson Regional Medical Center emergency room with a gunshot wound to the foot, said Lt. Thad Pickard.\nGleason said he did not know the gun was loaded when he pointed it to the ground and accidentally shot himself at a residence in the 300 block of East 11th Avenue.\nGleason was undergoing surgery early Monday morning to remove the bullet lodged in his foot, Pickard said. His condition was unavailable, as HRMC does not release youths\u2019 conditions.\nEthan B. Edgar, 15, reportedly lied to police when they asked where the gun was, Pickard said.\nOfficers found the gun buried at a different location.\nEdgar was arrested for interference with law enforcement, concealing evidence, interference with law enforcement and possession of a firearm under 18 years old, according to the HPD bulletin.\nOfficers are still investigating how Edgar obtained the firearm."}
