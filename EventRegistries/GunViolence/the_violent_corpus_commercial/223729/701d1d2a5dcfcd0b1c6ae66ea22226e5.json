Michael Haytas with the Coroner\u2019s Office said Lewis did not die at the scene. Lewis was taken to Springfield Regional Medical Center where he passed away. An autopsy will be done Saturday on Lewis.\nSpringfield Police said Lewis has been arrested before and has a criminal history.\nRaymone West, Brian Dearmond and Marquise McPherson were also struck by bullets. Their injuries are non-life threatening.\nAccording to a police report, West and McPherson showed up to Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital around 3 a.m. Saturday to be treated for gunshot wounds. Both told police they had blacked out and couldn\u2019t remember what happened. Both men were transferred to Miami Valley Hospital for treatment.\nSabreena Jordan who grew up in the neighborhood says violent crimes are happening more often.\n\u201cIts crazy, its too close to home, there was one that happened right down the street from my house\u201d said Sabreena Jordan, Springfield resident.\nPolice say near Lewis\u2019 body, was an Oldsmobile Cutlass littered with bullet holes. At this point, investigators are unclear how these four men knew each other.\nOne woman, who didn\u2019t want to go on camera thinks the shooting may be related to past violence.\n\u201cUnfortunately I think it was just a conflict between two people that went too far, I think it has to do with several other crimes over the summer\u201d said another Springfield resident.\nInvestigators say they have possible suspects, but aren\u2019t releasing details at this time"}
