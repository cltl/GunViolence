The cousin later told police that Mendoza was the only one in the room with Bandemer, and Mendoza was the one with the gun.\nAfter Bandemer\u2019s cousin walked outside to smoke a cigarette, he heard a \u201cpop.\u201d The cousin returned to find Bandemer bleeding and began to apply pressure to the gunshot wound, Sedelmaier said.\nMendoza threw away the shotgun in high grass in front of an abandoned house, Sedelmaier said. \u201cAfter about a minute, the defendant came back from hiding the gun and he has blood on him and asked the cousin what happened,\u201d she said.\nPolice arrived and took Mendoza into custody. When he was put in the back of a police squad car, he posted a video on Snapchat, admitting to killing his friend.\n\u201cI killed Chris and now I'm going to kill myself,\u201d the defendant said, according to Sedelmaier.\nDefense attorney Mike Johnson characterized the shooting as an \u201caccident,\u201d adding that Mendoza had \u201cno animosity toward\u201d the victim.\n\u201cWhat this is, is a tragedy. An absolute tragedy,\u201d said Chiampas as she set bond, later saying there wasn't enough evidence to make her believe the shooting was intentional.\nAs a condition of bond, the judge ordered there be no firearms in the household.\nBefore the he was taken into custody, Mendoza, with slicked back hair and a furrowed brow, looked back into the gallery, where a small group of friends and family stood in the last row.\nTwitter @_tonybriscoe"}
