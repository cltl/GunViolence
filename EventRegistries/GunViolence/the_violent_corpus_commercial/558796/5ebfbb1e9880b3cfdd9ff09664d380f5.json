Steve Cooper, chief of detectives for the Charleston Police Department. Three other victims were taken to Charleston Area Medical Center General Hospital with injuries that are not life threatening, Cooper said.\n\u201cThere had been another altercation between these two groups at a different party somewhere else in Charleston; they were ejected from that location and both parties ended up at the Boondocks bar,\u201d Cooper said.\nNumerous shots were fired from more than one shooter inside and outside the bar, Cooper said.\nA vehicle carrying shooting victims initially fled the scene to go to a hospital but police stopped it and helped get them to the hospital, Cooper said.\nOne victim was shot approximately seven times, but the man\u2019s wounds do not appear to be life-threatening, Cooper said.\nThe incident happened during an after party for rapper Rico Richie, who according to social media posts was scheduled to perform at Beni Kedem earlier in the night.\n\u201c[The after party] doesn\u2019t seem to have any particular bearing on the shooting itself,\u201d Cooper said.\nCooper said the number of guns found at the scene led investigators to believe that several people were carrying hidden firearms at the party. He declined to say how many weapons were found.\n\u201cThe Charleston Police Department has been receiving complaints about problems at Boondocks for a while,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThis incident last night was horrific. It\u2019s amazing that more people weren\u2019t hurt or killed. We had officers arriving on the scene as shots were still being fired.\n\u201cFortunately none of them were hurt and the officers weren\u2019t forced to use deadly force,\u201d Cooper said.\nNo arrest had been made Saturday evening, but Cooper said police were actively investigating a lead. Police have not released the names of the other victims.\nState Alcohol Beverage Control Administration spokesman Gig Robinson said Saturday afternoon the ABC is suspending the bar\u2019s alcohol license to \u201csend the message that this type of violence that\u2019s happening in and around a licensed establishment is just not acceptable.\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s shooting marked the first on the West Side in four months, Cooper said. Nate Chaney, 22, of Charleston, was shot to death in broad daylight on Jan. 14 while in the parking lot at Littlepage Terrace apartments, on Washington Street West. The city\u2019s last shooting injured two people in Kanawha City Jan. 30.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that this happened, but we are grateful for the four months of peace we\u2019ve had between shootings,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d\nReach Lori Kersey at lori.kersey@wvgazettemail.com, 304-348-1240 or follow @LoriKerseyWV on Twitter."}
