Police say an armed man attempted to rob the restaurant, but the robbery went sour and he eventually raised his weapon to his own head.\nPHOTOS: Attempted robbery scene in SE Houston\nCustomers and employees quickly cleared out of the restaurant, at which point the man began to fire his weapon, although police do not believe the suspect was firing at officers.\nOne ambulance on scene outside Wendy's on Almeda Genoa.

Inside the bank, the suspect fired additional shots, but -- again -- not toward officers.\nAuthorities sent dogs in to incapacitate the man so he could be safely taken into custody. At the same time, an officer's weapon accidentally discharged, grazing another officer.\nThe accidental discharge also frightened a police dog, which then bit another officer, causing minor injury.\nAt that point, the suspect then came out with his gun still held to his head. He pulled the trigger, but his weapon was out of bullets.\nAnother canine took down the suspect, and officers were able to take him into custody.\nBoth of the injured officers were taken to Memorial Hermann Southeast with minor injuries.\nRoads in the area remain blocked off as the investigation continues."}
