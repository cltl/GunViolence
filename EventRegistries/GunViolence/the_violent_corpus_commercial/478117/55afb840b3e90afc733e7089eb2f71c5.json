Police say they were trying to turn around. Their car headlights shined into the car of the suspected gunman. Police say for some reason that made him angry and he pulled out a gun. The family tried to get away by driving into the apartment complex, but investigators say the suspect followed, firing at them around nine times.\nOne of the bullets went through the car and hit the little girl in the back. She went through surgery because the bullet may be lodged near her spine.\nSAPD says the family managed to make it to the 200 block of South WW White Road where they spotted a patrol car and pulled over at a motel parking lot for help.\nSAPD said officers took a person of interest into custody who was reportedly driving a car that matched the suspected car involved. However, police said that person was arrested on an unrelated felony warrant, felony evading and resisting arrest.\nPolice said that person has not been charged in connection with the shooting and is considered a person of interest.\nAccording to SAPD, the child was able to receive medical attention and was in surgery shortly after the incident. More information on her condition was not immediately available.\nThis is a developing story, and Kens5.com will continue to post updates."}
