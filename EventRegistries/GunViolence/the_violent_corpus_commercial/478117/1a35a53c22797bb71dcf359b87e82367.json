She is in the hospital recovering from her injuries.\nAlthough the shooting was tragic, Greene said the shooting could have resulted in more injuries.\n\"If the driver would have stayed, we could have seen possibly four fatalities,\u201d he said.\nFollowing the shooting, police saw a man in a vehicle matching the suspect\u2019s car leaving the complex and gave pursuit. He was arrested by SAPD SWAT team officers a few miles away.\n\u201cThat particular individual had a felony warrant out for his arrest,\" Greene said. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was running from police.\u201d\nThe man was arrested on the felony warrant and is in custody but has not been charged with the child\u2019s shooting.\n\u201cAt this point we don\u2019t have enough information to say that he is definitively the shooter,\u201d Greene said.\nCopyright 2015 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}
