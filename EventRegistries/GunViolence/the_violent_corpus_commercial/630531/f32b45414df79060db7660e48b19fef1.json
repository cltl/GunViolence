The shooting happened at about 9:40 p.m.\n\u201cWe have not identified any suspects,\u201d Riviera Beach Police Chief Clarence Williams told local television station WPTV Channel 5. \u201cIt looks as though, from the physical scene, that an individual was laying in wait as the car approached the parking spot and that an individual began firing.\u201d\nWilliams said most of the rounds were fired through the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle, leading police to believe the target was the 24-year-old man driving the car. None of the victims had been named as of Monday morning.\nWilliams said it was not a random act and that the incident likely evolved from an earlier fight in which the driver was threatened. The Post reported that the two victims were the 48th and 49th in the Palm Beach County city so far this year and that the dead child was the youngest to have been killed in 2016 in the county."}
