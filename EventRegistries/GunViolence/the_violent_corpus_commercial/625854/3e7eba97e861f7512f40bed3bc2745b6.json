She was immediately taken to a local veterinarian to be treated after she was shot twice and found with bullet entrance and exit wounds, police said. Greenwood Police Chief Will Dawson said Kina has wounds to her neck and back.\nX-Rays showed some bullet fragments still lodged in Kina. The veterinarian told police had she been shot two inches lower on one of the shots, she would not have survived. Kina is also dehydrated, but receiving fluids.\nWhen Kina was spotted, she came to her handler, Cpl. Dennis Wisner, and the two went to the veterinarian together. She was still wearing her bullet-proof vest when she was found.\nOfficers and volunteers have been searching for Kina ever since she disappeared during the gunfight with suspect Billy Jones at home off Highway 253, police said. The K-9 had been in Wisner\u2019s vehicle when she was shot. Kina then took off and officers found blood in her kennel, leading them to believe she had been hit.\nCrews used ATVs and helicopters to aid in the search."}
