Police say he's an acquaintance of the girl's father.\n\"There was a physical altercation between the father and the neighbors, and a firearm was retrieved,\" said police spokeswoman Jennifer Moreno said, adding that two other people were taken into custody earlier in the case.\nPolice this morning said the girl had died. But this afternoon, the report was corrected at an afternoon news conference to indicate she's alive. Brian Taylor, spokesman of the St. John Hospital and Medical Center, said by phone this afternoon that the girl is in critical condition.\nRelated: Detroit police promise community action after kids shot\nRiley column: Detroit doesn't need protests, it needs to protect its kids\nRelated:Grandparents charged in fatal shooting of Detroit girl, 5\nSmelley's arrest came after Detroit Police received a tip at around 11 a.m. that he was staying in a hotel at 8 Mile near Greenfield. When Oak Park and Detroit Police made entry with a key, Smelley was alone in the room and announced who he was, and he was arrested without a struggle, Detroit Police Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt said at the news conference.\n\"When I got the phone call, I kind of got choked up,\" Dolunt said. \"This one hurt, a lot. The young girl wasn't even 3. This one hits hard. For all of us who have grandkids or kids. ... When an innocent child gets shot over stupid stuff ... it's just senseless. So I'm relieved, and maybe a little later, I'll probably break down.\"\nPolice declined to release the girl's name. She was shot on the 16400 block of Fairmont on Detroit's east side, about six blocks south of 8 Mile and two blocks east of Redmond Street.\nOak Park police were familiar with Smelley, said Lt. Marlon Benson, who added without elaborating further: \"We've had enough contact with him to know who he was.\"\nRecords show Smelley was released from parole in January 2015 after convictions for assault and using a firearm while committing a felony.\nInitial reports from the police stated the child was 3 years old; this story has been updated to reflect the correct age.\nContact Robert Allen @rallenMI or rallen@freepress.com."}
