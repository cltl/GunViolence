Officers then located another teenage boy with a gunshot wound that had left the scene before law enforcement arrived. The teens were aged 15, 15, 16 and 17.\nAccording to Captain Jim Varrone, the four teenagers were treated and released from the hospital.\nPolice believe Simpson and the four other teens were shot after a dark colored sedan drove by the corner and fired multiple shots.\nVarrone says investigators believe two other shootings that happened a short time later on Clay Street and South 17th Street were connected and all were gang-related. He added that most of the victims from the initial shooting are validated gang members or have gang affiliations.\nVarrone declined to say which gangs were believed to be involved, but did say police are looking for more than one suspect and charges are pending.\nChief Ralph Evangelous said the community needs to step up to prevent gang violence. Evangelous said family and friends of gang members have a responsibility to come forward with information before more violence crimes happen.\nEvangelous also said current methods like ankle bracelets are not effective.\n\"Our job is to protect society and ankle bracelets are not protecting society,\" Evangelous explained. \"I can tell you that right now, and tell your legislators that. Some people need to be incarcerated. They\u2019re a danger to society. We put ankle bracelets on them and that\u2019s going to solve all our problems \u2013 well, folks it is not.\"\nRepresentative Susi Hamilton agreed.\n\u201cI take to heart what he says that if they\u2019re not being effective, they\u2019re not working for the use in which they were intended to be used then something else has to be done,\" Hamilton said.\nAnyone with information on this shooting are asked to call the Wilmington Police Department at 910-343-3609 or text your info to Text-A-Tip.\nCopyright WECT.
