Cory told police he teaches his daughters about gun safety, and he had been teasing one of them that that she couldn't cock the .22 caliber handgun he kept in a bedroom safe.\nCory says the weapon had five rounds in the tumbler, but he took apart the tumbler and pin before letting the girl handle the gun, according to the report.\nHe told police, after taking the gun back from her it \"grenaded\" in his hand, discharging a round into his daughter's chest. Police say he later gave a conflicting story that the girl was holding the gun when it went off, but she told a nurse at UMC that Cory was holding it at that time.\nCory told police he bought the gun from a stranger for $100 six months ago. Officers searched the home and found another handgun, as well as a BB gun.\nCory's daughter is expected to survive the incident. Cory was arrested at UMC on charges of child neglect with substantial bodily harm.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
