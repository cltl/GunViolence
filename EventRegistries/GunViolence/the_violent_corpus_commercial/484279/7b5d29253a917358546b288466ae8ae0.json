Police said the gunman was in one car and was pursuing the victims in another car. At least 30 rounds were fired. No residents in their homes were hurt. The victims' car crashed when the driver was shot. The shooter's car fled the scene.\n\"When (police) arrived on scene, there was a male and female inside the vehicle that we contacted and two other individuals fled from the scene. A local resident called because (the shooting victims) had been banging on their door, so we were able to pick (the shooting victims) up as well,\" said Vallejo Police Sgt. Brett Clark.\nAll four victims are expected to survive.\nPolice said they don't know the motive behind the attack and the victims are not cooperating. All police have been told is that the shooter was in a white small car and they do not have suspect description. Police said the casings from the shootings came from a handgun and rifles - so there may have been more than one shooter."}
