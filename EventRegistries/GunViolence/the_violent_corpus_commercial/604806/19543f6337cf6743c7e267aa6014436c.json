Smith was killed and a 16-year-old boy was wounded in a shooting early Sunday in a Kenwood neighborhood alley.\nIt happened just outside Michelle Fulton\u2019s bedroom window.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d Fulton, 49, said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot, but nothing like this.\u201d\nThe teens were walking in the alley about 12:50 a.m. in the 4700 block of South Ellis when a red minivan pulled up and someone inside opened fire, according to Chicago Police.\nSmith, of the 7300 block of South Dorchester, was shot multiple times and was pronounced dead at the scene at 1:15 a.m., according to police and the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office.\nThe other boy suffered a gunshot wound to the left leg and was taken to a hospital in serious condition, police said.\nA GoFundMe page has been set up by the family to help with funeral expenses.\nThe teen\u2019s body could be seen lying a few yards from at least eight shell casings on the alley sidewalk next to Fulton\u2019s building.\nFulton, who has lived in the building for 17 years, said she was watching \u201cGame Of Thrones\u201d when she heard eight gunshots.\nWhen she looked out of her window into the alley, she saw one boy lying in a pool of blood and the other running, but limping, and yelling, \u201cHelp me somebody, help me! He shot my brother, they killed my brother! He\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead!\u201d\nFulton said she saw the minivan drive out of the alley, turn north on Ellis and stop at the light on 47th Street, before completing a left turn.\n\u201cThey waited for the light to change before they turned left,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was crazy.\u201d\nThe boy with the leg wound rested against one of several cars parked outside the building while he waited for paramedics, Fulton added.\nA mother of three, she said she is worried about her 19-year-old son.\n\u201cThe streets are calling his name every day, that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking,\u201d she said, adding she will never forget the sight of the teen\u2019s body lying in her alley.\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of undone tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cYou hear about it, but when you see something like this happen\u2014I have a son, it could\u2019ve been him. Thank God it wasn\u2019t, but that boy, he was somebody\u2019s son, too.\u201d"}
