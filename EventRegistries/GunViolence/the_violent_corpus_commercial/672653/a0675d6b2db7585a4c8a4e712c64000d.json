A group of kids were also part of the crowd when out of nowhere several gunshots rang out. One of the bullets struck a 9-year-old girl in the back. The shooter then fled the scene.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic. I mean, I don\u2019t know her status right now but still, regardless of what it is, it\u2019s a 9-year-old being shot,\u201d one resident said.\nThe girl was rushed to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. One woman who does not want to be identified said she was shot in this same area six years ago. She said the neighborhood is simply not safe for kids or adults.\n\u201cI am scared for my life,\u201d she said.\nMany are wondering what kids were doing out so late, especially in this area.\n\u201cIn my opinion, no matter where you are, no matter where you live, out past dark is not safe,\u201d a resident said. \u201cEven with parents, without parents, I don\u2019t think anyone should be out this late.\u201d\nNo arrests have been made and police are still investigating the shooting.\nWBZ NewsRadio 1030\u2019s Kim Tunnicliffe reports\nFollow\nFollow Paul on Twitter Paul Burton is a general assignment reporter for WBZ-TV News.
