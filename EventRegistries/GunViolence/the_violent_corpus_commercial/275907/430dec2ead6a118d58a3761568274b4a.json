He reportedly told the boy to set the weapon down, but it went off.\nPolice are investigating the incident. Cardillo said that he had set the gun down when he took off his clothes to shower. He removed the magazine from the pistol, but neglected to clear the bullet in the firing chamber.\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the Center for American Progress and the CDC, Americans are now more likely to die from gunshot injuries than in auto accidents.\nAs cars and driving become safer and safer, the NRA and other pro-gun groups are obstructing any new restrictions on firearms ownership or requirements for safety devices that would make guns less dangerous. As a result, the number of deaths in road accidents continues to steadily decline as the number of gun fatalities inches upward."}
