A large group of patrons were leaving when someone in a light-colored, four-door compact car drove by and opened fire, Sgt. Ryan Hoxmeier said.\nA security guard returned fire, striking the car as it sped away.\nDeputies arrived to find four people suffering from gunshot wounds. They were taken to a hospital for treatment.A fifth person with a gunshot wound was found later at an area hospital, Hoxmeier said.\nThough the victims were shot in the limbs and torso \u2014 and some required surgery \u2014 sheriff\u2019s officials said their injuries were not life-threatening.\nHoxmeier said it appeared there had been some fighting among club patrons earlier in the night and the shooting might have stemmed from that. Though the people who were shot do not appear to have been involved in the fights, he said.\nInvestigators served a search warrant Sunday in the 26500 block of Ethanac Road in Menifee where they found the car used in the shooting.\nAs of Monday morning, no arrests had been made.\nAuthorities ask that anyone with information call investigators at the sheriff\u2019s Perris Station at 951-210-1049."}
