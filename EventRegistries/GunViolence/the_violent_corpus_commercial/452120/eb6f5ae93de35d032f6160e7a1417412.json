Allen Lawrence \u201cLance\u201d Scarsella III, 23, was arrested in Bloomington. Sources said Nathan Gustavsson, 21, of Hermantown, and Daniel Macey, 26, of Pine City, were taken into custody after they turned themselves in. All three suspects are white. Earlier Tuesday, police arrested a 32-year-old Hispanic man in south Minneapolis, but he was later released because, police said, he was not at the scene of the shooting.\nAuthorities are weighing whether to treat Monday\u2019s shooting as a hate crime, according to sources familiar with the investigation.\nIn a video message posted on Facebook, Mayor Betsy Hodges said she \u201cabhors\u201d Monday night\u2019s violence and that \u201cthose attacks have no place in our city.\u201d\nMinneapolis Police Chief Jane\u00e9 Harteau on Twitter called the officers \u201ctrue professionals\u201d and noted that \u201cMPD worked nonstop through the night to bring justice in last night\u2019s shooting.\u201d She did not comment further on the shooting Tuesday.\nThe gunfire erupted around 10:45 p.m. Monday on Morgan Avenue N. about a block north of the precinct station where protesters have staged demonstrations and camped out since Nov. 15, when police fatally shot Jamar Clark, an unarmed 24-year-old black man.\nMiski Noor, a media contact for Black Lives Matter, said \u201ca group of white supremacists showed up at the protest, as they have done most nights.\u201d\nWhen about a dozen protesters attempted to herd the group away from the area, Noor said, they \u201copened fire on about six protesters,\u201d hitting five of them. The victims \u2014 all black men ages 19 through 43 \u2014 were taken to local hospitals. Their injuries were not life threatening.\nIn Minneapolis, protesters gathered Tuesday afternoon outside the Fourth Precinct to reiterate demands for justice in Clark\u2019s death and commit to staying at their encampment.\nOne of the Monday shooting victims returned to the scene, leaning heavily on a cane. Wesley Martin said he was shot after he and a group of others chased the suspected gunmen toward an alley off Morgan Avenue.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out here every night since it started, and you know when people look suspicious,\u201d Martin said.\nThe bullet ripped through his right knee, Martin said. He said his 19-year-old friend Teven King was also shot, in the stomach.\nAs Martin spoke, his cousin Leroy Williams nodded in agreement. Williams said one of Clark\u2019s nephews, Cameron Clark, 24, was among the shooting victims.\nBy 3 p.m., a crowd of about 1,000 marchers with banners headed to City Hall, pausing at Clark\u2019s makeshift memorial on Plymouth Avenue along the way.\nThe shooting appeared to draw new supporters to the cause.\nFelicia Washington Sy, a psychotherapist, said she left work early Tuesday afternoon, telling her boss, \u201cI need to be there.\u201d\nIt was the first time Sy had seen the encampment with her own eyes.\n\u201c[I came out] because of the overwhelming feeling of injustice, sadness and my responsibility to take part and say \u2018that\u2019s not OK,\u2019 \u201d she said.\nTwo Minneapolis squad cars guided the group over interstate overpasses and through downtown streets.\nWhen protesters reached City Hall, they continued to N. 4th St., blocking the road in front of the federal courthouse.\nA few protesters attempted to enter the courthouse, but doors were locked.\nCity officials did not come out to meet the crowd, and protesters were told that City Hall was on lockdown.\nAfter rallying in the street for about an hour, the group turned to walk back to the Fourth Precinct station via Washington Avenue.\nMeanwhile, protesters in Chicago also took to the streets after a white police officer was indicted on murder charges in the 2014 shooting death of a 17-year-old black teen. A graphic video released Tuesday shows the officer shooting the teen repeatedly.\nThe FBI, one of the outside agencies investigating Clark\u2019s death, is \u201caware of the incident and is coordinating with the Minneapolis Police Department to assess the facts and determine if further federal action\u201d is warranted, spokesman Kyle Loven said.\nBen Petok, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger\u2019s office, said the attorney\u2019s office and the Department of Justice civil rights division are also taking a look.\nProtesters have raised questions about Minneapolis police officers\u2019 knowledge of and response to the Monday shooting. Asked about those questions Tuesday, Scott Seroka, a police department spokesman, said, \u201cAt this point in the investigation, we know that the people that have been arrested have no connection to the MPD.\u201d\nCouncil President Barb Johnson said the shooting Monday evening was a \u201ccontinuation of a stressful time for the neighbors that live in the area surrounding the Fourth Precinct,\u201d adding that \u201cthey deserve some peace and some rest.\u201d\nJohnson disputed comments that police had taken too long to react to the shooting, and said officers responded in three minutes. She said she believes it\u2019s time for the demonstrations to end, in part because they are attracting attention from outside groups.\nAfter the shooting, Jamar Clark\u2019s brother, Eddie Sutton, urged an end to the encampment, expressing concern for the safety of the protesters. Clark\u2019s funeral is scheduled for Wednesday.\nLt. Bob Kroll, president of the police union, said he is frustrated that the chief allowed protesters to pitch any tents at the North Side precinct building. Instead of patrolling the streets, officers from the precinct have to guard and manually open the gate to a parking lot where the squads and their vehicles are stored.\nThey monitor the encampment from the precinct\u2019s windows and security cameras while several SWAT units are on standby, he said.\nTo backfill, officers from other precincts have to patrol the North Side communities. This takes them away from their own areas and potentially leads to longer response times to 911 calls, he said.\n\u201cThis can only get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cOur officers feel helpless, like they are sitting ducks.\u201d\nAdditional security is in place for City Hall on Wednesday, including additional security guards at entrances and staff being asked to show identification to enter, said Casper Hill, a spokesman for the city. They were also advised that the federal building across the street imposed additional security measures.\nStaff writers Liz Sawyer, Karen Zamora, Natalie Daher and Erin Golden contributed to this report.\nlibor.jany@startribune.com 612-673-4064\ndavid.chanen@startribune.com 612-673-4465"}
