It was gut wrenching when they rolled her little body past us to go to surgery. That\u2019s all I know for now.\nTOPEKA (KSNT) \u2013 Five-year-old Lily Coats-Nichols remains in the hospital on life support Wednesday, as family members deal with a painful decision.\nHer father, Bruce Nichols, tells KSNT News that the doctors say damage from the bullet has likely left her brain dead. It\u2019s news that friends and loved ones are still trying to understand.\n\u201cThe little kid that could. I mean, she was littler than all my kids and she could do everything just as good and she just.. She\u2019s a real good kid,\u201d said Brian McCracken, who lives across the street from Lily\u2019s mother.\n\u201cVery fun to be with. You know she\u2019s high spirit, independent,\u201d said Leroy David McGee Jr., the next door neighbor.\nLily\u2019s 5-year-old friends still don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s happened.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just sleeping,\u201d said 5-year-old Yamilet Marin.\nJust a few days ago they were riding bikes, rolling down hills and petting kittens together.\nNow friends, family and neighbors are trying to cope with the news that the sweet little girl next door is unlikely to come home.\n\u201cIt hurts, it really does, because little girl was only 5 years old. She didn\u2019t deserve that, she didn\u2019t deserve that,\u201d said McGee.\nLily\u2019s father says doctors tell him she\u2019s brain dead and bitterly described their medical options.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just cut the tube basically. Let\u2019s pull it out and get rid of her organs, that\u2019s what basically they made it sound like,\u201d Bruce Nichols said Tuesday.\nAccording to the GoFundMe page created by Lily\u2019s uncle, she will be \u201cblessing many others with life from organs she\u2019s donating.\u201d\n\u201cAnywhere you can give a life, even though one was taken is a great opportunity, even though something bad and tragic happened,\u201d said McCracken.\nNot only that, neighbors say her memory will live on through the lilies she used to pick, and\u2026\n\u201cWhere her spirit is concerned, I think it will live on through these little ones [kittens], because that\u2019s what she was most connected to,\u201d said McGee.\nLily\u2019s aunt tells KSNT News all of Lily\u2019s organs will be donated.\nFor the time being the family is just waiting on recipients and a transplant team to get everything coordinated, but that\u2019s taking a while.\nShe says it\u2019s been horribly hard on the family.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
