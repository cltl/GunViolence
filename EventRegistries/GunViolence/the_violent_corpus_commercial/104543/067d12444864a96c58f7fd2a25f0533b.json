A group of five boys were inside a home \u2013 and one of them pulled out his stepfather\u2019s shotgun from behind the bedroom headboard.\nOne of the boys pumped the shotgun and it fired directly into the chest of 13-year-old Eddie Holmes.\nThe boy was initially arrested and faced a possible manslaughter charge.\nHolmes was a student at Kalles Junior High School and the district brought in extra counselors in February to help students and staff cope with the tragic loss."}
