The boy was unable to tell officers where the shooting occurred, a KPD release stated.\nMoments after the shooting was reported, just before 3:35 p.m., EMS personnel could be seen administering to the teen, who was conscious when EMS personnel loaded him into a waiting ambulance.\nAngie Hernandez, who lives across the street from the home where the shooting took place, said the alley behind the rental home is a hotbed of drug activity.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much going on here at night,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\nShe said the home was burglarized several times in the last year.\n\u201cThis house got broken into by some people about 15 times,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cI was in there checking the house when there was somebody in the garage still. They stole everything out of that house.\u201d\nAs she filled out a police statement, Brandie Coss, who rents the home where police responded to the shooting, said she was in her room when the victim\u2019s friends entered and told her the 15-year-old living at her home had been shot.\n\u201cWe were in my room with the door shut and all three guys just rushed into our room saying he had been shot,\u201d Coss said.\nWiping away tears, she said the victim is practically family.\n\u201cHe lives with us,\u201d Coss said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically my son.\u201d\nCoss said she expected the teen to recover.\nSmith said the shooting is still under investigation."}
