Inside the garage, they found Giaquinta's wife dead; not long later, a man\u2014identified as Giaquinta\u2014opened fire on the officers, wounding both, before fleeing the scene.\n\"As EMS and law enforcement arrived, [Giaquinta] started shooting at Habersham County Sheriff's deputies,\" Georgia State Patrol Capt. Mark Perry told the AJC. \"Two have been wounded. At this point it doesn't appear serious.\"\nSeveral hours after the shooting, Giaquinta and another man were found dead behind the house. It's unclear how both men died.\nAccording to WXIA, Giaquinta was briefly employed by the Habersham sheriff's department in the K9 unit and knew Terrell. Before his job at the sheriff's office, the 41-year-old worked as an officer for the Gainesville Police Department; he was later fired from that job, according to the AJC.\nSheriff Terrell was released from the hospital last night; as of Monday morning, Zigan was still being treated for multiple gunshot wounds, though he's expected to survive."}
