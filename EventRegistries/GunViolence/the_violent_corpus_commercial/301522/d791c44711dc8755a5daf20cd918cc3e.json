His injuries weren\u2019t believed to be life-threatening.\nThe Police Department\u2019s crimes against children unit will investigate, Segura said. If necessary, it will consult with Child Protective Services to see if there was any negligence by the parents, he said.\n\u201cIf the children intentionally went into a secured safe and got [the gun] out and started playing with it, that\u2019s a different story,\u201d Segura said.\nHe did not say what type of gun it was.\n\u2014 Monica S.
