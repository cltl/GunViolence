Police did not release the identity of the 9-year-old.\n\"I can't fathom what the parents are going through. I don't understand the gun violence because in the contract for leasing, there shouldn't be any guns on the premises. Two, why wasn't the gun locked up? Three, where were the parents at, and four, why would a child give another child a gun,\" neighbor Bree Tucker said.\nAttorney Guy Relford is an expert in gun law and a certified firearms instructor.\n\"Locking up our guns isn't just about the safety of children, although that's paramount. It's for our safety too. Because the bad guy breaks into your house, you have an unsecured firearm, you've just empowered a burglar, you potentially have changed a burglar into a murderer by providing them with a weapon,\" Relford said.\nThe shooting is under investigation as a homicide by the Marion County Coroner\u2019s Office.\nThe victim's parents could face criminal charges.\nDetectives asked anyone with information about this incident to call Crime Stoppers at 317|262.TIPS (8477).
