He was pronounced dead at the scene.\nTaylor was killed about two weeks after his birthday.\n\u201cClasses done for the day thank goodness now to go home and relax for the day/weekend,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page on Thursday.\nFort Myers police have not released the names and conditions of the other victims. Four were treated and released from Lee Memorial Hospital with non-life threatening injuries and a fifth refused medical treatment.\nNo suspect information was immediately available.\nFrom festive to chaos\nAbout 20,000 people were estimated at Saturday\u2019s event, which was so packed that attendees stood shoulder to shoulder.\nAnd then shots rang out.\n\u201cI just heard about 5, 6 shots,\u201d said Jose Mendez, who was walking near Taylor when the shots were fired. \u201cWhen I looked, I saw the guy fall down. I stayed right there and then his brother started jumping on top of him crying and crying and screaming and stuff like that.\u201d\nOne cell phone video captured four gunshots. Another recorded attendees running through downtown after the shots were fired.\n\u201cThere\u2019s blood everywhere,\u201d one person said in a third video.\nThat video also captured a man grieving over a body lying on the sidewalk. After being pulled away from the body, the man was then consoled by an unidentified woman.\nThe Halloween-like atmosphere, with patrons wearing costumes with fake bloody injuries and carrying fake weapons, made it difficult for law enforcement to tell the injured from the non-injured, said James Didio, who was handing out bottles of water at the event when he heard four shots.\n\u201cA male walked over to me\u2026and he asked me if he was shot,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked down and his legs had multiple wounds at which point I asked him to have a seat, let\u2019s get medics to come over.\u201d\nDon Small, who works at Capone\u2019s Coal Fired Pizza, said the event quickly went from festive to chaotic.\n\u201cIt was like total mayhem then,\u201d he said. \u201cLittle kids almost getting trampled. You know, people coming around trying to jump over a very hot grill\u2026stove. We\u2019re pushing people inside the restaurant and you know, take cover, because we didn\u2019t know which way the person was running. If he was running back around, if they had snatched him.\u201d\nInvestigators have not said what led to the shootings.\nBringing happiness to others\nDespite losing both parents, his grandmother and an unborn child within the last two years, Taylor was able to draw smiles out of others.\n\u201cHe always had that mentality to make everybody laugh,\u201d said his uncle, Efram Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard pill to swallow. You never want to bury a child. You never want to bury a sibling at all, period. Especially when they try to do everything that\u2019s right. You don\u2019t understand why somebody would do something like this.\u201d\nTaylor turned to football, where he caught the eye of coaches at ASA College. Out of 175 players that attended an open tryout, Taylor was one of six who made the cut, head coach Ernest Jones said.\n\u201cWhat I most remember about him is that he had a lot of energy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe never got tired. He said \u2018I can run 16 more, I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do. I want to be part of this team.\u2019 So as coaches we\u2019re like \u2018Who\u2019s this kid? Where did he come from?'\u201d\nTaylor was planning to visit family after stopping in Fort Myers. Now relatives, who were returning from burying a loved one, are planning his funeral.\n\u201cI\u2019m still hurting for him cause of what he went through, and he still managed to make the best out of life,\u201d Washington said. \u201c\u2018Cause he put the right people in his life. And he tried to do what\u2019s right, he did what\u2019s right. But you know, you can do everything right, and at the spare of a moment\u2026\u201d\nOrganizers, leaders react\nEvent organizers posted a statement on Zombicon\u2019s Facebook page, saying they were \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the shootings.\n\u201cWe take the safety of our patrons very seriously and take precautions in hiring security and police officers for our annual event,\u201d they said. \u201cOur prayers go out to the family members and individuals involved in the incident.\u201d\nShootings at large outdoor events with public access are hard to prevent, Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott said.\n\u201cAny loss of life is tragic and yet we see it all over the country from churches to schools to movie theaters and most anywhere people gather,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cLast night\u2019s incident with 20,000 plus people is near impossible to predict or prevent.\u201d\nAuthorities hope video and pictures from attendees will help lead to an arrest.\n\u201cThese random acts of violence will be deterred and ultimately eradicated through the deployment of cameras, arrest, and successful prosecution of the perpetrators,\u201d Fort Myers Mayor Randall Henderson said in a statement. \u201cI want to thank all citizens who have shown bravery and resolve in assisting law enforcement through their capturing of these heinous acts with personal cameras and testimony. With everyone pulling in the same direction we will solve this problem.\u201d\nSmall, the pizza shop employee, believes Saturday\u2019s shooting will negatively impact future Zombicon events.\n\u201cI think this person has no idea what he did for this event and how it may have hurt upcoming events in the future,\u201d he said.\nAnyone with information about the shootings, including photos or cell phone video taken around the time of the shooting, is asked to contact Fort Myers police at (239) 321-7700 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-780-TIPS."}
