(KNOE 8 News) - Two people are recovering from gunshot wounds after a home invasion in Monroe early Sunday morning on Harn Street.\nMonroe Police say they got a call around four Sunday morning, after two suspects walked in the front door of the home and shot at a 23-year old, standing near the home's hallway. They say the suspects walked into a bedroom and confronted a 16-year old with a .22 rifle and shotgun. Police say the 23-year old shielded the teen as the two suspects began shooting at them, hitting the teen in the leg and the 23-year old in the arm before fleeing the home.\n\"It was a shock it really was, this is a peaceful neighborhood. I've lived here for four years, I love it here all my neighbors are good people pretty much 95 percent of us are gun owners and know how to use them,\" says neighbor Jason Aycock.\nHe says he spoke with their father who says the 16-year-old is still in the hospital and they don't have life threatening injuries.\nMonroe Police say nothing was reported stolen. Police say they did not appear to have life-threatening injuries, but its unclear if they were airlifted to the hospital.\nMonroe Police are still investigating, but say they believe the victims knew the suspects previously and were targeted."}
