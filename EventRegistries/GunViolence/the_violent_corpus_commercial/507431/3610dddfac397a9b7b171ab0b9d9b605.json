Steven Giannini.\nHe said Lago accidentally shot the victim, a 16-year-old boy, at 31 Beech St. at about 1:30 p.m. with a rifle that was recovered by police.\nThe teenager, said Giannini, was released from a local hospital after being treated for the minor wound.\n\"They were just hanging out and handling the weapon\" when it went off, said Giannini, who added that police believe the age and condition of the rifle may have contributed to it going off.\nIn addition to Lago being arrested, Rodolfo Mercado, 22, who lives at 31 Beech St., was cited for the felonious misleading of a police investigation.\nGiannini said Mercado was not arrested but has been summonsed to court to hear the single charge.\nLago's bail information was not immediately available."}
