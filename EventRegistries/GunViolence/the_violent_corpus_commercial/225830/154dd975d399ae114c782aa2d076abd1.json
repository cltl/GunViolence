The 19-year-old victim is in critical condition. The 24-year-old victim was shot in the leg; she is in non-critical condition.\nAn 18-year-old victim was driven to the hospital by someone who was on the scene. A fourth victim was driven to Methodist University Hospital. He was shot in the arm and listed in non-critical condition.\nAccording to investigators, the shots were fired into a crowd from someone in a white car.\nKeto Brown was in his hotel room, not too far from the crime scene.\n\"I did hear the gunshots in the hotel, but I didn't think nothing of it because in this area, it's like that sometimes,\" he said.\nRandy Williams, who is the club's Promoter, said the shooting happened next door rather than on their property.\n\"There was no problem inside the club. No shooting on this parking lot,\" he said. \"Everything went good for the night.\"\nThe Thanksgiving Day shooting is not the first time Pure Passion has been in the news. In 2008, Shelby County District Attorney's Office shut the club down for illegal drug use and drug sales following a 4-month-long investigation.\nThe club eventually reopened.\nMost recently, in April 2014, a 25-year-old man was killed and another was rushed to the hospital after witnesses told police someone opened fire into their car.\n\"There has been a few problems before, but recently we haven't had any problems at all,\" Williams added.\nIf you have any information about the shooting that sent four people to hospitals, call Crime Stoppers at 901-528-CASH.\nCopyright 2014 WMC Action News 5.
