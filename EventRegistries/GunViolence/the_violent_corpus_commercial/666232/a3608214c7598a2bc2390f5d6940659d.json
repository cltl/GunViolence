They were from Beaver. And the driver, we are still attempting to make contact with him. We believe he also was from Beaver,\u201d Aliquippa Police Chief Don Couch said.\nThe 13-year-old passenger in the vehicle ran to a nearby home to seek help for the victim.\nAliquippa Police spent several hours collecting ballistic evidence Thursday night. They\u2019re not sure exactly how many shots were fired.\nFriday morning, police were back out on the street trying to piece together what happened. They say they\u2019re also collecting surveillance video from nearby.\n\u201cWe generally don\u2019t have too many problems on that street. It\u2019s unfortunate and like I said, it\u2019s just a tragedy and we\u2019re investigating to the fullest extent,\u201d Couch said.\nAt this time, no one is in custody and there is no word on what prompted the shooting.\nStay with KDKA for the latest on this developing story."}
