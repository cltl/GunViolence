Another occupant was lying in the road with a leg wound.\nA Ford Edge was crashed near the ball field, with the doors open and spent shell casings inside. Officers said they found a rifle and a pistol the occupants dropped as they fled.\nInvestigators say it started when Gilliard and three other men in the Ford spotted the Charger at the Cheapway gas station on Dorchester Road and decided to exact retaliation on one of the occupants. They followed the Charger and opened fire with a rifle as it approached Park Circle, according to the arrest affidavit. Further details about the alleged motive have not been publicly released.\nGilliard is accused of fatally shooting Franklin Williams and wounding Adrian Williams, 25, of North Charleston; Quran Allen, 24, of Harleyville; and Montez Capers, age and address not given.\nGilliard was arrested without incident about 7:40 p.m. Monday at his apartment on St. Philip Street, according to the incident report.
