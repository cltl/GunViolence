Nightclub", "dct": "Mon, 28 Jan 2013 10:00:00 GMT", "id": "58be18730b1e4e53495ce6c8118ba40d", "content": "Five people were wounded when gunfire broke out early Saturday morning at a nightclub in the Carver-Langston section of Northeast D.C. One woman and four men at DC Soundstage, a venue at 2403 Benning Road NE, suffered non-life-threatening injuries when shots were fired about 2:30 a.m., D.C. police said.\nThe Washington Post reports the shooting began shortly after a physical altercation in which one participant briefly left the club and returned a short while later and opened fire. The Post also writes that DC Soundstage was serving alcohol using a caterer's license. The venue does not appear on the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration's most current list of license holders; it was said to be serving alcohol on a caterers license. DC Soundstage has been open for about a year, though efforts to reach its managers or owners were unsuccessful.\nOfficer Tisha Gant, a Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman, tells DCist there have been no arrests so far and that investigators are still developing a profile of the suspected gunman. Late Saturday afternoon police ordered the club closed for 96 hours, as often happens after violent incidents."}
