He said grief counselors will be at the school all week while teachers try to keep a normal routine.\n\"So that on top of their having to process this loss, they don't also have to figure out why they didn't get to go to gym today or missed art class,\" he said.\nMcGee said it's important for parents to listen to their children.\n\"You don't know what they're thinking and to give your kids a chance to talk,\" he said. \"Another is to recognize that they're going to hear things and know things.\"\nInvestigators wouldn't say exactly when the shootings happened.\nThey said they're waiting to hear more from the medical examiner before releasing more information."}
