The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.\nIt was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.\nIn what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday\u2019s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.\nThe woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he \u201cbecame physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.\u201d\n\u201cHe placed me in a choke hold from behind \u2013 I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. \u201cHe then got me to the ground while choking me.\u201d Eventually, she says, he let her go.\nA Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman\u2019s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person \u201cbattering her leaving visible injuries.\u201d\nPolice categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.\nIn her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford\u2019s demeanor and mental state.\n\u201cHe is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,\u201d she writes, again all in capital letters. \u201cIt\u2019s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!\u201d\nNext to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: \u201che\u2019s moving out.\u201d\nThe wounded\nVia Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.\nWichita\u2019s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.\nNewton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.\nNewton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.\nWalton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter\u2019s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.\nLate Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.\nInside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver\u2019s door of the pickup stood wide open.\nExcel Industries, 200 S.
