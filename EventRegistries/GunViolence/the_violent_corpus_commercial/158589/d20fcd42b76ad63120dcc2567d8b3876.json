Latoya Williams and Jean Prosper sustained other injuries during the conflict, authorities said.\nAccording to Stamford Mayor David Martin, Tino's owner agreed to voluntarily shutter the club and forfeit its liquor license. Signs will come down tomorrow, and the clubs will no longer hold promoted private parties.\nTino's will likely reopen under a new name, but Martin said the kind of behavior that took place over the weekend \"will not be tolerated\" and the city will increase its police presence at upcoming events.\nMartin said the agreement comes as the result of a meeting among area restaurant owners, public safety officials and officials from the Stamford Downtown Special Services District, a local non-profit responsible for managing and promoting the city's downtown area.\nWills appeared in court Monday. His attorney claims Wills acted in self defense, but the states attorney called him a \"serious risk to the community.\"\nPolice released video footage that a witness took of the shooting and are asking for other witnesses to come forward with information.\nThe video shows a man in a red shirt, who police say is Wills, pulling a gun out in a crowded parking lot and several people ducking for cover as the man fired successive shots. Witnesses posted the video on social media and police have the footage in evidence, police said.\nWills pulled his gun on another person he got into an altercation with and fired shots at the individual, he told police.\nPolice received reports of a shooting at about 1:38 a.m. July 13. Responding officers heard gunshots being fired as they arrived at what they described as a \"chaotic scene\" and discovered five people who were shot.\nFour men and one woman were taken to an area hospital to be treated for gunshot wounds \"to their upper and lower extremities,\" police said. The injuries appear to be non-life threatening, police said.\nIt's not clear whether the person Wills got into a dispute with was one of the wounded or one of the people in the video, police said. The shooting remains under investigation.\nWills told police he discarded his .40-caliber handgun near the Atlantic Street and Bank Street intersection, which was where people found it. Police said that Wills has a valid pistol permit and that he is legally registered to carry the gun that was used in the shooting.\nWhen police found Wills, they also seized \"a small amount of marijuana\" that he had on him.\nStamford police charged Wills with five counts of first-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, unlawful discharge of a firearm and possession of marijuana.\nPolice held him on a $1 million bond. When Wills appeared in Stamford Superior Court on Monday, his attorney asked the judge to delay setting bond, but the judge denied the request and kept bond at $1 million.\nStamford police notified the State's Attorney's Office about the incident.\nThe Stamford Police Department said that there were several witnesses to the shooting and are asking for the public's help in the investigation. Anyone with information should call the Stamford Police Detective Bureau at 203-977-4417."}
