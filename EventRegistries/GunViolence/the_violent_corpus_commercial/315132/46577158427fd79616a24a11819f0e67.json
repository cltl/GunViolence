According to Barrow County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Capt. Matt Guthas, Lewis shot his girlfriend\u2019s young daughter in the side Monday while inside their mobile home on Ga. 82.\nThe girl, Guthas said, has since undergone several surgeries and remained in critical condition Thursday.\n\u201cLewis was playing with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol in front of (his girlfriend\u2019s) three children,\u201d Guthas said in a news release. \u201cInvestigators learned that Lewis was \u2018racing\u2019 as he dismantled the firearm and then reassembled it. He even asked the children to \u2018time\u2019 him out loud to see how fast he was.\u201d\n\u201cLewis did this several times before eventually pulling the trigger on a loaded handgun while the 9-year-old victim sat next to him.\u201d\nAs of Thursday, Lewis was being held at the Barrow County Detention Center without bond. The drug charges against him stem from \u201cevidence uncovered at the scene during the search warrant,\u201d Guthas said."}
