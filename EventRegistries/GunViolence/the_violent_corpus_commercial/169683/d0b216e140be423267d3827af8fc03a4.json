He said it might have been an accidental shooting.\nIt was not immediately clear, either, whether he was shot multiple times, but an autopsy is expected Wednesday morning.\n\u201cIt is just a tragic situation that we have a young person who has been killed this morning,\u201d Miley said Tuesday.\nWitnesses at the house reported hearing gunfire.\n\u201cNot multiple shots, from what I understand, there was just one shot heard,\u201d said Lt. Randy Gonzalez, a public information officer for the Bibb County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cWe\u2019re not ruling anything out right now. Investigators are still talking with witnesses. When you have a situation like this, you look at all avenues.\u201d\nA Bibb County crime scene technician gathered evidence inside the house, which was roped off with yellow tape.\nCoroner Leon Jones said Felder was pronounced dead about 4:45 a.m.\nThe Southwest High School principal was notified about the death, according to officers at the scene. Bibb County schools spokeswoman Stephanie Hartley said Felder had attended Southwest High but was not enrolled there this year.\nAbout 6:20 a.m., students in Felder\u2019s neighborhood emerged from homes to head to the bus stop on Nisbet Drive.\nOne girl with tears welling in her eyes clutched a binder as the students silently walked up the street.\nWhen asked if the teens knew Antrez, one of the young men nodded, but they were too upset to talk about what happened.\nCounselors are available at the high school for any students who want to discuss their feelings about Felder\u2019s death, Hartley said.\n\u201cHe was a mannerable boy,\u201d said Felder\u2019s aunt, Stephine Colson.\nShe said he hoped to go into the military.\n\u201cHe was trying to finish school,\u201d Colson said. \u201cHe was good in school. He didn\u2019t act up.\u201d\nFelder, known to friends as \u201cGQ,\u201d enjoyed \u201cmaking people laugh all the time,\u201d Colson said. \u201cHe had plenty of friends. ... What happened really was an accident.\u201d\nTo contact writer Liz Fabian, call 744-4303."}
