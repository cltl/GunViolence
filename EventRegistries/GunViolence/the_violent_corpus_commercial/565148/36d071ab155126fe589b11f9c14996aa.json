(WPDE) \u2014\nA 14-year-old boy was shot Tuesday evening as he tried to take a gun away from a 10-year-old girl in a wooded area off of Mill Street in Bennettsville, according to Lt. Larry Turner with Bennettsville police.\nTurner said the gun belonged to the 10-year-old's father, and the girl got it from inside a drawer at their home.\nHe added the two were playing with the gun at first, when for some reason the girl started pointing it at the teenager.\nThat's when he tried to take it from her, Turner said, and it went off, shooting the boy in the hand.\nHe added the 14-year-old's mother took the boy to the hospital in Cheraw thinking he had been shot with a BB gun.\nTurner said hospital officials called them saying the boy had been wounded with a real gun.\nPolice plan to consult with the Fourth Circuit Solicitor's Office to determine what, if any charges will be filed in this investigation.\nThe 14-year-old is expected to be okay."}
