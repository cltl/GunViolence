It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney.\nHundreds of students released balloons Monday in memory of 15-year-old Armoni Sexton days after the basketball star was gunned down in a drive-by shooting in New Jersey. A candlelight memorial also stands by the spot where the shooting occurred.\nSchool officials said Sexton, who already stood at an impressive 6 feet 7 inches, was not only a star player, but a role model to other students.\n\u201cI will remember him as a kid who really, really tried both on and off the court and who served as an example to everyone else at Paterson Charter School,\u201d said Dean of Students James Bacote.\nSexton was among the top basketball players in his age group in the country. Just 10 days ago, his team the NJ Playas won a National Championship in Virginia, and the team has another national tournament this week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rough, really rough,\u201d said coach Kiela Brevard. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t want us to sit around, he would want us to play this weekend.\u201d\nBrevard, who said he started coaching Sexton when he was 12 years old, had a dream to go to college and one day buy his mother a home.\n\u201cHe was a good child, always tried to do right,\u201d said his great-grandmother Marie Jacobs.\nHis coach says he will always be a part of the team.\n\u201cHe will be with us at every tournament we go, every practice we are at. He\u2019s with us when we go to sleep, when we wake up. He\u2019s here with us right now,\u201d Brevard said.\nAnyone with additional information on the shooting is asked to call Paterson Police at 973-321-1120 or to send a text via PatersonPD.com."}
