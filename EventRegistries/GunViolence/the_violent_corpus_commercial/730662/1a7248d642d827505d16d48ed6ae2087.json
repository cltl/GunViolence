He was life-flighted with serious injuries and the case is still being investigated. It was reported as an accidental shooting. So far, everything is consistent with that.\u201d\nGallia 911 Center incident report listings state the victim was reportedly shot in the back and the teenagers had believed the firearm to be empty upon its discovery. The specific circumstances as to how the firearm was discharged are still being investigated. Relatives reported the emergency.\n\u201cIt is a really bad thing,\u201d said Browning. \u201cWe hope that he\u2019s okay and makes a full recovery. Parents should always take the time, especially around the holidays, to talk to youth and teens about gun safety. If they\u2019re in your home, you should take that extra step and talk to other family members about safety aspects if they should happen to find (a gun) on a shelf or somewhere. Always treat it as if it\u2019s loaded. If they don\u2019t know what to do with it or safe operation, they should always contact a responsible adult when they find a gun.\u201d\nAccording to Browning, accidental shootings become more frequent during the holiday season.\nThe Gallia Sheriff\u2019s Office has engaged in the Eddie Eagle program since 2009. Deputies have visited with schools and youth groups in an attempt to stress the importance of gun safety. The National Rifle Association program is nationally known for its safety slogan \u201cStop. Don\u2019t touch. Leave the area. Tell an adult.\u201d\nDean Wright can be reached at 740-446-2342, ext. 2103."}
