That led to an altercation, and police said the suspect began hitting Bumpas in the head with a flashlight.\nA backup officer tried to use a Taser on the suspect but it had no effect, according to police, so he drew his gun and fired shots. The suspect was hit and Bumpas was also struck in the abdomen.\nWPD said Bumpas underwent surgery at John Peter Smith Hospital and is recovering well. He has already been released so he can heal at home.\nThe suspect is still recovering in the hospital. Once released, he will be taken to the Parker County Jail and charged with his original warrant, as well as aggravated assault of a peace officer.\nThe officer who fired the shots has been placed on administrative leave, a standard procedure for officers involved in shootings.\nOfficer Bumpas has been with WPD for one year and was awarded Rookie of the Year, according to the department's Facebook page.\nChief Mike Manning released the following statement:\n\u201cWe are ecstatic that Officer Bumpas has been released from the hospital and allowed to go home to recover along-side his family.
