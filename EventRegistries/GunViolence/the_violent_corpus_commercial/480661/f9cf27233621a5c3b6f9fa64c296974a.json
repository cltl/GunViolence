Four people were hit and one of them, 21-year-old Randy Lee Jones, did not survive.\nHe was not the only victim of this weekend's violence.\nSee also: Deandre Thomas: Man Killed in North St. Louis Alleyway, Suspect At Large (Homicide No. 74)\nA witness told police he heard arguing just before the shooting. The surviving victims say they only heard shots but never saw anyone. Jones was shot in the chest, thigh, buttocks and abdomen, and doctors pronounced him dead at a local hospital. A 36-year-old man was in critical/stable condition after being hit in the abdomen and back. A 22-year-old woman who was also caught in the gunfire was shot in the back and a 33-year-old male victim was shot in the calf and shoulder. Both are in stable condition. There does not seem to be an arrest at this point and the investigation is \"ongoing.\"\nLast night, around 8 p.m., another young man was gunned down on the 8600 block of Park Lane, also in North St. Louis. According to police, the man was \"in his 20's\" and was shot in the head. Details are scant at this point and we will update when we know more, but this will count as the city's 76th homicide in 2013.\nSee also: Carnez Winslett Shot Dead at His Birthday Party; Darnell Hollings Arrested (Homicide 72)\nAnd those were just the deaths.
