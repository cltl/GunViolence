(NEWSCHANNEL 3) - A 17-year-old is in critical condition in the hospital after authorities say her 15-year-old cousin accidentally shot her in the chest.\nNewschannel 3 was in court for the young suspect's preliminary hearing Thursday.\nAuthorities say the teen stole a handgun from his grandfather sometime over the last few days, and accidentally shot a 17-year-old with it, leaving her critically injured.\nThe 15-year-old boy walked into court Thursday in handcuffs. He faces multiple charges--including stealing a gun, and careless discharge causing injury or death.\n\"But not willfully or wantingly, cause or allow a certain firearm under his immediate control--to wit a handgun--to be discharged to harm or kill another person,\" explained Denise Noble, with Kalamazoo Family Court, laying out the charges.\nAuthorities say the 15-year-old accidentally shot the girl in the chest. The 17-year-old girl is in critical condition at Borgess.\nHis parents turned him in after the shooting happened yesterday at the Country Meadows Apartment complex on Sunnyside Drive, in Kalamazoo Township, and were in court Thursday.\n\"I would never let my son run,\" said the boy's mother. \"What he did with my dad's firearm was wrong. That's my niece that it happened to; they're family.\"\nThe boy's mother pleaded with Kalamazoo Family Court to release her son into her custody.\n\"I just want my boy home. He will be there. My right hand to God my son will be there. Just let my boy come home with me please. I'm begging you,\" she said.\nBut the court decided to hold him on $30,000 bond.\n\"It's a violent offense. Because you did in fact steal a firearm and receive or conceal that stolen firearm that resulted in this injury,\" Noble said. \"And let's just hope that it remains an injury and not a death.\"\nThe teen is expected back in court Friday, when it will be decided if he will be charged as an adult."}
