LOUIS (KMOX) \u2013 Three armed men walked into a south St. Louis bar late Tuesday hoping to pull off a robbery. Instead, they touched off a shootout that resulted in a total of six people getting shot, including two suspects.\nIt all started just before 11 p.m. Tuesday at Pooh\u2019s Corner on Virginia Avenue near Fillmore in the shadow of Interstate 55.\nReports say it\u2019s a place frequented by off-duty police officers.\nCapt. Michael Sack says three men wearing red bandanas over their faces walked into the bar.\n\u201cThat lead suspect fired a shot into the ceiling and announced a robbery,\u201d Sack says. \u201cIt was right about that time that gunfire erupted from all of them. One of the patrons, apparently, at the far end of the bar armed with a revolver, fired a shot that struck that lead suspect in the left eye.\u201d\nHe says the 65-year-old bar patron who fired upon the robbers was a police officer in the 1970s, and he has a concealed-carry permit.\nA 63-year-old woman was critically injured when she was struck in the back of the head.\nA second suspect turned up later at a local hospital seeking treatment.\nThe third robber remains at large, reportedly driving a blue Dodge Magnum.\nThis story was updated at 1:43 p.m.\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
