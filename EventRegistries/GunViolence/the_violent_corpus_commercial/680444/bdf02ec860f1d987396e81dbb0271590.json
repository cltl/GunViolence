The man, described as Garcia\u2019s relative, was hit in the foot and is expected to survive.\nA motive for the attack has not been released, but a source familiar with the investigation told this newspaper that one or both of the suspects yelled out gang slogans during the attack. Family members said neither Garcia nor the male relative has any gang affiliations.\nThe shooting left Garcia\u2019s survivors searching for answers.\n\u201cShe was a good person and a great mother, and very loved,\u201d said a cousin who asked not to be named out of safety concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair that they took her life from us. She was an innocent bystander.\u201d\nThe cousin also lamented how Garcia was victimized right in front of her home.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be safe in our own homes?\u201d she said.\nThe death marked the city\u2019s 40th homicide of the year, a total that is well ahead of the 30 recorded in San Jose in 2015.\nThe 39th homicide occurred Wednesday evening in the area of Dove Hill Park near Ravens Place Way and Muir Place. Police were alerted to the shooting only after two male victims showed up at a hospital.\nOne of the victims in that case, 17-year-old Umberto Salas of San Jose, came in suffering from a gunshot wound and died at the hospital. The second victim, an adult male, was not shot.\nThe surviving victim reportedly told police that he and Salas were sitting in a parked car near the park when two unknown suspects walked up to the vehicle and tried to rob them. He said he was assaulted and that Salas was shot, and that the attackers fled.\nAnyone with information about these cases can contact the San Jose Police Department homicide unit at 408-277-5283. Tips about Garcia\u2019s case should be directed to Detective Sgt. Pat Guire or Detective Todd Jennings, and tips about Salas\u2019 case should be directed to Guire or Detective Raul Martinez.
