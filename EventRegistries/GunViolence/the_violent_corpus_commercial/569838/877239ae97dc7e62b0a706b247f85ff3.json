(WSVN) \u2014 A teenage boy was taken into custody in connection to a shooting inside a Pembroke Pines home that left a 15-year-old boy with a gunshot wound to the head, according to police, Wednesday.\nAccording to Pembroke Pines Police, the victim was shot on the 8200 block of Northwest 10th Street, just after 12:30 p.m.\nThe teen was transported via ground rescue to Joe DiMaggio Children\u2019s Hospital in Hollywood. According to officials, he was conscious and alert during transport.\nOfficials said there was no exit wound in the victim\u2019s head, so it remains unclear whether the teen was shot or grazed.\nOfficials said the teen is alive. He is in guarded condition, and may have sustained skull fractures.\nArea residents said this is a quiet neighborhood, and they are surprised by the shooting. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything,\u201d said a man who lives near the home, where the shooting took place. \u201cFrom what I gathered, there were some shots fired, but I was in my house, and the shots were inside that house, so I didn\u2019t hear nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI live a few houses east of the ruckus, and I came outside and saw a barricade and a big truck, and it kind of freaked me out,\u201d said Netta Nicosia.\nPolice are attempting to determine the circumstances behind the shooting and where the teens may have gotten the gun. Detectives are interviewing the 16-year-old teen who was taken into custody.\n\u201cI believe that schools should start teaching gun safety,\u201d said Nicosia. \u201cI mean, if they\u2019re gonna teach sex education, why can\u2019t they teach gun safety instead of having all these accidents?\u201d\nNeighbors said the family who lives in the home where the shooting took place had recently moved into that residence and described them as nice, hardworking people. Officials have not disclosed the teens\u2019 identities, and it remains unknown whether police have been able to notify the victim\u2019s parents.\nCopyright 2017 Sunbeam Television Corp.
