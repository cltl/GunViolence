Ken Cha, 19, was arrested Friday morning in Sacramento. Vue, 16, was arrested shortly after the shooting and had an upcoming trial date.\nThey face first-degree murder, three counts of attempted murder, one count of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling and one count of participating in a criminal street gang, plus other sentencing enhancements.\nDeputy District Attorney Mechele Cook told Judge Julia Scrogin the case against Vue would be dismissed and refiled with the new case naming the two additional defendants.\nVue pleaded not guilty. Scrogin scheduled a Sept. 20 preliminary hearing.\nShe ordered Ryan Cha and Ken Cha back to court on Monday for a continued arraignment.\nSheriff's detectives have said the shooting was an outgrowth of a long-standing feud between two Hmong street gangs.\nRyan Cha's arrest warrant filed in Yuba County Superior Court mentioned a November 2012 fight among 100 gang members during the Hmong New Year celebration. The warrant said Ryan Cha participated in the street battle.\nCONTACT Harold Kruger at 749-4774."}
