Police said the five victims are not believed to have been involved in the actual shooting.\nA second crime scene was located at the intersection of Peyton Ave Bellview Avenue. Police said a total of 64 casings with multiple calibers were recovered from both scenes. Five victims sustained gunshot wounds and were transported to Grady hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\u201c(I heard) like three to four different voices arguing. Then I heard two different female voices. Then it got quiet for a few seconds. Then is sounded like World War III,\u201d Roman Kelly said.\nKelly was parking cars in a lot next door to the club and said from the size of the bullet holes left in a car, and the sound, he thinks one of the guns may have been an automatic assault-style rifle.\nAll of the victims were taken to Grady Memorial Hospital and are reportedly stable.\nThe club has no known surveillance equipment and there are currently no cameras in the immediate area, police said.\n\u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group."}
