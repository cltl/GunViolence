Troy Bankert.\nAround 8:35 p.m., officers found the teen, 17, of York, and Kai Smith, 18, of Felton, at West Philadelphia and North Newberry streets, Bankert said.\nThe teen had been shot in the abdomen, while Smith was shot in the armpit, Bankert said.\nOfficers rendered aid to the teen until EMTs arrived to take him to York Hospital. Smith was taken to York Hospital by private vehicle. Both were taken into surgery, so police did not get a chance to find out what happened, Bankert said.\nNicolas Martinez, an owner of Martinez Grocery & Deli at the corner of West Philadelphia and North Newberry streets, said Monday the teen had just been at the store to pick up some snacks, including a drink. The teen left the store but came back a few minutes later.\n\"Help me, help me,\" the boy told Martinez. \"Call 911. I got shot.\"\nThe teenager had a hole in his abdomen, Martinez said, adding he helped him until first responders arrived.\nMartinez said the teen told him that a man had shot him, but Martinez wasn't sure where the shooting happened.\nHow to help\nAnyone with information on the shootings is asked to call York City Police at 717-846-1234, the detectives division at 717-849-2219 or text \"YORKTIPS\" and your message to 847411 (tip411).\nContact reporter Ted Czech at 717-771-2033."}
