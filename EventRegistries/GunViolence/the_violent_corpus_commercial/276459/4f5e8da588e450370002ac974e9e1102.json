If we can discover that, then we will know if there is another shoe that is going to fall,\u201d Suhr said. \u201cWe need to be out in front of that.\u201d\nAuthorities do not believe the public is in danger in the thriving neighborhood known for its boutiques and popular restaurants.\n\u201cRight now it looks like an all-out assault on these guys,\u201d said Lt. Toney Chaplin of the San Francisco Police Department homicide detail. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pin down\u201d what might have motivated the attack, he said.\nHe said the victims were all adults in their 20s. Officers have stepped up patrols around the area, and the gang task force is joining SFPD\u2019s Northern Station to saturate the area.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely making sure there is a high presence out there, a high visibility,\u201d Chaplin said.\nThe victims were found shot at about 10 p.m. in a stolen black 2005 Honda that was double-parked near the corner of Laguna and Page streets, police said. All four men died at the scene.\nWhile Suhr said police know the identity of the victims, their names were not immediately released. One victim was identified Saturday by his aunt, Kim Barnett, who drove to San Francisco from near Sacramento to view the scene of the crime Saturday.\nShe said her nephew was Manuel O\u2019Neal, who was in his early 20s. She insisted he wasn\u2019t in a gang. \u201cHe was a very good kid, very intelligent, smart and caring,\u201d she said. \u201cIt hurts. He traveled the whole country with my family.\u201d\nBarnett said O\u2019Neal has been in and out of school in recent months and traveled from the Sacramento area to visit his mother in San Francisco.\nOne resident, who did not want to be named but said he watched police perform CPR on the victims late Friday, said, \u201cIt was very surreal to watch.\u201d\nHe said he heard police telling one of the victims, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to help you. Let us help you.\u201d\nSusan O\u2019Connell was in bed and was startled by the sound of gunfire.\n\u201cI heard what sounded like grenades go off,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been that close to gunfire.\u201d\nLate Friday, yellow tarps covered the bodies of the victims around the sedan parked on Laguna Street near the curb, pointed toward Market Street. The car still had its amber lights and taillights on. Yellow evidence markers were strewn around the car.\nSuhr said four guns were likely involved in the massacre, with two guns found inside the stolen car with the victims.\nTwo different calibers of shell casings were recovered on the ground near the car, and multiple shots were fired, he added.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got four victims in a car here,\u201d one of the first officers who arrived at the scene said on the police radio. \u201cWe\u2019ve got multiple gunshot wounds here,\u201d another officer reported.\nAfter dispatchers asked whether it was safe for paramedics to enter the area, an officer responded, \u201cIt is clear for them to come in. Get them in here quick, please.\u201d\nNo arrests have been made. San Francisco police described a possible suspect vehicle as a newer-model silver Scion that could have been heading toward Highway 101. California Highway Patrol officers were alerted.\nPolice are also searching for any street surveillance video that might have caught either the attack or the fleeing car.\nResidents who called 911 reported hearing as many as 15 shots. The gunfire was also captured by ShotSpotter, the city\u2019s gunfire-detection system. Bullets hit at least one parked car.\n\u201cWe thought it was firecrackers at first, but then we heard the police,\u201d said neighbor Robin Levitt, 62.\nOn Saturday morning, Victoria Austin, 61, a priest at the nearby San Francisco Zen Center, put up a memorial on a post that said, \u201c1/9/15/ drive-by 4 people rest in peace,\u201d with flowers attached.\n\u201cI was awakened by sounds, saw the flashing lights,\u201d she said. \u201cI had hoped violence and the causes of violence in the neighborhood were done. It\u2019s not over. It\u2019s a shock to everyone.\u201d\nOfficers cordoned off several blocks with yellow crime scene tape and canvassed the neighborhood for witnesses. Neighbors gathered at the tape, hoping the four victims were not their loved ones.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make sure everybody\u2019s kids are OK,\u201d said a woman who asked to be identified only as Toni. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to get that phone call.\u201d\nOn Saturday morning, news of the killings was reverberating through the busy shopping district along Hayes Street, three blocks north of the crime scene. Shoppers dipped into clothing stores while dozens waited in line for brunch at the district\u2019s many restaurants.\nDonald Simms, 47, manager of the men\u2019s clothing store Sean, said, \u201cRandom violence can happen anywhere. It doesn\u2019t affect my perception of the neighborhood.\u201d\nThe killings added to a grim start to the new year in San Francisco, which reported 45 homicides in 2014.\nOn Wednesday, a man died after being shot near Candlestick Park. Last Sunday evening, two police sergeants shot and killed a despondent man who allegedly pointed an Airsoft replica gun at them outside SFPD\u2019s Mission Station.\nAuthorities urged anyone with information on the killings to call San Francisco police at (415) 575-4444 or text a tip to TIP411 with \u201cSFPD\u201d at the beginning of the message.\nChronicle staff writers Evan Sernoffsky and Vivan Ho contributed to this report.\nHenry K.
