And I was like, \u2018I'm shot.' So I looked at my shirt and there was a bullet hole going up through my shirt.\"\nPolice say Mary was one of five people shot by 24-year-old Sundra Payne, who started firing. Witnesses say it happened when an argument got out of hand.\n\"Everybody was just running around,\" said Mary. \"A lot of chaos. Everybody running around, running around.\"\nPayne remains on the run.\nMary hopes she will pay for shooting her and the others inside the club, if she is truly the trigger woman.\n\"But whoever she was aiming for was the wrong people. And I feel like I don't deserve that,\" said Mary.\nMary encourages suspect Sundra Payne to turn herself in. Meanwhile, police are asking for anyone with information on Payne's whereabouts to call them.\nTwo of the five victims were taken to hospitals in critical condition.\nSo far, Action News 5's calls to club management have not been returned.\nCopyright 2013 WMC-TV.
