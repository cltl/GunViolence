Royal.\nThe 10-year-old girl asked her brother, also a juvenile, to hold a 12-gauge shotgun that was in the home, Sheriff Royal detailed. As he was trying to make sure the gun was not loaded, it accidentally fired and struck the unidentified victim.\nThe victim's brother ran next door to a neighbor's house where 911 was called.\nOnce deputies arrived, they found the girl, lying on the floor of the living room with a gunshot wound.\nThe deputies immediately began first aid on the victim until Ware County EMS arrived. Life Flight was also requested, but the young girl passed away shortly after the request was made.\nOfficials reported that the victim and her brother were alone in the home while their parents were at work at the time of the shooting.\nDuring the investigation, authorities found that the victim's father, 33-year-old Joshua Scott Jowers, is a convicted felon and he was arrested Sunday for the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\nIn addition to the shotgun, WSO detectives seized several other firearms inside Jowers' home.\nThe investigation is ongoing, but authorities said this shooting has all indications of an unintentional discharge of the shotgun.\nAn autopsy is scheduled for Monday at the GBI Crime Lab in Savannah, GA."}
