Bill Ryan said an investigation into the incident is still ongoing, and an autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday. No charges have been filed in the case, Ryan said.\nPolice confirmed Wehry's identity on Monday after it was reported in The Hummelstown Sun. Wehry's parents also are comfortable with the boy's identity being released, said Ryan, who declined to provide the parents' names.\nRyan declined to comment on further details of the incident.\nAuthorities responded on Jan. 14 to a home in the 200 block of West Main Street in Hummelstown after receiving a report of a male with a gunshot wound. Officers provided emergency medical care until EMS arrived. The Dauphin County coroner's office ultimately pronounced Wehry dead at the scene.\nWehry attended Lower Dauphin School District, which, in a statement released last week, said counselors would be available Monday for families and students if needed.\nNOTE: This post has been updated to correct Caleb Wehry's age when he died."}
