Online records don't list an attorney to speak for the 43-year-old Ratliff, who was arrested Wednesday.\nHouston police questioned Ratliff after the shooting deaths of 44-year-old Sandtrece Ratliff and the couple's daughter, Ariel, with no charges immediately filed. A police statement says Ratliff initially said that his wife and daughter tried to attack him with knives and he was protecting himself.\nPolice on Thursday said evidence at the scene indicated the gunfire was not self-defense. Authorities didn't release details."}
