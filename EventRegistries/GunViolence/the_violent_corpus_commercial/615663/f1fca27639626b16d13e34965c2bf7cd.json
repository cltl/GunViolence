The bullet went into the boy's forehead just below the hairline, traveled under the skin on the crown of his head and then exited without piercing his skull.\nThe boy is expected to recover.\nThe grandparents, deputies said, will not face any charges since their grandson had to make great efforts to the find the key to the locked gun cabinet.\nThe incident came a day after another boy, believed to be 5 years old, shot himself in the face at a home in northwest Harris County.\nThat shooting happened about 6:15 p.m. Tuesday in the 9700 block of Shady Tree Lane, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office. The child was rushed to the Texas Medical Center. He died on Thursday.\nDeputies said the Tuesday shooting also appeared to be accidental and investigators were trying to determine how the boy got his hands on the gun. No charges have been filed yet, but officials said they are unsure if any charges will be pursued.\n\"This very serious,\" a family friend posted in Spanish on Facebook Wednesday. \"They do not give us hope, but I know that we believe and trust in a powerful God who does miracles.\""}
