Hinojos was found dead in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle \u2014 an Acura sedan \u2014 a few blocks away, slumped over and covered in blood, according to court documents.\nAdrian Sandoval, 20, has been charged in the shootout with seven counts of attempted first-degree murder. He also is accused of a crime of violence, a sentencing enhancer.\nProsecutors allege Sandoval fired shots at the Player\u2019s Club security guards out of a passenger-side window. He is due in court for a preliminary hearing Feb. 1 and was being held in lieu of $500,000 bail.\nAccording to an arrest affidavit for Sandoval, he and Hinojos, along with a third man, drove to the strip club after a night of drinking and clubbing in Denver. Witnesses say the trio had been told to leave the property, and the three became upset as they drove off. They returned with a rifle, the affidavit says, opening fire.\nIn the Acura, investigators say they found .22-caliber shell casings and a rifle of the same caliber. The vehicle had several bullet holes, the affidavit says, including one in the right rear passenger-side window.\nSandoval and a third man in the vehicle were apprehended shortly after the shooting by an armed security guard from the strip club, according to the affidavit.\nSponsored Links\n.\nWar Bitz20 Images of Damaged B-17 Bombers That Miraculously Made It HomeWar Bitz\nHome Solar QuotesThinking About Going Solar In 2017?
