(KRQE) \u2013 A man suspected of killing his wife and four daughters in Roswell has been taken into custody in Mexico.\nRoswell Police had been looking for 34-year-old Juan David Villegas-Hernandez since Saturday when he allegedly shot his wife and 3, 7, 11 and 14-year-old daughters.\nPolice confirmed on Monday that Villegas was found in the area of Arizpe, Mexico which is in Sonora. Authorities are now working to get him back in the U.S. to face charges.\nMeanwhile, people who live along Davis Street in Roswell where this happened are in shock.\n\u201cThose little girls were always so happy and always playing all the time,\u201d said John Whann, neighbor.\nThe community is pulling together to raise money for the family. They have set up a GoFundMe page.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just gonna get all that money that we want to raise, we\u2019re gonna get it to this family so they don\u2019t have to worry about nothing but having five beautiful funerals,\u201d said Nicole Vargas, family friend.\nFriends of the family say that Cynthia worked at Eastern New Mexico Medical Center.\nInvestigators say they think it was a domestic dispute that turned deadly, but the motive is yet to be determined.\nA candlelight vigil is scheduled for Saturday evening on the corner of 23rd and Davis.
