Damond Kloc.\n\"We're doing a very extreme canvas that's stretching over multiple city blocks,\" Kloc said.\nTwo of the four victims are adults; the other two are juveniles, Kloc said, adding that two of the victims were last reported to be in serious condition. Another suffered a minor injury. Kloc had no information about the fourth victim's extent of injuries.\nPolice said they took witnesses to headquarters for questioning, but they have been unable to develop a suspect.\n\"It's going to take some time to kind of go through witness accounts to determine exactly what happened,\" said Kloc.\nNo arrests have been made.\nAnyone with information about the shooting is urged to contact Crime Alert Berks County via anonymous text to 847411, or by calling 877-373-9913.
