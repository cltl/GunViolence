The man then took the woman\u2019s son and fled to his home two doors away. The woman\u2019s young daughter then ran to a neighbor\u2019s home where they called for help.\nInvestigators said police arrived at the scene and found the woman\u2019s body in a doorway and her youngest son, a 2-year-old, still inside. They took the unharmed boy to safety before they were directed to the man\u2019s house. Once they arrived at the man\u2019s house, officers heard a gunshot.\n\"One of the patrol officers heard a couple gunshots from that residence,\" Lt. Dan McGrath, of Metro, told media on Friday. \"At that point it was treated as a hostage situation.\"\nBelieving the man had a hostage, they backed away and called in crisis negotiators and the SWAT team.\nAbout two hours later, police went into the man\u2019s home, where they found the bodies of both the man and the woman\u2019s son who he had taken, police said.\nInvestigators did not immediately confirm the relationship between the boy and the woman who were killed, but a friend of the female victim confirmed to FOX5 that they were mother and son. A neighbor also said the juvenile victim was 10 years old.\nPolice said they are still trying to determine a motive for the killings. A neighbor, though, believed there may have been trouble between the shooter and the adult victim before.\n\"I've heard there has been some squabbling among the neighbors, because it was just a neighbor and another neighbor,\" said Celinda McDaniels, who lives in the area.\nThe identities of the victims and the man will later be released by the Clark County Coroner\u2019s Office.\nThe relationship between the man and the victims was not immediately released.\nThe deaths of the woman and boy marked the 97th and 98th homicides in Metro's jurisdiction this year.\nPolice were still looking for information in the case. They urged anyone with knowledge to contact Metro's Homicide Section at 702-828-3521 or at homicide@lvmpd.com.
