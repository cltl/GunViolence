He's an older gentleman, you know, he's in his 70s. So, he's a good guy,\" said Angela Carter, victim's neighbor.\n\"He was an outstanding gentleman. Just a father, like you,\" said Maurice Hall, victim's friend.\nRelatives said Branch was a retired maintenance worker who was a deacon at his church and devoted to his family.
