A prosecutor told the judge the state may \u201cdirect file\u201d the case against Hollinger to adult court. Manslaughter can carry a penalty of up to 30 years in prison.\nClick here to watch Gary Nelson\u2019s report.\nA defense attorney waived Hollinger\u2019s appearance in court, in order to avoid his being photographed by a television camera in the courtroom. No family members appeared in court.\nWitnesses told police a large group of family friends were talking in front of a home at 425 NW 13th Street when Hollinger brought out a gun. While showing it off, he thought he fully unloaded it and then fired it three times.\nThe gun, however, was loaded and the third time he pulled the trigger a bullet fired and struck Booker.\nBooker\u2019s friend, Ashley Kendall, who was across the street at the time of the shooting believes it was accidental.\n\u201cThey was playing with the gun and just trying to see like the parts of it and he was trying to take the bullets out but he left one in. He pointed it at him and he shot it. Nothing happened. Shot it again, nothing happened. The third time the boy got shot in the chest,\u201d said Ashley Kendall. \u201cI\u2019m very sad. I watched him die. It hurt my heart.\u201d\nAfter the shooting, Hollinger ran off and hid the gun in some nearby bushes. After giving sever false statements, he finally confessed during questioning, according to his arrest report.\nCBS4\u2019s Gary Nelson learned Hollinger told investigators that he had bought the gun off the street from another kid in what would be an illegal cash transaction.\nEarlier Tuesday, a man at Hollinger\u2019s home slammed the door on the face of a CBS4 News reporter.\nBooker was a seventh grader at Redlands Middle School. Friends said he loved to laugh and play football.\nThe dead boy\u2019s uncle on Tuesday said the family takes little comfort in Hollinger\u2019s arrest.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t bring Darin back,\u201d said the uncle, Travis Jackson. \u201cHe was only 13-years-old. It [the arrest] won\u2019t change nothing.\u201d\nCassandra Anderson, Darin\u2019s mother, said she was heartened to learn Hollinger will be held accountable for his actions, and spoke of the loss of her son.\n\u201cHe will never walk through my door again,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m expecting him to come home, but he will never come home again.\u201d\nA vigil in Darin\u2019s memory is planned for Thursday at 7pm at the scene of the shooting.\nRELATED CONTENT:\nFollow\nGary Nelson has been a member of the CBS4 News team since September, 1992, coming on board in the days following Hurricane Andrew, a storm that ripped a swath of devastation across our community and ripped the roof off Gary's house.
