That\u2019s my only son\u2019s son. Of course Iove him. We all know he wasn\u2019t a perfect kid but he was a loveable kid. Both sides know that.\u201d\nBooker\u2019s mother had hoped to speak to reporters outside the family\u2019s Florida City home. But when D\u2019Oench asked her if there was anything she would like to say about her son, she answered \u201cno\u201d and then broke down in tears and had to be escorted by loved ones into her home.\nIt happened around 9:20 p.m. at 425 NW 13th Street.\nWitnesses told police a large group of family and friends were talking in front of the home at that address when a 15-year old brought out a gun he said wasn\u2019t loaded. While showing it off, he fired three times at his friends.\nThe gun, however, was loaded and the third time he pulled the trigger a bullet fired and struck and killed 13-year old Darin Booker.\nBookers friend, Ashley Kendall, who was across the street at the time of the shooting believes it was accidental.\n\u201cThey was playing with the gun and just trying to see like the parts of it and he was trying to take the bullets out but he left one in. He pointed it at him and he shot it. Nothing happened. Shot it again, nothing happened. The third time the boy got shot in the chest,\u201d said Ashley Kendall. \u201cI\u2019m very sad. I watched him die. It hurt my heart.\u201d\n\u201cThey say this man pulled his gun and shot two times, two times and nothing came out,\u201d said Helen Booker. \u201cThat\u2019s murder. That\u2019s murder. The 3rd bullet came out after he pulled it.\u201d\nBooker\u2019s aunt, Michelle Jackson, said, \u201cThis is very painful, very painful. I helped raise Darin as a child. I just want to get to the bottom of this and hope that justice will play out.\u201d\nKiana Simmons, a friend of Booker, said she was in the house when she heard the shot.\n\u201cI came outside and it was like, no, my cousin came inside and said \u2018oh, somebody is shot, somebody is shot\u2019 he told momma. We came outside and Darin he hit, he hit the gate and fell and he was like taking his last breath. I was just crying cause that was hurtful, like we used to play together and we knew each other. We used to play football, basketball and today we were playing football in the park,\u201d said Simmons.\nViola Knight was one of the first adults to reach the scene of the shooting.\n\u201cAll the kids went running by, wild and screaming, they went and got his mother from around the corner. It\u2019s just sad, it\u2019s a sad tragedy,\u201d said Knight.\nBooker\u2019s cousin, Thomas Daniels, doesn\u2019t believe the shooting was an accident.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that, the whole neighborhood knows, everybody seen that it went, they knew that gun was loaded,\u201d said Daniels.\nDaniels said his cousin and two of the teens involved were friends who had recently had a falling out. Daniels believes his cousin was murdered.\n\u201cThey was his friends at one time but I guess he did something to them and they didn\u2019t like him no more and they did that to him,\u201d said Daniels.\nBooker was a seventh grader at Redlands Middle School. Friends said he loved to laugh and play football.\nHis sister, Keke Anderson, said \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem right. To think he was having a beef with those teenagers and we didn\u2019t know about. He didn\u2019t know if would mean so much trouble otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be around them. We just want to know what happened and why it happened.\u201d\nA vigil in Darin\u2019s memory is planned for Thursday at 7 pm at the scene of the shooting.\nRELATED CONTENT:"}
