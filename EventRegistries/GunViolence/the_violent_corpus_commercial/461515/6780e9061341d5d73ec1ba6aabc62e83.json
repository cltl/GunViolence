Many, like Gibson, are fathers and parents themselves.\n\"It has a big impact, but we want to be as thorough as we can and we have a specific job to do and we have to separate that emotion from the job that we have ahead of us,\" Gibson added.\nInvestigators believe this is the result of a domestic situation.\nThe investigation interrupted the commute home for those living in the neighborhood as officers required ID from anyone living near the crime scene.\n\"We never have any problems around here, ever. This is the quietest neighborhood I've ever lived in. There's a lot of older people that live around here and we all know each other,\" Angela Kelley, who lives nearby, said.\nSeveral agencies were on the scene, including Cleveland police, Bradley County Sheriff's Office, the District Attorney, and the Medical Examiner.\nStay with Channel 3 on-air and online for updates to this story."}
