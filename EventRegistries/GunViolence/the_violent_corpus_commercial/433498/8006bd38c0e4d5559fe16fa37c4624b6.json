In a statement they described him as \"a wonderful young man.\"\nLakewood police say Demello, his 14-year-old brother and a 17-year-old friend all live in Woodbrook, a civilian community next to JBLM. The three of them went through a hole in the fence onto JBLM property in the woods near 150th Street SW and Woodbrook Drive South on Oct. 20.\nPolice say the 17-year-old had a handgun with him that \"discharged\" and hit Demello in the face.
