Gombar said.On Aug. 5, Mark Short took the three children to Hersheypark as part of a family day sponsored by his employer, investigators said.

The family dog also was found dead.Dr. Neil W. Hoffman, a forensic pathologist, determined after an Aug. 8 autopsy that Mark Short died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head from the revolver found next to his body, investigators said.The children and Megan Short appeared to have been sleeping in the living room before they were shot because they were found in pajamas under blankets, Gombar said.Investigators would not specify the order of the killings, but said Mark Short fired a total of six shots, one of which killed his dog.Detectives with the district attorney's office took over the investigation from Sinking Spring police and seized several items for forensic analysis.District Attorney John T. Adams said police did everything they are legally permitted to do to help a woman who reports abuse by an intimate partner.\u201cThis was a very, very unfortunate incident,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI don't know that anything can be learned other than when leaving an abusive relationship it's often a very dangerous time for a victim, so we urge anyone who's in a similar situation to develop a safety plan and contact their local domestic violence agency for assistance.\u201dAdams added: \u201cWe want to express our deepest sympathy to all family members affected by this tragedy.

Adams said the suicide note included a confession that he killed his family.At the family's request, authorities are not giving more details on the contents of the note.On the day of the slayings, Adams said, Mark Short was going to rent a moving van to help his wife move out. She was going to take the children with her.Adams said Mark Short had no known mental health issues, but he was clearly distraught over the breakup of his marriage.He had been demoted at his job, a mortgage company, in part due to poor attendance, he said.\u201cI don't think we know specifically as to why this relationship had disintegrated,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe don't have specific answers for that.\u201dThe family was featured in an October 2014 story in the Reading Eagle.
