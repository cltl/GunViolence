For the most part, he sat with his head held down.\nDavis has not been charged in connection with last Saturday\u2019s shooting death of Hayden Mayes. The 2-year-old toddler died from a single gunshot wound to the chest he received at Davis\u2019 home.\nFamily members of the child said it was not uncommon for Hayden and others to play at Davis\u2019 residence, which is about 100 feet from the Mayes home. They said Davis enjoyed having the children at his home.\nDavis\u2019 criminal history in Bamberg County shows the Mill Street man was sentenced to seven years concurrently on charges of first-degree burglary and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature in 2000.\nIn August 2000, drug charges against him were dropped. Another pair of drug charges against Davis were dropped in 1994 after it was determined the state\u2019s key witness was not reliable, court records show."}
