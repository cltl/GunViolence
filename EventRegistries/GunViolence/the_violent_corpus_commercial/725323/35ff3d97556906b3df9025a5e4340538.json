They said she was a homebody, a straight-A student and had been working hard and saving her money, with plans to buy her first car the day she was found murdered.\nA spokesperson for the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office homicide unit said investigators are pursuing all credible leads, but could not release any other details due to the sensitive nature of the homicide.\n\u201cIf God gave me one wish, I would just ask Him to give us one day with her, just so we know that she knows we love her and how much we miss her,\u201d said Natasha Johnwell, the victim\u2019s mother.\nIt\u2019s the way Johnwell chooses to remember her daughter, Kelcii: the what if\u2019s and the photos of happier times.\nBut the regret, that she couldn\u2019t prevent her daughter\u2019s murder is a real-life nightmare she can\u2019t shake.\n\u201cAll I see is her on her knees and begging for me and Emmanuel. For 19 years I protected her and just this one time I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Johnwell.\nJohnwell\u2019s son Emmanuel Amons is by her side.\nHe told KHOU 11 he helped raise his baby sister in Louisiana, but when he got in trouble with the law, Kelcii moved to Houston to be with her mom and finish up school.\nJohnwell said Kelcii met Willie Norman, also found murdered, and they soon fell in love.\n\u201cHe showed me so much passion and love he had for my sister that I felt so comfortable with her leaving with him,\u201d said Amons as he described his first time meeting Norman, just days before the murders.\nJohnwell said Willie had a troubled past but had recently turned his life around.\n\u201cYou may meet a person that makes you want to change your life and I honestly, truly believe that Kelcii did that for him,\u201d said Johnwell.\nAnd even though she's gone, Kelcii seems to still have that effect on those she leaves behind.\n\u201cFocus on her school, be successful in life. Be somebody in life, so I\u2019m gonna take her energy and put it towards my life,\u201d said Amons.\n(\u00a9 2017 KHOU)"}
