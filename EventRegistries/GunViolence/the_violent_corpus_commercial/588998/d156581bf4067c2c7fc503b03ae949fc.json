Her mother told KCCI Destiny is in critical condition in the intensive care unit, though she is expected to survive.\n\"It's really surreal because my family has lived here for over 20 years, and we've never had anything, maybe a high-speed chase through the neighborhood, but nothing this detrimental,\" neighbor Antoinette Hill said. \"It's a little bit scary, especially since you know they have the expression that bullets have no names. But it's one of those situations where it could've happened anywhere.\"\nHill said she feels safe in the neighborhood, though Saturday night's shooting has her on edge.\n\"When it's right next door to your house, you can't believe it,\" Hill said. \"It's different when you hear about it on the news and hear about it in the environment and in the neighborhood, but when it's right next door, it's just very uncomfortable.\"\nDes Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek said a 14-year-old boy has been charged with reckless use of a firearm causing injury, a Class C felony, in the case.\nThe shooting appears to be accidental.\nPolice said they are unsure of the relationship between the victim and the shooter.\nCheck back with KCCI-TV, kcci.com or our mobile apps for developments to this story."}
