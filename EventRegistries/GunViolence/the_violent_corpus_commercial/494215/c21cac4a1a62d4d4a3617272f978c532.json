Some say new gun laws or tighter restrictions are necessary to curb gun violence. Others say the laws in place are just fine, that law enforcement needs to do a better job enforcing them.\nWith this endeavor, I wanted to see whether the allegations, testimony and data contained in thousands of pages of court documents would provide useful evidence in the debate. I created this reporter\u2019s notebook to track some gun crime cases from 2013 that stood out to me as being either fairly typical or unusual.\nJanuary\nBullets fired from upstairs\nMinneapolis police\u2019s organized crime unit is investigating Nitelen Dereese Jackson, 23, for being a prohibited person with a firearm.
