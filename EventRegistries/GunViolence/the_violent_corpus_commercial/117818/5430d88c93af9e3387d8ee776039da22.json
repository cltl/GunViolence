When the crowd dispersed, Nathan was dead, three people were wounded, and the gunman had fled, police reported.\nJack said the shootout involved multiple factions and multiple firearms. Prosecution witnesses identified Bell after seeing his Facebook photo, she said.\n\u201cBell was inside the club on the dance floor bringing a pretty girl a drink to celebrate her birthday when shots rang out,\u201d Jack said.\nOne witness had previously denied seeing the shooter at all, Jack said. Another repeatedly told police he would not be able to recognize the gunman, and the final witness admitted being drunk that night and never actually seeing the shooting, Jack said.\nNone of the scientific tests performed linked Bell to the shooting, Christy Jack, defense attorney.\n\u201cEarly in their investigation, authorities interviewed an eyewitness who informed police that Bell was not involved in the shooting, and another witness placed Bell inside the club when gunfire erupted outside,\u201d Jack said.\nAlso, she said, \u201cNone of the scientific tests performed linked Bell to the shooting.\u201d And other suspects were never investigated, Jack said.\n\u201cThe Bell family is overcome with gratitude and relief that their son will not spend one more day behind bars for a crime he did not commit,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThis case illustrates how social media, Facebook in particular, has ushered in a new frontier of suggestibility when it comes to eyewitness identification. We are thankful for the jury\u2019s verdicts and that justice was served.\u201d\nProsecutors declined to comment. Arlington police have not identified any other suspects, said VaNessa Harrison, Arlington police spokeswoman.\nCandice Rainwater, Nathan\u2019s sister, said that Nathan was a rap artist and was at the sports bar that night with his brother to see if they could perform. The brother, A\u2019leke Rainwater, 20, of Arlington, was wounded, she said.\nNathan was the father of three sons and had another baby due at the time of his death, a relative said.\nThis report includes material from the Star-Telegram archives.\nMitch Mitchell: 817-390-7752, @mitchmitchel3"}
