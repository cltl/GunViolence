An estimated 200 people were at the party in a red-brick, corner-lot mansion at 2272 Scottwood Ave.\nThe music was loud, the girls were pretty, and initially, the atmosphere was fun.\nAbout an hour into the party, at 10:26 p.m., Rebecca Boone called the Toledo police nonemergency phone line to report an underage-drinking party at the house.\n\u201cThe house was full,\u201d said Ms. Boone, a 10-year Old West End resident. \u201cThere were kids everywhere. We know the neighborhood, and we know that's not right.\u201d\nAt 10:51 p.m., another caller made a noise complaint. About 20 minutes later, more calls \u2014 now for a fight.\n\u201cEverything started around 11, it started getting rowdy,\u201d said Mr. Bolden, who was treated at Toledo Hospital for a graze wound to the left side of his abdomen. \u201cYou could feel the tension. You could feel in the atmosphere something was going to happen. Before we could leave, that's when everything started going crazy.\u201d\nMr. Bolden said a group of people got into a fight and ran outside, possibly to retrieve guns.\nAbout this time, a security officer from Signal 88, a private security company that patrols the Old West End, was at the scene, waiting for police to arrive.\nAt 11:16 p.m., \u201cshots-fired\u201d calls started coming in to Toledo police.\n\u201cMy officer actually heard the shots, and that's when he heard a bunch of people screaming, and they all started to pour into the street,\u201d said Ian Scherer, a Signal 88 shift supervisor. \u201cHe pointed women who were screaming for help toward his vehicle for cover.\u201d\nTwo minutes later, at 11:18, police were dispatched. The first crews arrived four minutes later.\n\u201cI look out the window and it looked like a swarm of kids,\u201d said neighbor Susan Craig, who has lived in her home, with her husband Alex, for 46 years. \u201cKids were running left and right, helter-skelter.\u201d\nAs people were leaving the party, piling into cars, more shots were fired.\nMr. Scherer, who showed up at the Scottwood home after the shooting, said people in cars were shooting at other people in cars, continuing to fire as they sped off.\nA total of four people, including Mr. Bolden, were wounded in the shooting. Treated for \u201cminor injuries\u201d were Ronald Smith, 22, Taylor McCormick, 19, and Sidresha Lamb, 17, all of Toledo.\n\u201cI'll call it hell,\u201d Mr. Bolden said. \"A bullet ain't got no name. They'll come at anybody.\u201d\nMs. Boone and other Old West End residents, who sounded off on social media, said police should have responded sooner.\n\u201cI definitely think they dropped the ball,\u201d Ms. Boone said. \u201cThey just didn't take action quick enough. I know we're short on cops \u2026 but they already knew it was a problem house.\u201d\nPolice Sgt. Joe Heffernan said that, on busy nights \u2014 like weekends, when 911-call volume often increases \u2014 \u201cwe have to prioritize our calls by level of importance.\u201d\n\u201cThe initial call \u2026 had not been dispatched because of higher priority calls,\u201d the sergeant said.\nAbout three weeks earlier, police and Signal 88 were sent to the house to break up another party, Mr. Scherer said.\nThe Scottwood house's wrap-around porch was littered Monday afternoon with broken glass. A tipped-over city garbage can lay on the ground with at least one empty liquor bottle inside. A man who answered the door declined to comment.\n\u201cTo have something of this nature happen here is unsettling,\u201d said Mr. Craig. \u201cBut we're not about to move.\u201d\nContact Taylor Dungjen at tdungjen@theblade.com, or 419-724-6054, or on Twitter @taylordungjen."}
