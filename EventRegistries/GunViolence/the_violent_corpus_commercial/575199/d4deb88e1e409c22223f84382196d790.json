She stated that he came to the bedroom at that time to get his nighttime medications, and that he sleeps in another bedroom in the home due to frequently waking up during the night. She told officers she woke up Wednesday morning and noticed the door to the building behind the house was open and felt something wasn\u2019t right and after looking, found him unresponsive in the building. She then called 911.

Authorities found gun-cleaning supplies on the table in the building. The investigation is finished and has been ruled an accidental shooting."}
