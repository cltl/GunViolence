They now face life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted.\nBecause Brizuela was 17 when the killings occurred, he is not eligible for the death penalty. However, he could be sent to prison for life if he is found guilty.\nDeputy District Attorney Christine Bannon made the announcement Tuesday in front of Vista Superior Court Judge Carlos Armour. She did not give any specific reasons as to why prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty, but she explained that District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis had met with the defense lawyers in the case, as well as other high-level prosecutors in her office and consulted with the victims' family members.\nThe defendants are accused of ambushing and killing Melanie Virgen, 13, and Edgar Sanchez, 15, on a hilltop at the Oceanside park. The pair was seated on a couch near a makeshift memorial for two other teens gunned down at the same spot in 2011.\nPolice and prosecutors have said the 2013 attack was motivated by a gang rivalry, but the victims, including two older teen boys who were wounded but survived, did not have gang ties."}
