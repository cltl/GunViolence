And if anybody does know anything, I\u2019d really hope they\u2019d man up and say what they know. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re snitching \u2014 he was a victim and he was a good guy.\u201d\nThe other three men, who ranged in age from 20 to 22, were listed in stable condition.\nNo word on a suspect or motive.\nAnyone with information is asked to call 911.\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2011 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
