When officers arrived, they found Reginald B. Brown III, 18, and four others suffering from gunshot wounds, authorities said.\nBrown died shortly after he was taken to a hospital, and the other victims suffered wounds that didn\u2019t appear to be life threatening, police said.\nPolice said the shooting didn\u2019t appear to be a random incident and detectives are still working to determine a motive or suspect.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, friends and relatives gathered at the scene of the shooting.\n\u201cHe was getting a job and he was turning his life around,\u201d said Brown\u2019s cousin Nikki Washington as she sat on some steps surrounded by a dozen friends. \u201cWhen it gets close it hurts.\u201d\nUp and down the 4700 block of Pard Road, people were talking about the shooting and Brown.\n\u201cHe made everyone smile; people wanted to be around him,\u201d said one man with a big smile who asked for anonymity for fear of reprisal. \u201cHe was good in football but not basketball.\u201d\nAnother young man in the block, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, \u201cReggie wanted to do something for himself.\u201d\nFriends say Brown moved around often to avoid trouble and said they believe he wasn\u2019t meant to be the target of the shots fired Tuesday. \u201cHe was a good guy, but sometimes good guys hang out with bad people,\u201d said another elderly man who knew Brown and also feared giving his name.\nOn social media, photos of a memorial appeared from friends who apparently knew him. Some posted pictures of \u201cLil Reggie,\u201d saying he was \u201cthe last person I would expect this to happen\u201d to, and his \u201clife ended so early.\u201d\nA $25,000 reward is available for any information leading to an arrest or indictment in this case.\nPolice are asking anyone with information to call 301-772-4925 or, to remain anonymous, 866-411-TIPS.\nDana Hedgpeth contributed to this report."}
