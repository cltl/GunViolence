(Aug. 28, 2015) \u2013 Officials in Henry County are investigating after three bodies were found in a home just east of Knightstown Thursday morning.\nOfficers were first called to the home in the 5500 block of West Old National Road to conduct a welfare check after one of the children in the home had not shown up to school. That\u2019s when investigators found the bodies of two children and one adult male.\nOn Friday, Henry County Prosecutor Joe Bergacs confirmed the two children died of gunshot wounds, and the father died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nAccording to Henry County Prosecutor Joe Bergacs, a deputy looked through a window and observed a young boy on the floor. Deputies forced entry into the house and determined the 5-year-old boy was deceased. Upon a search of the home, deputies found an 11-year-old girl, who was also deceased. The children's father, 48-year-old Joseph Horn, was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound.\nCourt records show Horn's wife filed for divorce on August 11.\nProsecutor Bergacs said there is no evidence a suspect is at large. The horrific discovery has left neighbors in the small community absolutely stunned.\n\u201cThis just does not happen in this area whatsoever. It\u2019s just unreal,\u201d said neighbor Sheila Rawlins.\nShelia owns the land right across the street from the home.\nShe says the family, a man and woman and two kids, had moved into the home earlier this year.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies won\u2019t confirm the ages of the people found inside the house, nor would they say exactly how the victims died.\nInvestigators did say the bodies were found throughout the house.\nNeighbors are heartbroken to think children may have lost their lives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Rawlins. \u201cI can\u2019t believe someone would do that to two kids.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing and it\u2019s sad,\u201d said neighbor Janine Mattix. \u201cThe kids didn\u2019t ask for that.\u201d\nJanine says the homeowner claimed to be retired military, spent most of his days at home and always walked around with a gun on his hip.\nNeighbors also tell us the couple had been going through some domestic issues and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a fractured relationship led to the deaths.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t real conformable around the man. I didn\u2019t get a good vibe off him. If he\u2019s responsible, it doesn\u2019t really surprise me,\u201d said Mattix.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad the kids were the victims. It\u2019s a sad thing that they had to pay the price,\u201d said neighbor Ross Manche.\nYou need to have the Adobe Flash Player to view this content. Please click here to continue."}
