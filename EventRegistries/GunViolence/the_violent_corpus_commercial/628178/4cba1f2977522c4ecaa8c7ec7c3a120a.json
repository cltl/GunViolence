Williams is still in the hospital, according to Gregory, who was released from the hospital Monday.\nPolice are still searching for the gunman.\nGregory said he hopes police find whoever the shooter is because he knows tensions are running high in the neighborhood, and he wants justice for Tamia, whom he considers a stepdaughter.\n\u201cI hope they get them. I really do,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cBut police ain\u2019t the only people that are looking for them, so I hope that police get to them before anyone else does.\u201d\nGregory said Tamia was an honor student, and he can't believe she's gone.\n\u201cShe was an angel, had the prettiest smile, just an all-around great kid,\u201d Gregory said. \u201c(She) wasn\u2019t in too much trouble; never stayed out too late. She ain\u2019t never did anything like that.\u201d\nGregory said he was shot in the lower back, and the bullet bounced off his pelvic bone and exited through his backside. He was still hobbling from the wound Monday.\n\u201cWe were all just sitting on the porch enjoying our Friday, enjoying our day off, and I had just got home from work. I wasn\u2019t even home an hour,\u201d Gregory said.\nA second unidentified man was also shot, according to police.\nAnyone with any information about the shooting is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 866-845-TIPS.\nGregory said Tamia's family is in touch with a victims' service agency to discuss funeral arrangements, which have not been finalized yet.\nCopyright 2016 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved."}
