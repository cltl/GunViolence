Two adults were home, but the Paisie was in a room by himself.\n\u201cThey heard the sound of a shot and then came in and found the child injured and immediately called 911,\u201d Gleaton said. \u201cUnfortunately, the victim had passed away at the scene.\u201d\nGleaton said Paisie\u2019s death will be ruled an accidental shooting.\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the family of the child. It\u2019s a tragic event,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, I would urge people, if they are going to choose to have firearms in their homes, I just encourage them to be responsible and store them safely and separately from ammunition. Keep them under lock and key at all times when not in use.\u201d\nPasie was born in Macon and attended Riverside United Methodist Church, according to his obituary.\nLaura Corley: 478-744-4334, @Lauraecor"}
