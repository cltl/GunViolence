Police say he directed them to a nearby hotel room where officers found the four people \u2014 three adults and a child \u2014 dead of apparent gunshot wounds. Police said in a statement the shooting appears to have occurred shortly before officers arrived.\nPolice spokesman Doug Wellborn said a single firearm was found inside the hotel room.\nFriday night, police released the names of the deceased:\n54-year-old Linda Hutton\n22-year-old Emily McDonald\n22-year-old McKay Hutton\n8-week-old Teagan Hutton\n\u201cPreliminary investigation shows McKay shot the other three victims and then committed suicide,\u201d Wellborn wrote.\nWellborn stated that the man crying in the hallway is a family member of at least one of the victims, and is not considered a suspect in the investigation. He said police do not believe he was present for the shooting.\nYumi McCulloch, a spokeswoman for FPD, said the victims were related to one another \u2014 Linda Hutton was McKay Hutton\u2019s mother, and McDonald and McKay Hutton were married and were both parents to Teagan.\nMason Jefferies calls himself a school buddy to McKay Hutton, whom he described as a family man. He said McKay Hutton took in McDonald\u2019s son from a previous relationship and treated him as his own son. McKay Hutton posted on the Facebook group Fairbanks \u201cROCKS\u201d!, showing off some of the family\u2019s adventures at local parks.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an overall great person, and he\u2019s a lovable man,\u201d Jefferies said in a phone interview. \u201cA little rowdy at times, but he\u2019s a very fun person, and lovable.\u201d\nJefferies said McDonald was kindhearted like her husband, and he was surprised when he learned of their deaths.\n\u201cThey loved each other, they loved their country, and I don\u2019t see a reason why they would have any complications in their relationship, but everybody has things that go on in their life that people don\u2019t understand, so people are quick to judge, and they should take a sec to realize this tragic situation and give prayers for that,\u201d he said.\nMcDonald\u2019s mother, Linda Hendrick, recently moved away from Anchorage to New Mexico, but said since hearing the news, she has made plans to return.\n\u201cWhen I was called and notified that my daughter and grand daughter were murdered, I fell to my knees and cried like never before,\u201d she said. \u201cThis news has destroyed me. No one deserves this! Emily was a wonderful person, and an amazing mother.\u201d\nHendrick said McDonald was exploring the idea of becoming a registered nurse, having acquired her CNA license. She was working at Lilley Lodge LLC, an assisted-living home, and was on maternity leave when she died, her boss Terryann Gainer confirmed.\nPolice said there was no indication that drugs or alcohol were involved in the deaths, and they were still investigating the motive behind the crime.\n\u201cThere have been questions regarding another child. That child\u2019s identity is not being released at this time but he was not present during this incident and is safe,\u201d Wellborn said. \u201cRelationship between this child and any of the victims is still being investigated.\u201d\nThe Hampton Inn posted a statement to the hotel\u2019s Facebook page Saturday morning:\nFPD stated there is no threat to public safety in this case. Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Detective Avery Thompson at 907-459-6549 or by email at athompson@ci.fairbanks.ak.us.\nThis is a developing story; please check back for updates."}
