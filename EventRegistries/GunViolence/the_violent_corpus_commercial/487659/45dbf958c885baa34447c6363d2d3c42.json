LOUIS \u2022 From the 1900 block of Warren Street, where five people were wounded early Tuesday in a wild night of gunfire, downtown\u2019s office towers and the Gateway Arch are within sight. Girls jump rope in the street as toddlers frolic on the stone stoops of 19th-century row houses.\nAs the kids played noisily Tuesday evening, a police car rolled slowly down the street. Juanita Sparks, 60, sat at her front door with a granddaughter and said she plans to move out.\n\u201cI am tired of thugs,\u201d said Starks, who has lived on the block for three years. \u201cWe go in at night and stay in, no matter what. It\u2019s too rough a life here.\u201d\nNot just on the 1900 block of Warren, at least not during a six-hour period late Monday and Tuesday. Seventeen people were wounded in seven apparently unrelated shooting incidents, and another man was hurt in an attack involving a knife. Nobody died, although two victims were in critical condition.\nMayor Francis Slay also expressed frustration.\n\u201cIn the vast majority of these cases, people are using their guns to settle their own petty feuds, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s very unfortunate and outrageous about this,\u201d he said Tuesday.\nThe crimes ranged from flares of domestic temper to gang infighting to drug rivalries, police said. Investigators believe most victims and attackers were acquainted. Officials pledged to intensify patrols, and put about 75 detectives who are normally plainclothes, such as homicide investigators, in uniform to increase police visibility.\n\u201cOfficers on the street will be more comfortable asking them for assistance,\u201d said Lt. Col. Alfred Adkins.\nRick Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist under contract to help city police develop enforcement strategies, said aggravated assaults involving guns soared by 20 percent in 2012, but had fallen 25 percent so far this year. In keeping with predictable patterns, last year\u2019s surge in violence coincided with warmer temperatures, he said.\n\u201cThere is no indication that we\u2019re on the same path this year, though last night certainly is very troubling,\u201d Rosenfeld said Tuesday. \u201cA quarter drop in one year is important context here and is just as important as the seriousness of eight violent events in a single night. We\u2019re still running at much lower levels of firearms violence this year.\u201d\nAdkins, in command with Chief Sam Dotson on vacation, said the city averages 33 firearms-related incidents each week, ranging from flourishings to shootings. He said officers have responded to seven shooting incidents within a 24-hour period at least 13 times since 2011, \u201cbut not to the degree to which it happened last night.\u201d\nAdkins promised an intensified police reaction in the crime areas, and urged gun owners to take extra precautions after six firearms were stolen from cars just the night before.\nPolice did not report any arrests in the attacks by late Tuesday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always concerned about retaliation, especially with no one in custody or arrested,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cSome of the people, we know, are documented gang members that were involved in disputes that occurred beforehand.\u201d\nThe incidents:\n\u2022 A man, 30, was shot about 8:05 p.m. Monday in the 3100 block of Bell Avenue. He said he was playing basketball when someone he did not know shot him in the right buttock, hip, calf and ankle.\n\u2022 A man, 28, was shot in the arm about 9:08 p.m. Monday in the 3000 block of North Florissant Avenue during what police described as \u201can ongoing personal dispute.\u201d\n\u2022 Six people were shot about 10:30 p.m. Monday in the 4700 block of Highland Avenue. Police said all the wounds were relatively minor. The victims were a woman, 34; a woman, 22; a man, 17; a girl, 14; a boy, 14; and a boy, 13. Police suspect the attack was retaliation for an earlier fight involving the juveniles.\n\u2022 Three people were shot shortly before 11 p.m. Monday, in the 700 block of Aubert Avenue: men, 28 and 25, and a woman, 26. Police said all were expected to survive.\n\u2022 A man, 41, was shot in the knee about 11:20 p.m. Monday in what he said was a robbery attempt the 3800 block of Hartford Street.\n\u2022 A homeless man, 21, was stabbed about 1 a.m. Tuesday in an altercation with a building maintenance worker who encountered him in the 4200 block of South 38th Street. The victim was in critical condition; the worker was sought by police.\n\u2022 Five people were wounded about 1:05 a.m. Tuesday by a man with an AK-47 rifle who confronted a group emerging from a home in the 1900 block of Warren. They fled into a nearby apartment, where the gunman kicked open the door and opened fire. The wounded were men, 22 and 23, and women 18, 20 and 21. The 20-year-old was in critical condition. Police said the attack might be linked to shots fired at one man by three others, without injury, in the 1800 block of Warren on Monday.\n\u2022 Shortly before 2 a.m. Tuesday, a man, 19, was shot in the leg as he left a club called Daddy\u2019s Money, 5300 North Broadway.\nSlay renewed his call for judges to establish a dedicated \u201carmed-offender docket\u201d to focus on violent crimes. An effort to have the Legislature force the issue, supported by Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce and Dotson, failed this spring.\n\u201cThere must be consequences,\u201d Slay said. \u201cThese are disputes, and there are victims who won\u2019t talk to the police. Trying to make an arrest isn\u2019t that simple. In one case, they\u2019ve got (multiple) people shot and not one of them would identify the shooter.\u201d\nBack on the 1900 block of Warren on Tuesday evening, Savanna Courtney, 28, blamed outsiders who hang out on the street of old row homes and vacant lots. She said there have been five shootings on the block since she moved there in February, including the one early Tuesday that wounded one of her brothers.\nOne block to the west, Albert James mowed the front lawn of his tidy new home in the 2700 block of North 21st Street. James said he didn\u2019t hear the gunfire, but he was angered and depressed by the report on the morning TV news.\nHe listed frustrations any suburbanite would understand \u2014 too many young people without discipline or employment, too many guns, not enough churchgoing, too much glorification of violence in popular music.\n\u201cI like city living,\u201d said James, 45. \u201cI just wish some parents would quit being afraid of their kids and act like parents. So much of our society is so wrong.\u201d\nValerie Schremp Hahn and Tim O\u2019Neil of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report."}
