The boy was checked out at the hospital, but is OK.\nThe bullet grazed the back of the boy\u2019s leg, police say, but did not penetrate the skin.\nOne witness said he was surprised by the shooting in broad daylight.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, especially in the middle of the day on a Saturday,\u201d the man said. \u201cIts just a shame. You know, Brockton is trying to clean the city up. Things are going good and then this happens. It\u2019s discouraging being a resident.\u201d\nThe boy does not live in the Brockton home.\nNo arrests had been made as of Saturday evening. Police are still investigating the incident."}
