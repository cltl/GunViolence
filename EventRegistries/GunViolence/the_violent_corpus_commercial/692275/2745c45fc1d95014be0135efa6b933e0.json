The bullet traveled through the wall and struck Corporal James Bertorello in the leg.\n\"Both of the officers have been extensively trained. I don\u2019t know if it was a gun malfunction, or if it was the officer,\" said Sergeant Mike Wilbanks with the Farmington Police Department. \"We\u2019ll find out as we investigate. We called Washington County in as a third party to investigate, and then we\u2019ll do an internal after that. \"\nBertorello\u2019s injuries are not life-threatening."}
