When they arrived, they found a 15-year-old boy, who had been shot once in the head and died.\n\"There was some alcohol involved earlier that evening, horse play and next thing you know, gun was pulled out. he did not realize they had one in the chamber and during the horse play with the gun, the shot was fired and struck his young, 15-yr-old in the face area,\" said Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi.\nThe boy's cousin, Shawn Griffin, 23, of Plaquemine has been arrested for the killing. Sheriff Stassi said it's an unfortunate shooting because Griffin was playing around with the gun and thought it was empty, accidentally shooting and killing his own cousin. He's now charged with negligent homicide.\n\"This is not like a hunting accident out in the woods where we might wait for the grand jury to come back. In this particular case, because you know you have a gun, you know you're pointing it at an individual, that's why he was charged with negligent homicide in this case,\" said Sheriff Stassi.\nPeople in the community said Griffin is an Iraq war veteran and one of the nicest people you will ever meet. They add it's just an unfortunate situation and one that's left a family mourning not only over the victim, but also for the alleged shooter.\nGriffin has a $10,000 bond set.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB.
