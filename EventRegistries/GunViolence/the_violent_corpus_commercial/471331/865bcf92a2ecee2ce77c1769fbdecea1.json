Parker as the man involved in a shooting Wednesday that left him and his two daughters dead.\nParker, 37, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound shortly after noon Thursday. He is suspected of shooting to death his daughters Mackenzie Parker, 8, and Haylee Parker, 5, before turning the gun on himself, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said in a news release.\nThe incident occurred at Veranda at Ventana Condominiums at 5751 N. Kolb Road, north of East Sunrise Drive.\nShortly before 7 p.m. Wednesday, deputies responded to the home for a check welfare after the girls' mother called 911 to say she received a call from her estranged husband. The woman reported that her husband said that was the last time she would hear from her children, said Deputy Courtney Rodriguez, a Pima County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman.\nDeputies arrived at the condominium in over four minutes, and attempted to talk to the father from outside the house. Deputies then heard a gunshot and went into the home where they found the father with a gunshot wound. They also found the older child dead, and the younger child and man were transported to the hospital, Rodriguez said.\nThe younger child was pronounced dead at the hospital Wednesday. The father succumbed to his wounds Thursday.\nThe girls were at their father's home because he had shared custody with their mother, Rodriguez said.\nParker and the victims' mother have been separated since September, the sheriff's department said in the news release.\nParker's Facebook page states he served in the Arizona Army National Guard and worked as a manager at Raytheon."}
