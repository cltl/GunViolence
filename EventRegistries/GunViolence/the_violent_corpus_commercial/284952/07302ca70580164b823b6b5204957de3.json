Michael Woody. \u201cThe weapon went off, striking the girl.\u201d\nThe girl was rushed to a hospital but was dead on arrival.\nThe shooting has led to the arrest of the father of a 14-year-old boy who was in the home when the incident occurred.\n\u201cAn investigation showed that the adult was the owner of the home and of the weapon,\u201d Woody said. \u201cBecause he was a convicted felon, he has been charged as a felon in possession of a handgun. We also discovered he has a number of traffic warrants.\n\u201cWe have presented our findings to the prosecutor\u2019s office, and there may be other charges coming from that office. The homeowner is currently in custody.\u201d\nThe arrest was the latest twist in a bloody Tuesday in Detroit involving shootings that included the teenage girl and two adults (including a pregnant woman).\nThe adults were wounded in a drive-by assault while sitting in a car.\nAccording to police, one of the adult victims is a witness in a homicide case.\nThe shooting was reported about 5:45 p.m. near John R and Winchester.\nA Camaro was headed north on John R when a burgundy vehicle of unknown make came up behind and someone inside sprayed the Camaro with bullets, police said.\nThe victims, including woman who is six months pregnant, drove themselves to a local hospital with non-life threatening injuries.\nAnyone with information in the shootings is asked to call Detroit police at (313) 596-2260 or (313) 596-1140."}
