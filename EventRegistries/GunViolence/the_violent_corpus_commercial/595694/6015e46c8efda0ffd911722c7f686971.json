Doctors have decided not to remove the bullet due to fear of additional damage. JESSIE WARDARSKI/Tulsa World\nVIDEO: Parent's of 9-Year-Old Gun Shot Victim Speak Out\nA 9-year-old baseball player doesn\u2019t ever want to see a fireworks show again.\nGrant Pinkstaff was one of two people who were struck in the head by a bullet while they were in the crowd of 80,000 people at Tulsa\u2019s FreedomFest on Independence Day. The bullet entered near the top of his head and traveled under the skin around his skull. It is now resting permanently near the back of his head.\nThough unsure at first, doctors are now telling the boy\u2019s parents he will make a full recovery despite ongoing pain and loss of some peripheral vision in his right eye.\nThe bullet\u2019s location is not life-threatening, and doctors said the risk of surgery wasn\u2019t worth its removal, his parents said Thursday evening.\nGrant\u2019s father, Mark Pinkstaff, said he hopes the peripheral vision loss won\u2019t affect Grant\u2019s ability as a left-handed first baseman.\n\u201cNow that we know he\u2019s alive, we find out that other people had this happen, as well,\u201d Pinkstaff said.\nBranon Vaughan, an adult who was walking to his car after the fireworks show, was struck by a bullet that embedded in his right cheek about the same time Grant was hit.\nMark Pinkstaff said he\u2019s been in different stages of trauma since his son first told him \u201csomething hit him hard.\u201d\nPinkstaff took off his shirt after realizing how much his son was bleeding, but it wasn\u2019t until hours later that a scan revealed that he\u2019d been hit by a bullet.\n\u201cHe told me twice, \u2018Daddy, I don\u2019t want to die,\u2019 \u201d Pinkstaff said.\nNow that Grant\u2019s prognosis \u2014 despite astronomical odds, according to his doctor \u2014 is mostly clear, his father is focusing on getting the word out that someone should be held accountable.\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to be accountable for this. It\u2019s just not acceptable,\u201d Pinkstaff said. \u201cThe Fourth of July is about fireworks \u2014 not guns.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cSomething needs to be done. Somebody saw something. If you did, call the police.\u201d\nPinkstaff added that he could forgive a teenager who made a mistake with a gun he wasn\u2019t supposed to have. Regardless of the scenario, though, he said someone should answer for it.\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m kind of assured that my child will survive, \u2026 I can forgive,\u201d he said. But \u201cwhatever the reason, someone has to be held accountable for this.\u201d\nAnnette Pinkstaff, Grant\u2019s mother and Mark Pinkstaff\u2019s ex-wife, drove Grant to the hospital and was there when they learned that he\u2019d been hit by a bullet.\n\u201cI was losing it,\u201d Annette Pinkstaff said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Mama, I\u2019m going to be OK.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cYou feel helpless because you want the swelling to go down and the blood to go away,\u201d his mother said.\nThe family is hoping to have Grant home for his 10th birthday on Sunday but are planning to postpone his party to throw him a much larger one than they had planned.\n\u201cGrant said he never wants to see another fireworks show ever,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe\u2019ll have that bullet to remind him that he\u2019s a miracle.\u201d"}
