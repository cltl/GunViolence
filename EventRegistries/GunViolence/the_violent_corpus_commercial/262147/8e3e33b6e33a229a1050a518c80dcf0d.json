Markques Patterson, 29, was grazed by a bullet, and Jacquez Foster, 23, was also wounded, Jones said.\nA fistfight broke out in the club\u2019s lobby before the shooting began, Sheriff David Davis said.\n\u201cAt that point, some individuals pulled out firearms,\u201d Davis said of the episode that lasted maybe five minutes.\nHe said investigators worked all day Friday to identify \u201cthe players, and hopefully we\u2019ll have some (arrest) warrants very soon for those that are involved.\u201d\nMultiple arrests were expected.\nAt an afternoon news conference, Davis showed reporters video-surveillance footage from the club.\nHe narrated a \u201cchaotic\u201d scene where punches were thrown and another, highlighted by flashes of gunfire, where bullets flew.\nIn one clip, salvos of perhaps a dozen shots came from three different handguns.\n\u201cThere\u2019s two places that people that perpetrate this kind of violence wind up,\u201d Davis said. \u201cOne of them is jail, and the other one is hell.\u201d\nDavis said Taylor and Henley likely were innocent bystanders.\nThe other victims, the sheriff said, \u201cmay have been involved in some of the shooting or altercation. ... They may not be completely without blame.\u201d\nHenley, known as D.J. Fresh, was on his way outside when the shooting started, his girlfriend told family members.\n\u201cHe was in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d said Tameka Jackson, Henley\u2019s sister.\nFirst responders tried CPR but could not revive him.\nHe leaves behind a special-needs toddler, who was born premature and is awaiting an intestinal transplant, Jackson said.\n\u201cHe was a very loving guy. My kids loved him because he would get down on their level,\u201d she said.\nTelling her three children that their uncle was dead, she said, was the hardest thing she\u2019s ever done.\nHenley\u2019s mother, who lives in Warner Robins, is holding up the best she can, Jackson said. Henley was a hard-working entrepreneur who had a store in Savannah before moving back to Macon.\n\u201cThese young kids, this violence, it\u2019s senseless,\u201d Jackson said.\nHollingshed\u2019s grandmother said she was too upset to talk Friday afternoon as she sat on her swing in the backyard of the house she shared with her grandson. She saw him Thursday, she said, before he went out.\nThe club\u2019s Facebook page had advertised Thursday night\u2019s \u201cbad a--\u201d dancers and free tequila for the ladies at the DJ booth. The ad also noted there would be \u201csecurity on deck.\u201d\nStrands of Christmas lights wrapped around the lounge\u2019s entryway columns cast a blue glow on the crime scene as detectives and forensic technicians gathered evidence.\nA couple of folded yellow cards marked bloodstains in the middle of the parking lot.\nHenley\u2019s white pickup was parked under the \u201cpole dancing ladies\u201d sign just a parking spot away from the shattered front door.\nA sign taped to the door above an empty bouncer chair read: \u201cWe will call police if anyone is caught with any weapons.\u201d\nAs the sun rose Friday, investigators searched a nearby CVS pharmacy looking for a gun that might have been used in the shooting. Something was found, but deputies did not immediately disclose whether it was a weapon from the club.\nSome posts on the club\u2019s Facebook page were calling for someone to shut it down.\n\u201cHow many have to die?\u201d one man wrote.\nIn July 2011, 35-year-old Alfred Smith was found shot numerous times and fatally wounded in his car in the lounge\u2019s parking lot.\nA prosecutor later said the attack was triggered by a \u201crival gang situation.\u201d\nThere were indications that Friday morning\u2019s gunfire may be the result of a similar kind of dispute, possibly arising from a beef involving the Bloomfield Crips gang.\nDavis didn\u2019t mention gang involvement at his afternoon news conference, but he referred instead to \u201can ongoing situation between a couple of groups.\u201d\nHe said the incident boiled down to \u201cpersonal animosity,\u201d adding that those involved may have clashed at other establishments in recent days.\nAs for Wings Cafe, Davis said the former video store and Quincy\u2019s steakhouse \u201chas been implicated in too many situations. ... This place here has become a hive of hoodlums.\u201d\nA pair of Macon-Bibb County commissioners, Al Tillman and Virgil Watkins, said they will, at a Tuesday Commission meeting, begin the process of trying to shutter the lounge.\nTillman described the place as \u201ca nuisance.\u201d\nDavis said the club\u2019s owner was \u201ccooperative\u201d Friday and had shared video of the ruckus with investigators.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to have his place be the scene of a homicide,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut there are things that are allowed to go on there\u201d that may have led to bloodshed.\nIn May, aspiring rapper Arika \u201cLottie Dottie\u201d Jarrell and her friend Ralph Heard were at Wings Cafe hours before they were killed in an alleged armed-robbery ambush at Jarrell\u2019s house.\nThe four men indicted, and a fifth who was killed in the shootout, Terrance \u201cHeavy D\u201d Dent, allegedly chose their victims while at the club, the indictment stated.\nJarrell\u2019s mother learned about the latest shooting early Friday on Facebook.\n\u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Wings. This is where it all began for my child, the planning to rob her,\u2019\u201d Stephanie Fraley-Jarrell said.\nThe thought catapulted her emotions back to late May when her daughter was shot to death in her car.\n\u201cMy heart is sad because the parents of these young men have to travel the road I\u2019m traveling,\u201d Fraley-Jarrell said. \u201cHow many more kids have to be gunned down in these death traps before somebody does something about it?\u201d\nInformation from Telegraph archives was used in this report.
