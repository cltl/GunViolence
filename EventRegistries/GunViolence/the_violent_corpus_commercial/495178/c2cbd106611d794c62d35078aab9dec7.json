But the party became too large for the woman to control, so she abruptly ended it and began ejecting party-goers from the house.\nLater, a group of males returned and fired gunshots on the street, according to a report from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.\nFour people, ages 16 to 18, were injured in the shooting.\nOne teen suffered a bullet or fragment to her right hand, police said. A bullet grazed another teen\u2019s side. A third teen suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his legs and went to IU Health Methodist Hospital.\nA 16-year-old contacted police Saturday morning to say he also got shot during the party. He left when the police arrived.\nPolice said the investigation is ongoing.\nAnyone with information regarding this crime is asked to call Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at (317) 262-8477.\nCall Star reporter Eric Weddle at (317) 444-6222.
