(WKRN) \u2013 An 11-year-old boy has been charged with criminal homicide in the shooting death of a 15-year-old in north Nashville Friday afternoon.\nPolice said the shooting happened at 3:30 p.m. while the victim, DaVontae Ziegler, was sitting outside his Gwynnwood Drive home. He was with the 11-year-old and another juvenile, all of whom were friends.\nThe 11-year-old told police he was playing with the gun, which he claims to have found, when DaVontae was shot.\nDaVontae ran to a friend\u2019s home nearby on McCarthy Park Lane to ask for help. He was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center where he died during surgery.\nNews 2 spoke with DaVontae\u2019s aunt and uncle, also his guardians. They said they are devastated by the loss.\n\u201cHow come that parent didn\u2019t know that child had a gun? My child is gone now. I have to bury him and I can\u2019t bury my child. I just want him to come home,\u201d explained Amelia Griswould.\nHer husband said the 11-year-old accused in the shooting came over to their home often.\n\u201cHe would come over and play video games. He was over the other day,\u201d said Glenn Griswould.\nThe Griswoulds said DaVontae was a well-liked football player at Hunters Lane High School. Hours before his death, he expressed excitement about getting his driver\u2019s license this year.\nA funeral will be held for the teen next week.\nThe name of the 11-year-old will not be released since he is under the age of 14. He was released into the custody of his parents on Monday.\nThe youth was released to his family because authorities do not see him as a danger to the public.\nA settlement hearing was originally scheduled for April 13, but was continued until July 13.\nWhile Assistant District Attorney Stacy Miller did not want to address the case specifically, she talked about how juvenile defendants are treated differently than adults facing the same charges.\n\u201cThe big thing about juvenile court is that balancing of the public safety with the focus on [the fact that] these are kids. If we want these kids to grow up and have a good life, we need to really focus on what went wrong and how can we fix it, and that\u2019s what we do,\u201d Miller explained, \u201cIf we can allow a youth to leave detention and receive treatment, that\u2019s really what our goal is.\u201d\nMiller said that it was possible for charges could be dropped if the 11-year-old adheres to the treatment and rehabilitation plan laid out for him in the hearing."}
