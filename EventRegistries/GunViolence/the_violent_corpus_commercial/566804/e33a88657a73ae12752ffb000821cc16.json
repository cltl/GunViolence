Police confirm he was 10-years-old.\nThe boy was pronounced dead on the scene. Police identified him as Anthony Harmon Jr.\n\"It\u2019s horrible,\" Crooke said. \"For us to start this holiday weekend off like this, we\u2019ve been throwing things out about water safety all week, not thinking anything along these lines.\"\nThe boy lived at the apartment, according to Crooke. Only kids and young teens were there at the time, with no adults present.\nInvestigators took the kids to an offsite location as they attempted to contact parents and conduct interviews.
