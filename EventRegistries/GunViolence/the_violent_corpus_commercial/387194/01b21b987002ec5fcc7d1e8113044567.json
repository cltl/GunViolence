Prosecutors argued that McAllister turned another attorney away.\nPolice recovered seven .40-caliber shell casings from the scene and obtained video of the car leaving the scene at a high-rate speed, said Cotto.\nLaBrew argued with the judge to set a reasonable bail for McAllister, who is studying social work at Staten Island College, works as a program aide at Public School 32, did volunteer work with special-needs children while at Bishop Ford High School and is the child of a New York State Court officer and MTA Bridge and Tunnel police officer.\nFrederick's attorney, Paul Ascher, argued that only one of six confidential witnesses was able to identify his client in a line-up.\n\"I believe we have the wrong person,\" said Ascher as he urged the judge not to allow Frederick to get photographed in court.\nThe judge remanded both McAllister and Frederick.\nCharges against Wells are pending."}
