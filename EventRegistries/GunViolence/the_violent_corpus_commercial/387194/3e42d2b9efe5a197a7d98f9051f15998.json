She was in critical condition at Lutheran Medical Center on Tuesday, but expected to survive. Houston, in critical condition, was hit once in the midsection, once in the right ribs, once in the left wrist and twice in the buttocks, cops said.\nThe camp counselor was five months pregnant. She hadn\u2019t chosen a name for the baby. She didn\u2019t know the gender.\n\u201cShe has a long road ahead of her, but she\u2019s gonna pull through,\u201d her mother, Tamara Joyner, 41, said.\nInvestigators say three women, including Houston, and two men were hit in the barrage of bullets in Brooklyn. One of the men was the target, a police source said.\nCops late Tuesday arrested two of the three men\u2014the driver and a passenger\u2014who were in an SUV tied to the shooting. Their names weren\u2019t immediately released.\nPolice were still looking for 19-year-old Marquise Frederick who was believed to have been one of the shooters. Frederick, who has three prior arrests, runs with the Ow Ow Crew, who claim the Gowanus Houses as their turf, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. He was gunning for a member of the Gangsta Money Makers based at the Red Hook Houses.\n\u201cWhat we have is two individuals who alight from a car, an SUV, another male driving,\u201d Boyce said. \u201cThey get out of the car and they fire into the crowd.\u201d\nThe five victims were hanging out on the front porch of a Dwight St. residence and eating Chinese takeout just before the shooting, relatives said. Devin Callahan, who is Houston\u2019s boyfriend, had just returned from basketball practice while Houston and a pal had been at a dance class, they said.\nThen all hell broke loose.\n\u201cThere's Chinese food and blood everywhere,\" said Callahan\u2019s 31-year-old sister, Danielle Smith. \u201cWhen I went downstairs everyone was on the floor on top of each other.\u201d\nCallahan shed no light on the shooting when he was released from Lutheran after being treated for gunshot wounds to both thighs.\n\"I'm all right,\" Callahan, 20, said as he left the hospital in a wheelchair. \"I'll be all right.\"\nThe other wounded are:\n- Callahan\u2019s 22-year-old sister, Deanna Smith, who was shot in the leg. She was treated and released from New York Methodist Hospital.\n- Destiny Jones, 19, who was in stable condition at Lutheran.\n\u201cShe's good, just her leg was broken,\u201d friend Sheantty Braddy said. \u201cShe got five in the leg and one in the neck. It just grazed her neck.\u201d\n- Jemini Mitchell, 20. He was also in stable condition at Lutheran after having been shot multiple times.\nThe drive-by shooting on Dwight St. in Red Hook, Brooklyn, left five people wounded late Monday, according to police sources. One of the victims was a pregnant 19-year-old, who lost her child and remains in critical condition.\nMitchell has a prior arrest for assault. Callahan also has arrests on his record, the details of which are sealed.\nCops recovered several .40-caliber shell casings from the scene and believe the shooters used semi-automatic weapons.\nDespite the spate of violence, including 22 people shot over the weekend, officials stressed that overall serious crime was down about 5% citywide."}
