It happened as the child, his sister and older brother were sitting in a truck, parked in their driveway on Charleston Avenue. Today we learned it was their grandfather's truck. Police say the little boy took the gun out of the console of the truck. Investigators believe the gun went off when his 11-year-old brother tried to get the gun to put it away.\nThe incident raises questions about why there was a loaded gun around unsupervised children. Millcreek police are still investigating the facts of what happened. \"Eventually we'll get the information, speak with the district attorney's office to see how we should proceed,\" Detective Captain Scott Heidt said. \"It appears to us it's an accident, obviously we want to make sure we rule everything out.\" Detectives planned to talk to the 7-year-old victim himself. The child underwent emergency surgery at UPMC Hamot on Saturday, where he was listed in stable condition.\nGun sellers at the Erie Sport Store say there are ways to keep kids safe around guns. While it's not against the law to have a loaded weapon in your car, if you have a concealed carry permit, they believe an accident like this one could have been avoided if the gun was in a lock box, had a trigger lock, or was stored separately from the ammunition. \"That is probably the biggest thing, to have that gun locked up with a box or with a trigger lock of some sort,\" said Todd Meeker, Outdoor Manager at the Erie Sport Store. \"Especially around children, they're curious, they just like to look at things,\" he added."}
