Lopez recounted the events during a vigil at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in the Fashion Square Mall.\n\"As the day progressed, and the names started coming out, we realized a lot of the names were of people we knew,\" said Diana Bol\u00edvar, president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Metro Orlando. She points to two of her top staffers at the chamber. \"Mar\u00eda [Garc\u00eda] lost three friends. Ana [Bello] lost two very close friends.\"\nAnd Bol\u00edvar's friend, Adrian L\u00f3pez, a 27-year-old convenience store clerk from Cuba, lost five friends \u2014 and almost his husband.\nThe couple were on the dance floor when the shooting began, and as they dropped to their knees amid a wave of falling bodies, they became separated. L\u00f3pez lay for a while under one of the bodies, then was able to escape out a back door. But when he realized his husband, Javier Nava Coria, from Mexico, was still inside, he went back into the club to try to find him.\nThe two would not be reunited until hours later, when Nava Coria was rescued by police. He had a bullet in his abdomen.\n\"When I saw him, it was the happiest thing of my life,\" L\u00f3pez said."}
