He heard several shots and started crawling military-style into a crowded bathroom stall.\n\"You hear the gunshots getting closer and closer,\" Casiano said.\nCasiano said one man collapsed in front of the stall door, bleeding and begging to come inside.\n\"The door wouldn't open because there's bodies piled up,\" Casiano said.\nCasiano said he was trying to comfort the man, but it was too late. Seconds later, Casiano said, the gunman entered the bathroom and shot him one last time.\nThe scariest part, Casiano recalled, was that the shooter didn't say anything.\n\"He laughed, and as he's laughing, that's when he fires through the whole front of the stall,\" Casiano said.\nTo hear more of Casiano's story of survival, click on the video above to watch Local 10 News reporter Michael Seiden's complete interview."}
