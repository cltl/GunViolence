Investigators say he had been walking on West 53rd Street between Montgomery and Bull Streets when a man driving a car shot him and drove away. Police say this doesn\u2019t appear to be a random shooting.\nAnother incident took place at about the same time, when 22-year-old Cody Youmans arrived at Memorial University Medical Center with a non-life threatening gunshot wound. Youmans was reportedly walking on West 59###sup/sup### Streets also between Montgomery and Bull Strees, when two armed men walked up to him and demanded his property. At that point, Youmans tried to run away but was shot.\nAt about the same time, the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department responded to a report of shots fired on West 61st Street between Montgomery and Bull Streets. This stretch of road was shut down for several hours during the investigation, but at this time investigators have not determined who shot the gun or why.\nAt this time, investigators have not determined if these three incidents are related.\nAnyone with information on this case should contact the SCMPD tip line by dialing (912) 525-3124.\nInformation may also be forwarded to CrimeStoppers at (912) 234-2020. Tipsters remain anonymous and may qualify for a cash reward."}
