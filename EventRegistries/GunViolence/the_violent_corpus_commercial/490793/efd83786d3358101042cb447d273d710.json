And it missed my head and hit me in each arm and in one leg. And I\u2019m still able to walk. I\u2019m still breathing,\u201d said one of the men who was shot but did not wish to be identified in this report.\nHe said they were all sitting around playing when they heard footsteps. Suddenly four men stood over them and demand their money.\n\u201cThere was nothing to give in the first place. But they just said \u2018give it up\u2019. So we just sat there we were looking at each other, is it a joke? And they started shooting at us,\u201d said the man.\n\u201cWe were watching a YouTube video and we heard a few gunshots go off and we immediately just froze for a minute, like what is going on? We thought it was some fireworks,\u201d said neighbor Samuel Jennings. \u201cEverybody was panicking. One dude was shot in the side. He ran inside the house.\u201d\nJoshua Childs, 23, was pronounced dead on the scene. Alphonso Wright, 54, and Christopher Singleton, 35, were taken by fire rescue to Broward Health North.\nRashaad Payne, 23, who immediately ran when the gunfire erupted was driven by a relative to the same hospital. All are expected to survive.\n\u201cIt was crazy because I actually opened up the door and seen one of the dudes lying on the ground. I walked over and looked at the garage and saw another dude lying on the ground. I was like \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe that this really happened\u2019,\u201d said Jennings.\nBroward Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Mike Jachles said the individuals they are looking for should be considered extremely dangerous.\n\u201cThis was nothing short of a brazen attempt of four people who have no regard for human life. They were playing dominoes,\u201d said Jachles. \u201cThey were not bothering anybody. They attempted to rob them.\u201d\nJennings said the shooting really shook him up. He was playing dominoes on Saturday in the spot where the shooting happened. He said it could very well have been him in the hospital \u2013 or worse.\n\u201cI normally have my boys out here and we outside and everything too. So I\u2019m just happy none of my boys was around when this happen because it could have been bigger than it actually turned out to be,\u201d said Jennings.\nUnfortunately none of the three injured men were able to provide a good description of their attackers.\n\u201cThey had skullies on their head and bandanas around their face. I only know that they were all black males and they wore dark clothes. One of them had a big assault rifle and the rest of them had handguns,\u201d said the man.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office hopes someone steps forward and helps them solve this case before it happens again.\n\u201cThey are armed. They are dangerous. We need to get them off the streets. They\u2019ve killed, injured. They can do it again,\u201d said Jachles.\nAnyone with information about the case should call Broward Crime Stoppers at (954) 493-TIPS (8477)."}
