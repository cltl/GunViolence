This is an extremely unusual occurrence, and we're confident that we will make swift arrests.\"\nShannon Roberts, 32, said she was at a hospital, waiting for word about her 21-year-old nephew, who was shot in the arm and stomach, a 37-year-old niece shot in the arm and a 39-year-old cousin hit in the back.\n\"All innocent bystanders got hit,\" Roberts said. \"When I got the call saying they were shot, I wasn't thinking at all, I was just shivering and crying ... just hoping they be alright.\"\nShe called on the shooters to \"turn they self in.\"\n\"The city need to stop the violence. It's hurting our families,\" she said.\n\"Mothers should not have to be crying any day no less Mother Day.\"\nSerpas said there were about 300 to 400 people participating in the Mother's Day second line brass band parade.\nHe said the victims included three or four people who were in surgery, but he did not know their conditions.\nSerpas said three people were seen running from the shooting scene.\n\"We can tell you without a doubt that we will find these guys,\" he said. \"We will bring them into custody and make them pay for the crimes they committed today.\"\nNOPD investigates shooting at mother's day second line on Elysian Fields and Villere.
