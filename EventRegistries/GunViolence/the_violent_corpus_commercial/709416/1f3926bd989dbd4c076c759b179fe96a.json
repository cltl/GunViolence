As Alexa Green reports, attorneys say the men had a longstanding history with one another.\nSYRACUSE, N.Y. -- It's not yet clear what exactly happened that led up to the shooting death of 26-year-old Jonathan Diaz in Armory Square early Thanksgiving morning as defense attorneys and prosecutors painted very different stories Tuesday at Sangsouriyanh Maniphonh's bail hearing.\nAccording to prosecution,Jonathan Diaz had history with Manipohn's wife, and Thursday at the \"The Bar\" in Armory Square, Maniphonh decided to confront him about it.\nThe fight turned physical, with punches and kicks seen on the bar's surveillance video, until the two were escorted out separate doors. But the fight didn't end there. The two met back up on Walton Street and within seconds, shots were fired.\nManiphonh\u2019s attorney argued there was more to the story and that her client was jumped by several men. The prosecution said eye witnesses reported it was a one-on-one fight that turned deadly.\nThe judge ordered Maniphonh to surrender all of his firearms and his passport. Bail was set at $250,000 cash and $500,000 bond.\nThe district attorney's office is looking to present the case to a grand jury on a second-degree murder charge. If convicted, Maniphogn is looking at a maximum of 25 years to life in prison."}
