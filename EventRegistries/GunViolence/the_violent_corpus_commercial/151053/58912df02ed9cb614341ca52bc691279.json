The uncle said his family was in shock and had no idea why the teen was dead.\nIt was Santa Cruz's first homicide of 2014.\nDetectives at the scene told KSBW that the boy was found dead in a bedroom of the second-floor apartment just before 7 p.m. The first 911 call was made by a neighbor.\n\"The victim suffered from an apparent single gunshot wound. The deceased is a resident of Watsonville and was visiting at the apartment,\" Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said.\nAt least six people were inside the apartment when Hugo Rodas was killed, Clark said.\n\"There were several people inside the apartment. The occupants of the apartment were brought to the police department for questioning as detectives worked to determine the role of each person,\" Clark said.\nThe shooting happened so close to the police station, Clark said he thinks the station's surveillance cameras may have captured some of the incident.\nOfficers swarmed the area, secured the area, and said they did not believe a gunman was at-large Monday night.\nThe murder weapon, a 9 mm handgun, was found outside the apartment. The gun had been reported stolen in May after it was swiped from a car that was broken into.\nInvestigators found a car parked outside the apartment with a bullet hole in one of its windows, but they were unsure if the car was connected to Monday night's shooting."}
