Just don\u2019t hurt us,\u201d said Suze Sadler.\nThe Sadlers' 1- and 2-year-old children, as well as their grandmother and an adult cousin were also inside the home.\n\"We were caught off guard. We were in the basement and they came in without us knowing,\" Jabari Sadler said. \"You hear stuff like this happening on TV all the time and in movies, but you never actually think it's going to happen to you.\"\nSadler's wife, Suze, said a man with a gun got control of most of the family downstairs, but while three other robbers were upstairs taking TVs and phones, her mother-in-law was on the third floor calling 911 while hiding under a bed with her infant grandson.\nJarabi Sadler said he knew he had to react quickly when the intruders put their hands on his wife.\n\u201cWhen he started pulling her clothes down, that\u2019s when I lost it, and that\u2019s when I attacked the guy,\u201d said Jarabi Sadler. \u201cSomething just takes over you and you just go into survival mode at that point.\u201d\nJarabi Sadler said he was waiting for the right moment to attack the intruders.\n\u201cWhile they were doing all that shuffling, I realized he wasn\u2019t holding the gun firmly. He wasn\u2019t holding it strong. So I was waiting for a time when I could attack,\u201d Jarabi Sadler said.\nJarabi said the gun went off when he tried to get the gun out of the man\u2019s hand. The bullet went through the man\u2019s leg and left a hole in the bathroom door.\n\u201cI\u2019m holding the gun like this, punching him in the face, kneeing him as much as I could. And he\u2019s like, \u2018OK. I\u2019ll go. I\u2019ll go. Just give me my gun.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018No.'\"\nThe alleged gunman ran out through the front door, ending up in a neighbor\u2019s yard asking for help. Police identified the suspect as 18-year-old David Wilson. Now, they're looking for his accomplices. They're described as two men and a woman who drove off in a dark colored Chevy Impala.\nNo one inside the home was hurt."}
