When we need to be seen, we\u2019ll be seen.\u2019\u2019\nThe avenue had been flanked with cruisers, unmarked cars and the department\u2019s mobile crime unit nearly all day Thursday following an after-midnight shooting that killed one man and injured eight other people at the Trumbull Gardens apartments.\nThere are security cameras on some of the buildings, but police would not say whether any usable images had been captured.\nA young man with a gun isn\u2019t a rare sight at the housing complex, so when one in a hoodie brushed past her in the early morning darkness Thursday, Rhonda Jones wasn\u2019t alarmed.\nIt was only seconds later, when she heard a series of about 20 shots in rapid succession and people screaming, that Jones knew what was happening. The gunfire shattered what had been a night of partying outside the apartments.\n\u201cHe had the gun pointed down at the ground and he was walking really fast when he went by me,\u2019\u2019 Jones, who writes poetry under the name \u201cSpiritual Gangsta,\u2019\u2019 said of the shooter.\nA Shelton man, 37-year-old Savonie \u201cVahnnie\u201d McNeil, was killed. The wounded included Ellen Payton, 59, who wasn\u2019t at the party but in her second-floor bathroom several yards away, taking a shower.\n\u201cBecause of the water running I didn\u2019t hear anything but I felt a burning in my leg,\u2019\u2019 Payton said Friday from behind her screen door. \u201cThere are a lot of bullet holes in here. People fire guns and the shots pass right through.\u2019\u2019\nJones agreed. \u201cThe walls are sheetrock but they\u2019re very thin,\u2019\u2019she said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a problem up here.\u2019\u2019\nShe pointed to several bullet holes in the apartment that McNeil\u2019s grandmother, known as Miss Zany, lived in before her recent death.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Vahnnie was doing up here; they was moving her stuff out,\u2019\u2019 Jones said.\nThe U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force, which includes members of the Bridgeport Police Department, is assisting in the investigation, officials said.\nU.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he would work to secure more federal funding for the neighborhood and for Bridgeport \u2014 including more cameras, more manpower, program support and other resources.\n\u201cI am on the Judiciary Committee. I have a direct line to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch,\u2019\u2019 Blumenthal said. \u201cThe federal government stands with Bridgeport, and we\u2019ll get them the resources they need. But we\u2019ll take our cue from the city on what the needs are.\u2019\u2019\nBlumenthal and Mayor Bill Finch said the most important step is closing the loophole that allows the purchase of weapons without a background check at gun shows. A federal gun law that mirrors Connecticut\u2019s, with bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, is also key, the men said.\nAlthough such a measure proposed after the Sandy Hook school shootings was defeated, Blumenthal noted that it took nearly 10 years for the so-called Brady Bill, another piece of landmark gun-control legislation, to pass.\nLee Byers, executive director of the Bridgeport Housing Authority, said an increase in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development funding is needed to upgrade security cameras in the sprawling public housing complex.\nMeanwhile, there was glass from several shot-out cars in the Trumbull Gardens parking lot from Thursday\u2019s shootings, including a large chunk of windshield. Jones said that police dug seven spent shells out of her friend\u2019s car, which had been parked in a handicapped spot at the edge of the parking lot.\nTwo victims who were brought to Bridgeport Hospital after the incident remained in fair condition Friday, spokesman John Cappiello said. Another was treated and released on Thursday.\nThe victims still being treated at St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center were in stable condition Friday, spokeswoman Caryn Kauffman said. She would not say how many victims are still in the hospital.\nPolice are investigating a dispute in Norwalk that might be related to the shooting. The U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force, which includes members of the Bridgeport Police Department, is helping with the investigation, officials said.\n\u201cLiterally dozens of detectives are following leads, interviewing witnesses and visiting area businesses to determine if security video exists that will bring us closer to finding these gunmen,\u201d Gaudett said. \u201cInvestigators are working non-stop and won\u2019t rest until we identify these gunmen and bring them to justice.\u201d\nHe asked anyone with information to contact Detective Ada Curet, the lead investigator, at 203-581-5236.\nfjuliano@ctpost.com; @FrankJuliano"}
