I got scared, I screamed and I told him we were going to be OK.\u201d\nMiranda didn\u2019t realize until a short time later that she had been shot twice.\n\u201cShauna told me to sit on the curb because I had a bullet sticking out of my stomach,\u201d she testified. \u201cIt was total chaos, massive noise, people screaming.\u201d\nHamilton, 24, is facing a 12-member jury. He is charged with murder and eight counts each of first-degree assault for the June 11, 2015, shooting spree. The trial began Wednesday morning.\nIt\u2019s a case that arguably propelled Joe Ganim to the mayor\u2019s seat.\nThe shooting came the same day Bill Finch was to announce his re-election bid, armed with a claim that his administration was responsible for a decrease in violent crime in the city.\nInstead, Finch was forced to postpone his announcement, giving Ganim \u2014 who announced that day the opening of his own police substation just outside the Trumbull Gardens housing project \u2014 the upper hand.\nBruce Nelson testified Wednesday that he was shot in the right hip and right leg.\n\u201cAt first I thought it was a firecracker, until people began running,\u201d he said.\nA bullet broke Jared Fleming\u2019s left leg but he was reluctant to talk about it in front of the jury.\n\u201cNo offense to my friend Vahnnie,\u201d he added under questioning by DeJoseph.\nUnder cross examination by Hamilton\u2019s lawyer, Michael Riley, neither Fleming nor Nelson, both who grew up with Hamilton, recalled seeing him at the shooting scene. Neither they nor Miranda said they saw the shooter.\nEllen Payton testified she didn\u2019t see anything. She had been taking a shower in her second-floor bathroom when a bullet came through the wall and struck her in the leg.\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m afraid,\u201d she told the jury.\nPolice Detective Thomas Harper was the first police officer on the scene.\n\u201cIt was one of the most chaotic scenes I have been on,\u201d he testified. \u201cThere was a large crowd of people who were screaming and yelling.\u201d\nHarper said he found McNeil, 37, of Shelton, lying on his back between two parked cars, with a gunshot wound to the head.\n\u201cI requested more officers and ambulances to the scene, and then I started going to other victims,\u201d Harper said.\nTestimony is to continue Thursday morning."}
