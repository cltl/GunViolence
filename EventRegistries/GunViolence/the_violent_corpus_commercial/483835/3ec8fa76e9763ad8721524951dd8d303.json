Botello, 19, and Jose M. Carballido, 20, have pleaded not guilty to murder in connection with the deaths of Samantha Parreira, 16, and Matthew Fisher, 19.\nBoth victims were shot to death March 30, 2013, in the backyard of a party in the 9200 block of Westside Boulevard, outside Atwater.\nJudge Ronald W. Hansen on Thursday held both Botello and Carballido to answer for homicides following a preliminary hearing in Merced Superior Court.\nParreira\u2019s mother, Desiree, said she was pleased with the judge\u2019s ruling to keep both men in custody.\n\u201cI think all the information brought out this afternoon will help put these guys away and will help find peace of both Matthew\u2019s family and for my Sami,\u201d Desiree Parreira said.\nDiane Reis, Fisher\u2019s mother, echoed Parreira\u2019s statements.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re being held responsible for taking my son\u2019s young life,\u201d Reis said outside the courtroom. \u201cMaybe we finally see some kind of closure.\u201d\nInvestigators from the Merced County Sheriff\u2019s Department testified during Thursday\u2019s preliminary hearing, along with witnesses with information regarding the case.\nDeputies testified that Botello and Carballido were both members of an Atwater street gang. Investigators said both men attended the party and said multiple people from other rival gangs were also at the party. Deputies believe Botello rushed toward Fisher in the backyard and opened fire, striking Fisher and Parreira, who was seated close to Fisher at the time of the shooting.\nDeputies testified that Carballido was next to Botello during the shooting. They described Carballido as possibly serving as a lookout for Botello during the violence.\nRobert Wynne, Carballido\u2019s attorney, said his client did not know Botello was armed and was not aware of any plans to confront gang members at the party.\n\u201cMy client was just standing there,\u201d Wynne said.\nBotello\u2019s attorney, Ty Kharazi, said Botello\u2019s arrest remains a case of mistaken identity.\n\u201cThere are two witnesses who are in Southern California that say our clients didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Kharazi said. \u201cWe\u2019re conducting further investigation, but they didn\u2019t do the shooting.\u201d\nOne other man was killed during the same party, but deputies have said his death was unrelated to the slayings of Fisher and Parreira.\nBernabed Hernandez-Canela, 18, was shot and killed in front of the house, apparently while multiple guns were being fired and dozens of people were fleeing the scene, authorities have said.\nHernandez-Canela\u2019s death received additional scrutiny last year when Ethan B. Morse, son of Merced County District Attorney Larry Morse II, was charged with murder in connection with the homicide. Morse was accused of driving a getaway vehicle while his co-defendant, Jacob Tellez, was charged with shooting Hernandez-Canela.\nMorse and Tellez, however, were found innocent in November after a preliminary hearing before Hansen, the same judge who handed down Thursday\u2019s ruling.\nBotello and Carballido remain in custody at the Merced County jail without bail. They are scheduled to return to court June 19.\nRob Parsons: (209) 385-2482"}
