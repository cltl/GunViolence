He just kept saying he didn\u2019t mean to. It was an accident,\u201d said Nia, 15, who had slept over Wilta\u2019s Far Rockaway apartment the night before and witnessed the tragedy.\nWilta\u2019s mother Miatta Teage, 39, was inconsolable when reached by phone Saturday.\n\u201cShe was very good, I don\u2019t know what went wrong.\u201d she said, sobbing uncontrollably.\n\u201cI am angry because people are walking around with guns. All kinds of people on the street have guns\u201d\nThe horror unfolded just after noon Friday inside Wilta\u2019s seventh-floor apartment on Collier Ave., officials said.\nWilta, who also went by the nickname Taya, skipped school Friday to avoid a fight, Skrine said. Wilta\u2019s mother was at work, so she decided to invite two boys, both 15, over, according to Nia.\n\u201cShe let them in,\u201d Nia said. \u201c(Wilta and the shooter) were play fighting and he just pulled it out and he shot her.\u201d\n\u201cI couldn't believe it,\u201d Nia added. \u201cI kept touching her and she wouldn't wake up.\u201d\nNia, still dressed only in her undergarments from the sleepover, ran out of the apartment and began pounding on neighbors\u2019 doors for help.\n\u201cShe came to ask to use my phone to call the police,\u201d said building super German Tejata.\nTejata raced up to the apartment and found Wilta unconscious in her bedroom.\n\u201cShe was halfway in bed and on the floor,\u201d he said.\nThe doomed teen died at St. John\u2019s Hospital early Saturday, police said.\nSurveillance footage showed one of the boy\u2019s fleeing in the moments after the shooting, according to the super. The second boy whispered something in Nia\u2019s ear before also dashing off, the super said.\nCops caught up with the boys and charged both of them with manslaughter, weapons possession and tampering with physical evidence. The two were charged as minors, officials said.\n\u201cWe were all friends and it was an accident,\u201d Nia said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to them but they\u2019re gonna have to suffer the consequences.\u201d\nWilta, who attended nearby Middle School 53, had just moved into the building over the summer, neighbors said.\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Nia said. \"That was my best friend. That was like my sister.\u201d\nTeague knew that her daughter had a sleepover and was skipping school on Friday.\nTeague said she immigrated from Liberia to the U.S. in 1999 so Wilta \u2014 and later Wilta\u2019s 7-year-old brother Maxwell could be born American citizens.\nThe proud mom hoped Wilta would have a better life than she did, she said.\n\"They took away my American dream,\" she cried."}
