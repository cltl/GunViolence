He faced no significant consequences \u2014 yet he couldn\u2019t let the matter go.\n\u201cHe possibly took his motives to the grave,\u201d said Carl Zogby, a Hialeah police spokesman.\nVargas was born in Havana on Oct. 3, 1970, the only child to teachers who lived on 16th Street in the city\u2019s Vedado suburb. To many in his family he was known as Albertico. His father, who taught literature, died in 1991 or 1992, according to testimony Vargas gave in a July 23 deposition.\nBetween 1990 and 1994, Vargas studied at the University of Pedagogical Sciences in Havana, graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in technical education with a focus on construction, transcripts show. His best grades were in English and physical education.\nHe briefly lived with a girlfriend, though they never married. After his father\u2019s death, Vargas and his mother moved in with his grandmother, a relative of Patterson\u2019s said.\nThe family that moved into their vacated Havana apartment complained about how filthy it was, asking if the previous tenants had kept pigs in the bathroom, according to a former Vargas neighbor in Havana who asked not to be identified.\nVargas\u2019 mother won a U.S. visa lottery in 1995 and left for Miami, where she had a sister. Vargas himself won the same lottery two years later and moved to Miami on May 2, 1997. He was 26 years old. Mother and son eventually became U.S. citizens.\n\u201cIt was just lucky,\u201d Vargas said in the deposition. \u201cWe wanted, like everybody, to leave Cuba and come here, looking for freedom and better possibilities, work.\u201d\nIn 1999, Vargas and his mother moved into the one-bedroom Hialeah apartment at 1485 W. 46th St. where they would live for the next 14 years.\nHe began taking classes at Miami Dade College, graduating in 2004 with an associate\u2019s degree in graphic design and a 3.5 grade-point average.\nAs a student, Vargas worked briefly at a now-shuttered print shop and interned at the University of Miami, where he helped design a media guide for an athletic team. Even then he cared for his mother, a former UM intern coordinator said Friday, describing Vargas as an intense perfectionist.\n\u201cHe was extremely mature and responsible,\u201d said the coordinator, who asked not to be identified.\nUpon graduating in 2004, Vargas went to work for the media services department at MDC\u2019s North Campus. Yet he continued to live with his mother, splitting rent and utility expenses, Vargas testified in the deposition.\nHe slept on the couch most nights, though sometimes he slept next to his mother in the only bed in the apartment.\n\u201cThey lived in their own world,\u201d said the mother\u2019s relative, who asked not to be identified. \u201cShe adored her son. To her, he was such a good young man, he loved her so much.\u201d\nPost-it notes\nTwelve numbered Post-it notes found in Vargas\u2019 apartment last week appeared to be a storyboard, perhaps for his planned screenplay.\n\u201cLouie\u2019s home,\u201d one of them says. \u201cVery Spartan. Louie f--- the whore ... Louie ask her to stay she refuses unless he pays for the rest of the night. Louie insults her.\u201d\nThough Vargas dreamed of buying his own house, the relative said, he didn\u2019t want to leave his mother, particularly after she had knee surgery. Yet she had been on a Miami-Dade waiting list for public housing for herself since 2008, records show, and had applied for housing assistance on seven occasions in Hialeah since 1996, wanting her son to build his own life.\nBank statements obtained by El Nuevo Herald show Vargas had more than $92,000 in a savings account a year ago. But he lived poorly in a dingy apartment with aged furniture and often wore dirty clothes to the several local LA Fitness gyms he frequented to lift weights for hours.\nA gym acquaintance, Jorge Bagos, said the bald Vargas once complained he lost his hair through steroid use. A toxicology screen performed as part of his autopsy is pending.\nVargas had a concealed weapons permit and owned a Glock 9mm semiautomatic pistol he carried with him when he drove at night, he said in the deposition. He didn\u2019t explain where he went, noting only that he did not frequent bars.\nHis career at Miami Dade College went smoothly at first, according to his personnel file, which includes his Cuban and American college transcripts. In work references, colleagues described Vargas as hard-working and talented.\n\u201cPedro\u2019s work is top-notch,\u201d wrote one of his graphic design instructors, Elio Arteaga.\nArteaga, who now works at DeVry University in Broward, remembered Friday that one assignment required students to design a \u201cDVD interface\u201d for a movie of their choice. Vargas picked The Matrix and designed realistic illustrations of its characters.\nBut despite his talent, said Arteaga, who was visited Thursday evening by Hialeah police digging into Vargas\u2019 past, Vargas \u201cwas a little bit socially awkward.\u201d\nOther co-workers called Vargas quiet and buff, often drinking protein shakes at lunch.\nVargas\u2019 performance evaluations were positive until his last year on the job, when a new supervisor wrote that Vargas was difficult to work with.\nHe \u201clacks social skills,\u201d Elmo Lugo wrote. \u201cIt is hard for him to accept change.\u201d\nVargas responded with a letter saying his job description had been unfairly expanded to include managerial work. Attached were three emails from MDC employees who lauded Vargas\u2019 graphic design work.\n\u2018A 2nd personality\u2019\nBut Vargas didn\u2019t get along with everybody, said Nick Murrell, who used to organize special MDC events for which Vargas designed printed materials.\n\u201cHe was always very cordial to me, very polite, very respectable,\u201d Murrell said. But with colleagues he didn\u2019t care for, Vargas could be \u201cabrasive, rude and curt.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a second personality that was evident,\u201d he added. \u201cBut just because somebody is a little off doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to go and shoot somebody. I never would have believed that he was capable of something so horrible.\u201d\nVargas was forced to resign in 2008 after MDC found he had downloaded inappropriate files from the Internet, including several related to sex and seduction and a computer hacking tutorial that linked to the Anarchist Cookbook, a manual for assembling homemade explosives. Vargas disputed the allegations.\nSeveral months after his resignation, at least two of his former MDC supervisors reported receiving anonymous threats via email, texts and Facebook. Though they suspected Vargas, police were only able to trace the messages to a Hialeah public library.\nVargas then went to work as a graphic designer for another Miami company, but was fired after three months.\nEmployees from that firm also received anonymous emails, according to a source familiar with the case. Managers suspected the recently fired Vargas, but police were unable to identify the emails\u2019 origin.\nIn May 2012, Vargas, through a temp agency, began working at Bullet Line, a promotional products company. He was let go in October after Bullet Line said it no longer had enough work to require Vargas\u2019 services.\nWeeks later, several Bullet Line employees began receiving troubling messages. The company reported the problem to police \u2014 and hired an attorney, Angel Castillo Jr., to investigate.\nCastillo sued Yahoo to try to determine the anonymous user sending the emails. Through the lawsuit, he obtained records from the John F. Kennedy Library in Hialeah, where the emails originated.\nCastillo looked for former Bullet Line employees who used the library\u2019s computers on the days the emails were sent. Vargas\u2019 name popped up most frequently.\nSeveral hours into his July 23 testimony, Vargas admitted to authoring the messages. Castillo told him he would close the case if Vargas wrote an apology to his former co-workers and promised not to send any more messages. Vargas sent the apology four hours later.\n\u201cIt is time for me to show maturity and a promise not to repeat this mistake ever again,\u201d he wrote.\nBut Vargas continued to worry about the case. He told his mother he feared losing his money, the mother\u2019s relative said.\nAt 1:37 p.m. on July 26, a perturbed Vargas called 911 to report someone was following him and he was the victim of brujer\u00eda \u2014 sorcery \u2014 that had begun with Castillo. Before that, Vargas had only once crossed Hialeah police\u2019s radar, in May 2012, to report stolen hubcaps.\nHis mother told 911 her son had been acting strangely. She thought he needed a psychiatric evaluation. Police dispatched two officers but called them back after the mother said Vargas had left with a container to buy gasoline.\nVargas visited the Kendall office of Castillo, who was out. Police believe Vargas was intent on killing the lawyer.\nWhen Vargas returned home, carrying the gasoline and a bag full of cash, he set fire to the money. His mother suffered burns trying to put out the flames with her feet. The smoke prompted 911 calls and a visit to apartment 408 from the building\u2019s husband-and-wife managers, Italo and Samira Pisciotti, 79 and 69, respectively.\nVargas shot them dead.\nParamedics and police officers pulled up outside minutes later. Vargas shot at them from his balcony but missed, instead hitting 33-year-old Carlos Gavilanes, who was entering the building across the street. He died next to his unharmed 9-year-old son.\nVargas then made his way to apartment 304, kicked in the locked door and killed Patricio Simono, 64; his girlfriend, Merly Niebles, 51, and her daughter, Priscilla Perez, 17. Priscilla had been hiding in the bathtub.\nIn apartment 523, Vargas took Sarrida and Zoeb Nek hostage. Police negotiated with him for four hours before charging in, killing Vargas in a gunfight and rescuing the hostages.\nVargas, wearing a white undershirt, blue plaid long-sleeved shirt and jeans, was trying to reload his pistol, police said, and had two full magazines of ammunition.\nHis mother, the relative said, has been hospitalized and is devastated.\n\u201cShe carries the pain of her son, but also the pain of the people who died,\u201d the relative said. \u201cShe\u2019s crying all the time.\u201d\nOn Friday, nearly a week after the shooting, Vargas\u2019 body lay in the Miami-Dade medical examiner\u2019s office.\nNo one had claimed it for burial.\nMiami Herald staff writers Joey Flechas and David Ovalle, and El Nuevo Herald staff writers Enrique Flor, Julio Menache and David Noriega, contributed to this report."}
