Investigators arrested Fritch's boyfriend, 21-year-old Jesse Dobbs outside of the bar early Wednesday morning.\nAuthorities issued an amber alert for Fritch after her mother and younger sister were found dead in their Baytown home. Police say Dobbs is a person of interest in the case.\nInvestigators say Dobbs is refusing to cooperate and won't give them any information on Fritch's whereabouts.\n\"We need her home,\" said Fritch's grandmother, Barbara DeRamus. \"This is a mother and grandmother's worst nightmare.\"\nDobbs started dating Fritch after they met online and moved into the family's house, according to DeRamus. She says Fritch's mother wanted him out.\n\"He just seemed like a lowlife,\" she said. \"I thought what was Kirsten doing with this idiot.\"\nTuesday morning, police found Fritch's younger sister, Breanna Pavlicek, 13, and their mom, Cynthia Morris, 37, dead with gunshot wounds in the family's Baytown house.\n\"I believe he murdered my daughter and my innocent 13 year old granddaughter,\" said DeRamus. \"I hope he rots in hell.\"\nPolice have not charged Dobbs with the murders. He is currently being held in the Texas City jail on charges of resisting arrest.\nThe Amber Alert describes Kirsten as a white female, 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighing 135 pounds with brown hair and green eyes.\nAnyone with information about this case is asked to contact Baytown Crime Stoppers at (281) 427-8477 or The Baytown Police Department at (281) 422-8371.\n(\u00a9 2017 KHOU)"}
