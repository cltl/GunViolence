This time, their parents were left at home. The older brother got into the water-but the younger boy went back to get the gun and accidentally shot himself. Neighbors then say the 11-year-old tried to save his brother, desperately getting the attention of neighbors for help.\nNeighbors say the 11-year-old, who was questioned by detectives long after his brother was airlifted away, used an emergency vehicle to drive to a nearby home to find an adult to help.\nThe boy is in critical but stable condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital.\nAn investigation is ongoing."}
