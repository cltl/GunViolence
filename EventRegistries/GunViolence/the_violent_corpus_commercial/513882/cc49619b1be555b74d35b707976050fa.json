He was missed,\u201d teacher Kristin Beaudua said.\nGrief counselors were at the high school Tuesday, holding group counseling sessions for students on campus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful, because you see what they could be. He doesn\u2019t reach his full potential, and he had so much of it,\u201d Beaudua said.\nGuidance counselor Marlene Ogle said Fulton was interested in boxing, was a good student and was bringing his grades up.\n\u201cHe was very fun-loving, smiled, very respectful,\u201d Ogle said. \u201cJust a really great kid.\u201d\nFulton's stepmother, who lives in Tampa, said they called him Cleve.\n\u201cI was hurt. He\u2019s my son, even though he\u2019s not my real child. I\u2019ve had him since he was 2 years old,\u201d Doria Fulton said.\nCleveland moved to Palatka last summer to be with his mother. His father and stepmother said they are devastated and wish he hadn't moved away.\n\u201cHe just liked to play around and joke with his friends, just have fun,\u201d Doria Fulton said. \u201cWe all loved him. He was a sweet child, always my sweet boy.\u201d\nPolice said Cleveland and several other friends got together after school at a friend\u2019s house.\nSomehow, the teens got hold of a handgun and Cleveland either accidentally or intentionally shot himself in the head.\nThe other teens called police, and Cleveland was taken to the Putnam Community Medical Center and then flown to Shands Hospital in Gainesville in critical condition.\nThe Palatka Police Department is still investigating the incident.\nPolice said they aren\u2019t sure who the gun belongs to, but at this point, they said nothing about the case looks criminal.\nCopyright 2016 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved."}
