The driver was uninjured, but a bystander was hit by gunfire and hospitalized.\nScroll down for video\nAccording to police, Syed told one of the men: 'I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I killed somebody. Today\u2019s my last day, give me your keys.'\nBetween 5.30am. to 5.55am, Tustin police received numerous calls about shootings in several locations, he said.\nThe first call that came in was at Red Hill Avenue and Interstate 5, where a truck was stolen from a Mobil gas station.\nAfter that carjacking, Syed then began spraying the freeway with bullets, hitting several drivers.\nThree people reported being targeted, including one who suffered a minor injury, Tustin police Lt Paul Garaven said. Two cars were damaged.\nWhen the truck got low on gas a short time later, Sayed stopped at State Route 55 and McFadden Avenue in Santa Ana, where he forced the driver out of the car, killed him, and took his BMW.\nThe driver was identified as business owner Melvin Lee Edwards, 69, who was on his way to work when he crossed paths with Syed. Santa Ana police Cpl Anthony Bertagna said: 'He was basically executed. There were at least six witnesses.'\nThe shooter then drove to a Tustin Micro Center electronics store and carjacked another small truck, after killing its driver, identified as 26-year-old construction worker Jeremy Lewis of Fullerton.\nWhen another worker at a nearby construction site approached Syed, the gunman told him to run - and with his back turned - Syed shot him, striking him in the arm. He then drove off.\nBut his shooting and car-stealing spree ran came to an end as officers from the California Highway Patrol located Syed and followed him into the city of Orange, Garaven said.\nOrange County sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said: There wasn\u2019t a confrontation at that very end. It happened so quickly.'\nHe pulled into the intersection of Katella Avenue and Wanda Road, exited the still-moving vehicle, where he quickly shot himself in the head with the same shotgun.\nThe motive for the shootings is still unclear.\nTustin is about 35 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.\nWatch video here"}
