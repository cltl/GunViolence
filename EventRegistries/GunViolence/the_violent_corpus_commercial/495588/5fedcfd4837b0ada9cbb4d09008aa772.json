A police source who asked not to be identified because the matter is under active investigation said the man stepped back and shot Daniel and Clervoyant outside the bar.\nA 27-year-old Irvington man and 34-year-old East Orange man were also shot and taken to University Hospital. Their names were not released.\nOutside the Hillside home of Woodley Daniel yesterday afternoon, at least a dozen friends and relatives gathered, crying and hugging each other.\n\u201cWe were born several days apart,\u201d said Noah Joseph, 32, a cousin. \u201cOur mothers carried us in their wombs at the same time.\u201d Joseph said Daniel was originally from Irvington and had moved to Hillside.\n\u201cHe was very loved,\u201d Joseph said, voice cracking. \u201cHe had many nieces and nephews and he was a father to all of them. He was a good man with a heart of gold. Anyone who knows him will say that about him. He was a protector. He was a hero.\u201d\nPierre Clervoyant Sr., who owned Slick\u2019s, said two men came to the bar at around 12:30 a.m. He said they were denied entry because \u201cthey were clearly drunk.\u201d His son approached the men \u201cto calm the situation down,\u201d as their argument with Daniel moved outside. One of the men then pulled out a gun and fired, he said, killing Daniel and Clervoyant Jr., wounding two others and fatally shooting Cureton.\n\u201cHe was trying to be the peacemaker,\u201d said Stephanie Clervoyant, 25, the sister of the bar manager. She wore his New York Knicks pullover, gathering along with other family at their Elizabeth home.\nClervoyant lived upstairs from his parents with his wife, Candice Clervoyant \u2014 a maternity nurse at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston \u2014 and their daughter Jaidyn, who turned 6 on Sunday.\n\u201cEveryone knew Pierre because of his smile,\u201d she said,\u201d calling him a mentor to youth in the Haitian community. \u201cHe was better than a great father,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was excellent. He was kind and compassionate.\u201d\nA Facebook account for Clervoyant, a graduate of Fairleigh-Dickinson University, has a photo of his daughter as the profile picture. She sits on an ottoman, wearing flower barrettes in her hair. On both Instagram and Facebook, messages mourned the bar manager. \u201cMy prayers and condolences goes out to my Slicks family in Irvington,\u201d read one post. \u201cSuch sad news to wake up to this morning on a day like this.\u201d\nIn addition to managing the bar, Clervoyant worked for the city of Elizabeth, in the Office of Aging, which runs programs for seniors.\nElizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage, reached by email yesterday, called him \u201cA great young man who had everything going for him.\u201d\nPierre Clervoyant Sr. says police took a computer containing footage from surveillance cameras.\nActing Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray and Joseph Santiago, Irvington Police director, said Irvington Police and the Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office Homicide/Major Crimes Task Force are investigating the shooting. Its Crimestoppers program announced a $10,000 reward for information that would help in the arrest and conviction of a suspect.\nThe Irvington bar has been the scene of at least two other shootings in recent years. Steven Charles, 24, of Irvington, was fatally shot after an argument outside the bar in August of 2010.\nStar-Ledger staff writers Mark Di Ionno and Lisa Rose contributed to this report.\n\u2022 Go-go bar victim in Christmas Day shooting lived in two different worlds\n\u2022 $10,000 reward being offered in Christmas Day go-go bar shooting that left 3 dead"}
