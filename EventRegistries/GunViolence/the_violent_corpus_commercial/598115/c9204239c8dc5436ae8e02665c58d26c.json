The suspect, identified by Dallas Co. District Attorney as 62-year-old Earnest Fells, was reportedly armed with a gun during a domestic dispute. He's alleged to have shot his own mother.\nTwo officers responded to the residence. Once on scene, investigators say the man fired at the officers, with one of the bullets grazing an officer's nose. One of the officers returned fire, fatally wounding the suspect.\nThe female victim was transported to a Montgomery hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. The unnamed officer who was injured was grazed by a bullet on the nose. It wasn't immediately clear if the bullet was direct fire or a ricochet.\nChief John Brock said the officer in question, who has been on the force for two years, is okay emotionally and is currently on leave with pay, a standard procedure. He said, based on what he has seen so far, he fully supports the actions by taken by his police officers.\nOnce the investigation is complete, the findings will be turned over to Jackson's office for review.\nCopyright 2016 WSFA 12 News.
