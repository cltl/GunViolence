The teen was found shot in the chest over the summer at a home in Wasilla, according to an AST incident report.\nThe two people in the room with him at the time of the shooting were Austin Barrett and Damien Peterson, trooper Jared Noll wrote in the report.\nBarrett, 19, is one of the teens charged in connection with the death of David Grunwald. Peterson, 19, is the brother of Devin Peterson, another teen charged in the Grunwald death investigation.\nJust after midnight on June 27, 2016, Noll responded to the shooting, where he found Frank Woodford \u201con the floor of a downstairs bedroom with an apparent gunshot wound to his chest.\u201d\nWhat follows in Noll\u2019s report is an interaction between him and the injured teen:\nI asked [Woodford] what happened and he replied he didn\u2019t know. I asked him again and he stated he didn\u2019t shoot himself. At that point, one of the medics spoke to [Woodford] and stated \u201cYou are not going to survive [t]his, we need to know what happened.\u201d [Woodford] reiterated that he did not shoot himself.\nFrank Woodford was then taken to the hospital, where he later died. When his mother, Michelle Woodford, was finally able to read the incident report last week, she says her grief turned into disbelief.\n\u201cI know he didn\u2019t [shoot himself],\u201d she said of her son. \u201cHe would\u2019ve never done that. When I read that, it upset me. I mean, I know my son wouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d\nThe incident report goes on to detail that both the \u201cproperty custodian\u201d and \u201ca large number of juveniles\u201d were among those in the home when the shooting happened. After hearing the gunshot, the teens initially fled the scene and later returned, the report says. When troopers interviewed Barrett, he said there was a gun on the bed and Frank Woodford asked Peterson if he could play with it.\n\u201c[Barrett] stated he was looking at a tablet when suddenly he heard a boom and [Woodford] was next to him with blood everywhere,\u201d the report states.\nWhen Peterson was later interviewed by troopers, he said Frank Woodford picked up the gun and \u201cthe shot went off about 4-5 minutes later.\u201d\nIn the report, both Barrett and Peterson are classified under the term \u201csuspect.\u201d But troopers also noted, \u201cat this time there is no conclusive evidence of foul play. Case closed pending further investigative leads.\u201d\nAST won\u2019t say exactly what \u201cnew information\u201d is causing them to take a second look at the teen\u2019s death or how that information was was obtained.\n\u201cTroopers will investigate the validity of the information,\u201d said spokesperson Megan Peters in an email Friday. \u201cAt this time we are not providing details regarding the case as it is under review.\u201d\nMichelle Woodford describes the way AST handled her son\u2019s death investigation as \u201cpretty messed up.\u201d\n\u201cTo me, it was like it was just cast aside,\u201d she said of the case. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they do stuff then instead of now?\u201d\nMichelle also notes the connection to the Grunwald case with remorse, adding that a life could\u2019ve potentially been saved.\n\u201cIf [troopers] would\u2019ve done their job, probably this boy wouldn\u2019t have died,\u201d she said of the Palmer teen. \u201cNow that this case is open with Grunwald, all of a sudden they want to start interviewing people. I mean, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s coming to light. I\u2019m really glad for that. And I hope something is done, because I don\u2019t feel justice is served yet.\u201d\nAST\u2019s Major Crimes Unit has taken over Frank Woodford\u2019s case. His mother says she hopes the next update from troopers will be answers to an unexplained death she still has questions about.\n\u201cI miss him so much \u2026 It still feels like he\u2019s going to call every day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not.\u201d\nKTVA 11\u2019s Sierra Starks can be reached via email or on Facebook and Twitter."}
