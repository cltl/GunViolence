Deputy Chief Ken McCabe, of the Kankakee County Sheriff's Department, said the teen later admitted to accidentally shooting himself with a .380 semi-automatic handgun while playing with it in his jacket pocket.\nMcCabe said the teen did not have a FOID card or concealed carry permits. He also said there was not any evidence to support the teen's claim two cars were shooting at each other.\n\"It's not entirely uncommon for people to report someone shot them after they shot themselves,\" McCabe said. \"When you start asking questions, some things just don't line up.\""}
