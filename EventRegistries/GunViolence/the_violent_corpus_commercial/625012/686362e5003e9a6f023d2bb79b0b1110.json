Larry Crowson. \"Right now we're getting conflicting statements about exactly what happened inside the apartment.\"\nAlthough the boy was flown by Lifeflight and taken to surgery, he is expected to survive.\nPolice decided to take the adults who were inside at the time of the shooting to the Mykawa substation to continue questioning so they can figure out exactly how the child was shot.\n2016 Click2Houston/KPRC2"}
