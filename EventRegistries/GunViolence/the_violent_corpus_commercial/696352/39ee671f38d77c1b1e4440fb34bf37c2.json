One person was shot.\nHagerman said the two recent shootings have put the eyes of the attorney general\u2019s office back on the club.\n\"We've got to prove a connection, prove that they aren't doing things they could be doing and in some way they are operating is contributing to the problem,\" Hagerman said.\nWe called Pure Passion to ask management if they were worried if the recent incidents would cause the District Attorney\u2019s Office from stepping in and closing the club again.\nHagerman told FOX13 he has a solution for the club\u2019s management to allow the DAG\u2019s office to help solve the problem of violence before it gets any worse.\n\"In the past we have had situations like this and done interviews like this and have encouraged the owners of these clubs to get in contact with our office as soon as they can,\" Hagerman said.\nFOX13 has learned in the last four months police have responded to 36 calls at Pure Passion.\nThe Memphis Fire Department told FOX13 the fire did not damage the inside of the business. It was contained to the roof, and it\u2019s still under investigation.\nMemphis Police have no one is in custody, and this is still an on-going investigation.\n\u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group."}
