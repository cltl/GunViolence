He confirmed to police that he resided in a Middle Road home with the mom and child.\nMiles reported during the interview that, \u201cAmong his belongings on the floor next to the bed, he keeps a 9-millimeter handgun usually stored in a gym bag or a shoe box. He normally keeps the gun fully loaded without a gun lock or any other safety device,\u201d according the probable-cause affidavit.\nHe told police that he and the child and the child\u2019s mother had been together in the home earlier in the day. Miles reported that he had fallen asleep, and \u201cawakened by the sound of a loud pop and discovered [the toddler] crying and his handgun was close to the child.\u201d\nMiles further told police that upon realizing the toddler had been shot, the couple took the boy to a relative\u2019s home before going to the hospital. He was placed under arrest following the questioning and later booked in the Clark County jail.\nUNRELATED CASES\nMiles has a pending case in Clark County Circuit Court No. 1 after being charged in January with two counts of level 5 felony carrying a handgun and A misdemeanor possession of marijuana. A level 5 felony has a sentencing range of one to six years in the Indiana Department of Correction. A trial date is scheduled in August on the handgun charges.\nIn 2013, Miles was charged in Clark County Circuit Court No. 3 with class A misdemeanors carrying a handgun without a license and dealing in marijuana. He was sentenced to one year probation after pleading guilty to the marijuana charge, and the unlawful possession of a handgun charge was dismissed."}
