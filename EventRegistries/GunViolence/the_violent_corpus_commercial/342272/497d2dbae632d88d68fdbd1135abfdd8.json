They also discovered bullets and loaded the weapon, according to deputies. The gun accidentally discharged, hitting the 12-year-old in the arm.\nPitt County Sheriff Neil Elks says, so far in their investigation it does not appear the gun owner is at fault.\n\"I want the people of Pitt County to know we are responsible for our weapons,\" says Sheriff Elks. \"So we need to make sure we have them in a safe location, and I have no reason to doubt that the property owner did, in fact, do that. He had the weapon put up in a safe location.\"\nA sheriff's office report says the weapon was a shotgun.\nSheriff Elks says the injuries were serious and the boy was having surgery on Monday at Vidant Medical Center.\nElks says there will be no charges filed against the man who owned the gun."}
