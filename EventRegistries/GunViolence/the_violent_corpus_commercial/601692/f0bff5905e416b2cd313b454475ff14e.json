Marginal Way S.\nDetectives obtained a warrant and searched the room where the shooting occurred. After conducting extensive forensic investigation, and interviewing the child\u2019s mother and her boyfriend, detectives believe that the toddler\u2019s injuries were the result of the child handling a loaded handgun, Seattle police said.\nThe department added that detectives will be pursuing a felony weapons violation against the mother\u2019s boyfriend, since he is a convicted felon and not allowed to possess firearms.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated."}
