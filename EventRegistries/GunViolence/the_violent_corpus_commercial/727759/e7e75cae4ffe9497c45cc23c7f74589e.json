But it wasn\u2019t clear just when the shooting happened.\nFour people were found dead with gunshot wounds: a 41-year-old woman, a 19-year-old woman, a 45-year-old man, and a 36-year-old man, according to police. Three were found inside the home, and one of the women was found outside.\nA 2-year-old boy also was in the house. He was unharmed and taken to Roseland Community Hospital for observation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s known that people in the home knew their attackers,\u201d Guglielmi said, adding that no weapon had been found.\nThree of the victims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, and the fourth suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office. All four were ruled homicides.\nA fifth victim, an 18-year-old woman who was also found outside, was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where she remained in critical condition Sunday morning. Detectives had not interviewed her as of Sunday evening, Guglielmi said.\nNeighbors said all of those who were shot are related to each other and lived at that address.\nPolice initially thought the shooting may have stemmed from a domestic situation, but they walked the theory back as more evidence came to light.\nNeighbors said they didn\u2019t hear any gunshots and realized something was wrong only when the police got there.\nA source told the Chicago Sun-Times that a \u201cman ran up to a citizen and said, \u2018Call 911 for multiple people shot.\u2019 \u201d\nMelvin Powell said two of his cousins live in the home where the shooting occurred. He thought at least one was killed because he wasn\u2019t answering his phone all day. He said another cousin who lives there was pregnant.\n\u201cThis is a massacre, man,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWho\u2019d do something like this?\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s shooting was the third time in 24 hours in the city in which at least four people were shot in a single incident.\nMore than 750 people have been killed so far this year, Chicago\u2019s deadliest since the late 1990s.\nContributing: Mitch Dudek"}
