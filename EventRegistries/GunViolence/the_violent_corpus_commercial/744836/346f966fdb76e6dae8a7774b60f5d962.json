Police said the suspects then walked up the vehicle and attempted to rob them.\nBuckley said when the 14-year-old told the guards \u201cgive me everything you have,\u201d the suspects were shot by the male sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle.\nThe guard fired at least four shots, striking one suspect in the chest twice and hitting several vehicles in the car lot across the street, said Buckley.\nOne of the suspects shot was 29-year-old Seth Easley, police said. The 14-year-old was a student at IPS Tech High School. The Marion County Coroner says the teen's death was a homicide and he was shot three times in the torso.\n\u201cThroughout all of this you have to have respect for the deceased, no matter what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Buckley. \u201cI was very proud that the police department treated both of the suspects with dignity but I am very disheartened with society. We can do a lot better. There is something wrong when we have 14-year-old kids\u202614-year-old kids should be home.\u201d\nThe two guards were interviewed by police but then released.\nBuckley said the gun used by the 14-year-old during the attempted robbery was stolen from Greenwood. He does not believe the guards will face any charges.\nDuring the incident that happened outside of The Grove, the business continued to operate as normal.\n\u201cI was very disappointed with The Grove tavern because they continued to do business when there is two people laying out in the street,\u201d said Buckley.\nThe names of the guards have not been released by police.\nIf you have any information on this case, call Crime Stoppers at (317) 262-TIPS.\nCopyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.
