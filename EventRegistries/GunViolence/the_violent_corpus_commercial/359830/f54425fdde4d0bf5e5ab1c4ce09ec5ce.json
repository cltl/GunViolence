He waived extradition and was flown to Charleston on a state plane. He landed at Charleston International Airport and was whisked to the county jail for booking.\nBut the public\u2019s first glimpse of the shooting suspect had come earlier in the morning when police circulated surveillance photographs.\nThe photos showed a thin white man with a bowl haircut enter the wooden doors of Emanuel AME Church at 8:16 p.m., after parking a dark-colored Hyundai. The shooting happened about an hour later.\nCarson Cowles, 56, told Reuters by phone that he recognized the man in the surveillance photo as his nephew. \u201cThe more I look at him, the more I\u2019m convinced, that\u2019s him,\u201d he said, adding that he believed the shooter\u2019s father had recently given him a .45-caliber handgun as a birthday present.\n\u201cNobody in my family had seen anything like this coming,\u201d Cowles also told Reuters. \u201cI said, if it is him, and when they catch him, he\u2019s got to pay for this.\u201d Cowles said he had told his sister, Roof\u2019s mother, several years ago that Roof was too introverted. \u201cI said he was like 19 years old, he still didn\u2019t have a job, a driver\u2019s license or anything like that and he just stayed in his room a lot of the time.\u201d\nRoof lived in Eastover, a rural town between Columbia and Congaree National Park. Police gathered by the two-story log house Thursday. An American flag hung over the entrance. When a reporter approached, a man inside the house said he would call deputies if the reporter didn\u2019t leave.\nBut a picture of a troubled young man began to emerge of Roof, based on reports from friends, two arrests and the digital trail he left on social media sites.\nOn his Facebook page, he listed his high school as White Knoll High School in Lexington County about 40 miles west of Eastover. Lexington County officials said that he dropped out of White Knoll in February 2010, when he was in the 10th grade. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether he transferred to another school.\nHis life took a turn on Feb. 28 when he was arrested at the Columbiana Centre mall. Employees there called police after Roof asked questions about the number of employees in the stores and when the stores closed.\nOfficers then found Roof wearing all-black clothes and carrying a pill bottle of Suboxone, a painkiller used to treat opiate addiction. The arrest affidavit said that Roof admitted that he didn\u2019t have a prescription for the drugs.\nHe was banned for a year from the mall, but on April 26, Columbia police arrested him again at the mall, this time on a trespassing charge. He was fined $262.50.\nOn May 21, Roof\u2019s Facebook profile picture changed to one of him standing in a swamp of bare cypress trees covered in Spanish moss. He had a mop-top haircut and looked straight ahead at the camera with a frown. He wore a black jacket with two flag patches on the right front. One flag was the old South African flag that was flown during Apartheid; the other was the flag flown by white-ruled Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. Both flags are known to be symbols popular in white supremacist groups, experts say.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center also found a photograph of Roof sitting on the hood of a Hyundai with a \u201cConfederate States of America\u201d tag.\nA friend, Joseph Meek Jr., said Roof told him recently that black people were taking over the world and that something needed to be done for the white race. The two had been best friends in middle school but lost touch when Roof moved away about five years ago. They recently reconnected, Meek said, adding that Roof\u2019s racial comments came completely out of the blue and that he could tell something was troubling his friend.\nMeek told The Associated Press that when he woke up Wednesday morning, Roof was at his house, sleeping in his car outside. Later that day, Meek went to a nearby lake with a couple of other people, but Roof hated the outdoors and decided he\u2019d rather go see a movie.\nDalton Tyler told ABC News that he had known Roof for a year. \u201cHe was big into segregation and other stuff. He said he wanted to start a civil war. He said he was going to do something like that and then kill himself.\u201d\nOthers were shocked over the news of the shooting and his arrest. \u201cI never thought he\u2019d do something like this,\u201d high school friend Antonio Metze told The Associated Press. \u201cHe had black friends.\u201d\nKimberly Konzny, Meek\u2019s mother, said she didn\u2019t know why Roof was in Charleston and was not aware of his being involved in any church groups or saying anything racist. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was going through his head,\u201d Konzny told the AP. \u201cHe was a really sweet kid. He was quiet. He only had a few friends.\u201d\nJohn Mullins, who went to high school with Roof, told The Daily Beast that he remembers him as being \u201ckind of wild\u201d but wasn\u2019t considered an outcast. Mullins said that Roof had a reputation for making racist statements and had \u201cthat kind of Southern pride, I guess some would say \u2014 strong conservative beliefs. He made a lot of racist jokes, but you don\u2019t really take them seriously like that. You don\u2019t really think of it like that.\u201d\nCynthia Roldan and Diane Knich of The Post and Courier and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}
