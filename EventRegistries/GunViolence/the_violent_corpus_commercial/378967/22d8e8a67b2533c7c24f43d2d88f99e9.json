Somehow, family members said the 6-year-old obtained a loaded gun kept inside the home for protection. When the child began playing with the gun, the 6-year-old accidentally shot his younger brother, according to police.\nWhile Mobile Police did not confirm where the child was shot, scanner traffic indicated the child was shot in the head.\nThe shooting happened Monday afternoon at the child's home on Border Circle North in West Mobile, according to police.\nPolice responded to the home around 1:25 p.m. Monday, July 20. Upon arrival, the first responding officer determined the child needed immediate medical care. So the officer took the child to Providence Hospital in a patrol car.\n\"The child definitely needed care urgently, and it would have taken longer for fire rescue to get here than for the officer to just load the child in the car and actually leave,\" said Officer Terence Perkins with Mobile Police.\nAfter the child was stabilized at Providence, he was taken to USA Medical Center where he was last listed in critical condition.\nPolice said, so far, there are no criminal charges pending, as the shooting was an accident. Officials did not release the name of either of the children involved in the incident."}
