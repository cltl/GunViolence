Kroll-McLaughlin did not enter a plea. His bail was set at $200,000 and he requested a public defender.\nA witness, identified in court records only by the initial J, told investigators that he had been having some issues with Eakin and got into a car with him and Kroll-McLaughlin on the morning of July 7. They drove to an area near the bus station in Helena where the witness said he was \"taken out of the car.\"\nHe said he had his back to a wall and Eakin was leaning next to the car when Kroll-McLaughlin struck him with something in the left cheek, court records said.\nKroll-McLaughlin is charged with deliberate homicide under the felony murder rule, which alleges he was committing felony assault with a weapon when he caused Eakin's death. He also is charged with tampering with evidence for trying to get rid of the gun used in the shooting."}
