Police said he tossed a Keltec 9 mm Luger.\nMore than a month ago, police announced they were searching for the teenager from Penn North. And the community, police said, was helpful in identifying Greene.\nHe's being held without bond at Central Booking.\nThe teenager has been charged with attempted murder, armed robbery, assault, reckless endangerment, theft, also illegally possessing and firing a gun, and more.\nSome of the charges come from the May 23 shooting in Howard Park near Forest Park High School. That afternoon, a 16-year-old boy told police he was walking home with friends when a masked man in a camouflage jacket opened fire. The boy was shot in his thigh and ran home. Police said the gunman was Greene.\nAbout two weeks later, a 17-year-old boy was walking to pick up his cap and gown at Frederick Douglass High School, when someone stuck a gun in his back. The boy and robber struggled. And the robber shot himself then ran away, police said. The boy wasn't hurt. The high school was locked down. Police named Greene as the suspect in that robbery.\nThursday night, officers near Druid Hill Park noticed a man who appeared to be armed on Gwynns Falls Parkway. The man took off, police said, and the officers chased. Once caught, he said his name was \"Tavon Jackson,\" but detectives determined he was actually Kyree Greene, police said.\nHis public defender could not be reached Monday for comment."}
