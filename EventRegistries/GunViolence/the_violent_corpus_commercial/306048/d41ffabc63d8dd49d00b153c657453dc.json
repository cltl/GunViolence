ATF officers were in the area when the call came in and responded to help out.\n\"We're processing the scene at this point, again trying to determine what happened here,\" Mitchell said. \"Certainly our prayers go out to the child's family at this point and friends. It's tragic for our community anytime a young person is in this type of condition.\"\nAnyone with information who has not spoken to police already can call 574-LMPD.\nWLKY will keep you updated with any new details that are released."}
