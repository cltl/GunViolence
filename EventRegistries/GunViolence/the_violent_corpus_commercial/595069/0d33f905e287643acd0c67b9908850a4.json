Fontenot confirms a total of five people were shot. As of Tuesday morning, three were pronounced dead. A 10-year-old boy suffered minor injuries.\nPolice are investigating what events led up to the shooting. They say they are looking for multiple suspects in the case.\nIt's believed three to four suspects opened fire, aiming at one person in particular.

People who've bought or rented expensive new homes just a few blocks from the shooting scene told KHOU off camera they're troubled by what happened. They call it a pattern of crime that doesn't seem to go away and has even caused many to move. For sale signs pop up around the neighborhood all the time.\nPolice say they're getting tips called in, but so far have no motive and no suspect description to pass along. If you have any information, call Houston Crime Stoppers at (713)-222-TIPS.\n(\u00a9 2017 KHOU)"}
