Police say the last round hit her at an angle where the bullet penetrated the skin and rode along the skull stopping before, and above, the ear line.\n\"Certainly whenever you hear somebody is shot, let alone somebody shot in the head, and that really obviously peaks everybody's interest, but from my understanding...where she was struck, she was actually still able To communicate and actually able to walk to the ambulance yesterday, which is a great thing for everybody involved,\" said Lieutenant John Conti of the Niagara Falls Police Department.\nRight now, Falls detectives do not think the shooting was random, but believe the girl was an innocent victim.\nConti said that third bullet was just inches away from this case being a murder. He said most officers have kids.\n\"It does strike a cord being a parent that you could have a 13-year-old shot three times for doing nothing,\" Conti said.\nPolice are asking anyone with information to call them immediately at 286-4553. They are also asking anyone who lives in the area and has a video security system to contact them as well.\n\"Extreme and reckless, to say the least, that you're firing into a house and you don't know whose in there,\" Conti said."}
