They thought it was a toy, according to trooper dispatch posted online Friday.\nOne child unintentionally fired the pistol, said troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters in an email. A bullet struck Custer in the head. The other children ran to get an adult. The family was on scene immediately after the pistol fired, troopers said.\nThe boy was taken to a health clinic in Shungnak, but he needed advanced life support. A medevac was ordered.\nWhile the medevac was en route to Shungnak, troopers were notified that Custer had been declared dead at 12:06 a.m. Thursday. The medevac was canceled, troopers said."}
