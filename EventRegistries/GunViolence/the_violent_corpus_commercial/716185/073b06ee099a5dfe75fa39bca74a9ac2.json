Authorities released a description of the three and information on the minivan that Jennifer Laber was last seen driving, a silver Chrysler Town & Country.\nThe next day, though, the silver van was spotted parked outside a closed sports equipment store in Lone Tree, about five miles from Highlands Ranch. And inside the vehicle were the bodies of Jennifer Laber, Adam, 3, and Ethan, 5.\n\u201cWe certainly did not see this horrific ending that this case has come to today,\u201d said Chief Deputy Steve Johnson of the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to the Denver Post. \u201cWe do not have a lot of answers.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about as bad as it gets,\u201d family spokesperson and neighbor Brandon Tartler told KUSA-TV.\n\u201cAdam and Ethan were little bundles of energy,\u201d Andrew Pena, another neighbor, told the Denver Post. \u201cThey were full of life and really smart. This is a real tragedy.\u201d\nFew details about the deaths and subsequent investigation were released Wednesday, in the hours after the bodies were discovered. But police in a news release said that preliminary information suggested there was \u201cno danger to public at this time.\u201d Authorities also said the boys\u2019 father wasn\u2019t a suspect.\n\u201cA proper background check protocol was followed,\u201d Beals said of the purchase of the gun, which was later located in the minivan.\nPreliminarily autopsy results show that Jennifer Laber died from a single gunshot wound, which evidence suggests was self-inflicted, and that Adam and Ethan each died from a single gunshot wound, Beals said. The manner of death in all three cases was still pending.\nThe Denver Post reported that authorities were not calling the incident a murder-suicide on Thursday but have said there were no suspects.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not ready to put that label on it yet,\u201d Beals said, according to the newspaper.\nPolice found the Glock in the minivan with the bodies. No suspects. PD stopping short of calling case a murder-suicide.\nAuthorities began searching for the trio after a missing-persons report was filed at around 8 p.m. on Tuesday, the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release. Responding deputies learned that Jennifer Laber hadn\u2019t returned home and was last seen with her sons at the school at around 2 p.m. that afternoon.\n\u201cAt the time we were notified,\u201d Johnson told reporters, \u201cthere was no indication that it would come to this horrific ending. There were no red flags.\u201d\nThe bodies were found Wednesday morning, after police in Lone Tree received a call about a silver van outside a vacant store, the agency said in a news release. The caller thought the van was the same one referenced in the missing-persons case.\nOfficers on the scene determined that it was the same vehicle and confirmed that three people were dead inside. The bodies were tentatively identified as Laber and her two sons on Wednesday, according to a news release.\n\u201cThis is a tragic event and we wish it would have had a different outcome,\u201d Lone Tree Police Chief Ron Pinson said in the release. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family and loved ones during this difficult time.\u201d\nThe three deaths left neighbors of the Laber family reeling. The Denver Post this week reported that some brought food trays to the Laber home, and a woman tied balloons to a tree. She also left flowers \u2014 red roses.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of grieving going on,\u201d Tartler, the neighbor, told the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock . . . It\u2019s unfathomable.\u201d\nTartler, who described Adam and Ethan as \u201cloving, joyful, good kids,\u201d was asked about what neighbors were doing, to which he responded: \u201crespecting privacy,\u201d and \u201chelping.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically all we can do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blind-side.\u201d\nThe Denver Post reported that the two boys were \u201cwell liked in the neighborhood.\u201d Pena, a neighbor who spoke with the Denver Post, called their mother \u201ca really sweet person,\u201d saying there wasn\u2019t anything that might indicate trouble or cause concern.\n\u201cHer little boys were full of excitement,\u201d another neighbor, Phyllis Dubas, told the newspaper. \u201cShe was with the children all the time. It\u2019s so very, very sad.\u201d"}
