She had undergone weight loss surgery months before her death, which her husband said ended up furthering her depression because of the saggy skin left over.\nRyan also said that she was a \u201ctremendous\u201d mom, but her motherhood \u201cturned into her greatest source of pain\u201d and said that the only way she thought her pain could be resolved was in heaven.\n\u201cGoing to heaven was just a next step to her,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo as an act to insure [sic] she could provide the best motherhood to her boys, she took them with, painlessly, while they were under a deep sleep.\u201d\n\u201cDepression is a sickness,\u201d Ryan wrote. \u201cIt is coercive and often operates in silence. There is no fault to lay blame.\u201d"}
