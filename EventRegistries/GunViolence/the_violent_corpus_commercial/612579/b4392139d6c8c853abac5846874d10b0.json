She was taken into custody to be questioned. Police have not said if she\u2019s been arrested or charged.\nThe officers fired pepper balls into the car to subdue him and Tyson sped off.\nA pursuit began, and Tyson fired shots and struck an officer after performing a U-turn on Georgetown Road.

Nobody inside the vehicle was injured.\nAn officer in the car took cover and began returning fire. The ensuing gun battle ended with 16 officers firing 200 rounds. An additional 24 officers were on the scene. Tyson was killed.\nInvestigators are still working to determine how many shots Tyson fired during the incident.\nSome reports indicated Tyson was armed with a rifle, but IMPD has not been able to confirm that information. A handgun was recovered at the scene of the final shootout.\nThe officer who was shot was released from the hospital. His injuries were non-life threatening.\nIMPD released audio of the radio traffic during the incident. Listen to it here.\nTyson's family issued this statement regarding the videos posted online:\n\u201cNow we hear that it was pepper balls but never saw a pepper ball pierce a car!!! But what we feel is very important to know is that JT was our family and he\u2019s so much more than the criminal record and the public smears he\u2019s getting right now!!! He was a good husband, brother, uncle and friend to us all that were in his life and the world will never know how special and great he was to a lot of people. Nobody knows how he came to my house EVERYDAY to be a part of my kids life. To wrestle and play with them and to teach them about life and man things that I can\u2019t teach my boys and he took time out of everyday to be here and me, my children and friends will never be the same without him. He was not the person he\u2019s being painted to be!!!! He was a gift to me and my kids and anyone that was blessed enough to be able to spend time around his amazing personality. He had a laugh and smile that would light up a room. And he was my family and I love him and will miss him forever.\u201d"}
