Jerry David Manning was 75.\nOn July 22, Manning was shot multiple times inside the Old Atlanta Road home he had owned for more than 30 years. Manning\u2019s daughter, Rebecca Manning, and her husband, Matthew Kyle Fields, lived with him in the small white home, along with Rebecca\u2019s two sons, Jacob, 9, and Jared Smith, 8.\nAfter a fight with his wife, Fields had left the home the night before, according to the Forsyth County Sheriff\u2019s Office. But he returned shortly after 6 a.m. the next morning and shot everyone in the home, including the brothers as they slept.\nFields then called his mother in Dawson County and told her had shot four people and planned to shoot himself, the sheriff\u2019s office previously said. Fields\u2019 stepfather called 911 to report the shootings.\nWhen deputies arrived at the home, Fields and the two boys were dead, but Rebecca Manning was on the front porch screaming for help. The 37-year-old woman later died at the hospital.\nJerry Manning was critically injured and underwent emergency surgery the same day at North Fulton Hospital. He was never able to return home, but had improved in recent weeks, according to his nephew, Justin Lankford.\n\u201cHe was getting better,\u201d Lankford told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cHe was talking, laughing.\u201d\nLankford said he and other family members were optimistic Manning would recover from his injuries.\n\u201cAt least now he\u2019s back with his family,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a better place. No more suffering, but he will be missed.\u201d\nFuneral arrangements for Manning were pending.\nAfter the shootings, Lankford said his cousin had planned to divorce Fields, and that may have sparked his actions."}
