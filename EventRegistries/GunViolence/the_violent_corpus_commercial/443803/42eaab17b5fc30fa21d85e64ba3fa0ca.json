This shouldn\u2019t be what happens in a compassionate community and yet we are here talking about it again.\u201d\nBiehl detailed that in February a nuisance abatement ordinance was issued for the home. Neighbors appear to have known the home was a drug house, according to officials. The chief confirmed the address is a drug, gun and gang home. Inside, officers retrieved heroin, crack cocaine and pills. A police report obtained by 2 NEWS shows ammunition and at least one handgun was also taken as evidence.\nBiehl explained that nationwide there has been an increasing trend of violence with injuries, often including guns. In Dayton, in May of 2015 the number of incidents involving guns nearly doubled compared to last year. Biehl said the data collected doesn\u2019t reveal why there has been this increase in Dayton.\nThere are no suspects at this time, but several persons of interest.\nAccording to police, Parker was sitting in his living room Saturday night when four bullets went through the home, one striking him in the head. The boy\u2019s death is being ruled a homicide, according to the Montgomery County Coroner\u2019s Office.\nTuesday night a walk was held in the neighborhood and community members upset about gun violence. They were joined by city officials, including Mayor Nan Whaley, and law enforcement officials, including both the Montgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Dayton Police Department.\nThe .5 million project is at the I-70 and Ohio 41\u2026\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
