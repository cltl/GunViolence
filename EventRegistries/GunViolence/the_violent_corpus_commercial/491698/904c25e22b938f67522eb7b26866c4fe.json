They had already been warned by Dallas police that Bowser \"had shot several people in their city,\" says the warrant, including 43-year-old Toya Smith and her 17-year-old daughter Tasmia Allen, who were found dead in Smith\u2019s home in the 7100 block of Long Canyon Trail.\nDeSoto officers found two more dead at Galleria Drive: 47-year-old Zina Bowser, Erbie's estranged wife, and her 28-year-old daughter Neima Williams. One was found downstairs, in the master bedroom. Another was upstairs, in a back bedroom. Says the warrant, Her body was \"hunched over by the closet where the 13-year-old male victim was located.\"\nThat 13-year-old, Zina Bowser's son Chris, was the one who dialed 911.\nPolice say her 10-year-old son Myles identified Erbie Bowser as \"the one who shot him and all the other people in the house.\"\nDallas police say a 17-year-old survivor also identified him as the shooter.\nThe arrest warrant out of DeSoto says Erie Bowser, identified as \"the offender,\" was on the premises when they arrived. But it says nothing about the hand grenade used at the scene, or how he pretended to be one of the victims when police arrived."}
