The 4-year-old girl was taken to the hospital where she later died.\nSgt. Mercedes Fortune with Phoenix PD said it appears the man took the lives of his daughters before taking his own.\nThe children's mother, identified as Carmen, had also called police earlier Sunday, asking for a welfare check on the children. She does not live there and was not present at the time of the shootings.\nCourt records show she had filed an order of protection early this summer against Arismendez.\nTwo other people who live in the house and were there during the incident were questioned by police.\nA GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family.\nCopyright 2016 KPNX"}
