At that point the bullet went into the mom\u2019s head, back of the mom\u2019s head.\u201d\nEMS arrived and transported the child to Riley Hospital for Children in stable in condition. The mother was transported to IU Health Methodist Hospital, where she underwent surgery. Police say she was conscious and alert when she left the scene. She is expected to be okay.\nThe father told officers his 2-year-old son was also in the room, but he was not hurt. FOX59 is told there were a total of six children in the home at the time of the shooting.\nThe father could potentially face a charge of reckless endangerment for leaving a gun accessible where any one of a half-dozen children could find it.\n\u201cWe want to make sure we stress the importance of gun safety,\u201d said Hamer. \u201cIt\u2019s critical. We obviously want to make sure that people, if they have guns in the house, they lock their guns up. Make sure they\u2019re not exposed where children can grab them and reach them.\u201d\nIMPD offered the following gun safety tips to ensure the safest environment for kids:\nTake the ammunition out of the gun.\nLock the gun and keep it out of reach of kids. Hiding the gun is not enough.\nLock the ammunition and store it apart from the gun.\nStore the keys for the gun and the ammunition in a different area from where you store household keys. Keep the keys out of reach of children.\nAccording to a USA Today/AP survey, Indiana ranks seventh in the nation for accidental shootings involving children since the start of 2014.\nIn two-and-a-half years ending this past summer, there were 45 such shootings in Indiana, eleven in Indianapolis, with 29 children wounded and eleven killed. Five adults were accidentally wounded or killed by children with guns.\nSince January 1, 2014, there have been more than 1,000 accidental shootings involving children in the United States and 133 children killed.\n63 of the children shot or killed so far this year were four years old."}
