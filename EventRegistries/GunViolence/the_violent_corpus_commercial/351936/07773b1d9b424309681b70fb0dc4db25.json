(CBSNewYork/AP) \u2014 Three people were found shot to death and a fourth person was injured sitting inside a car on Long Island, and police said Thursday that the suspect was still on the loose.\nThe shooting happened shortly before midnight Wednesday on Davidson Street in Wyandanch.\nThe suspect walked up to the SUV and opened fire, fatally striking the male driver and two female passengers, Detective Lt. Kevin Beyrer said.\n\u201cThey were sitting in the car just talking,\u201d Beyrer said. \u201cA gunman came upon the vehicle, opened fire into the car. The gunman fled in an unknown direction.\u201d\nKilled were 25-year-old William Madrey of Wyandanch, 23-year-old Stephanie Almedina Rivera of Bay Shore and 23-year-old Ciara Smith of Deer Park, police said.\nA third female passenger, whose identity is being withheld, was hospitalized and expected to live, police said.\nEarly Thursday morning, multiple police vehicles lined the roadway and workers from the medical examiner\u2019s office were on scene.\nShortly before 9 a.m., the SUV was towed away, with bullet holes marking the front passenger door and rear driver\u2019s side window. Officers scoured the area with metal detectors and a K-9 unit looking for evidence.\nNeighbor Shafonski Burnette said she came to the scene after hearing rumblings that one of the victims was her friend\u2019s daughter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d the 53-year-old said as she stood at the yellow crime scene tape that cordoned off the block. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here a long time. I\u2019m friends with her mother. They live right around the block.\u201d\nBrunette said the shooting brought back bad memories. Her 14-year-old niece had been killed in a drive-by shooting on the same block a few years ago.\n\u201cNow they\u2019re shooting,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with it.\u201d\nOther neighbors said they regularly hear gunshots and said gang violence and drug activity are common. They said police need to do more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unfortunate, but we live in a rough neighborhood and that\u2019s how it is,\u201d one resident told 1010 WINS\u2019 Mona Rivera.\nPolice said Madrey is a previously self-admitted gang member and investigators are looking into whether gang affiliation played a role in the shooting.\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at 800-220-TIPS.\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2015 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
