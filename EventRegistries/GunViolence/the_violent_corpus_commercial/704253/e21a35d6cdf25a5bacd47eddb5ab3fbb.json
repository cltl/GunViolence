He has not yet been arraigned.\nThe shooting took place Oct. 29 near East 36th and East J streets.\nCharging papers give this account: Officers arrived to find the man in the driver\u2019s seat of a car with a gunshot wound to his leg and a bullet hole in the car door.\nHe initially claimed he was shot in a drive-by. But, at the urging of a friend who was more concerned about getting the man medical attention than concocting a cover story, he soon admitted he shot himself.\nThe men told police a 19-year-old friend took the gun from the scene.\nPolice found the friend nearby and two guns hidden beneath a bush.\nThe gun used in the shooting was stolen in December 2015; the other gun\u2019s serial number had been ground off and could not be traced.\nThe friend, who has numerous juvenile convictions, was taken to an area hospital for concerns about high blood pressure.\n\u201cHe was upset because he knew he had his criminal convictions although he said he believed his gun rights were restored,\u201d records show.\nThat man is charged with first-degree unlawful possession of a firearm.\nStacia Glenn: 253-597-8653"}
