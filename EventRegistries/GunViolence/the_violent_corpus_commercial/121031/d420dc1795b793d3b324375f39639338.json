John Carter, R- Round Rock, whose district includes the sprawling post, said news of a second attack on post was \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\u201cThe knowledge that a soldier could attack another soldier is devastating to the emotional well being of our troops, which is why in the aftermath of this tragedy support for our troops is more important than ever,\u201d he said.\nWe need to rally around the community and provide the safety and security these people deserve,\u201d he said.\nPresident Barack Obama said the government will get to the bottom of what happened.\nMr. Obama said he's following the situation closely, but said that the situation is fluid.\nHe said officials are doing everything they can to make sure everyone is secure.\nMr. Obama said the incident brings back painful memories of the 2009 mass shooting at Fort Hood.\n\"We're heartbroken that something like this might've happened again.\"\n\"But just for now I would hope that everyone across the country keep the families of Fort Hood in our thoughts and our prayers. The folks there have sacrificed so much on behalf of our freedom. Many of the people there have been on multiple tours of Iraq and Afghanistan, they served with valor, they served with distinction. At their home base they need to feel safe. We don't yet know what happened tonight but obviously that sense of safety has been broken once again. We need to find out exactly what happened.,\" he said.\nMr. Obama spoke at a restaurant in Chicago where he held a fundraiser.\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel called the shooting a \u201cterrible tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing more important to us as an institution than the safety and well-being of our people, and for that reason I am grateful to all the first responders who rushed to the scene.

Hood community.\"\nGov. Rick Perry issued a statement Wednesday night in which he said, \u201cToday Fort Hood was once again stricken by tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cAs Texans, our first priority must be caring for the victims and their families.
