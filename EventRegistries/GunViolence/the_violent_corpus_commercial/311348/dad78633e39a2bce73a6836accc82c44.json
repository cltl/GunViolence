Police said at least four individuals fired shots.\nIn February, Lewis was charged with battery against a household member.\nOn March 2, Lewis was charged with tampering with evidence. He was accused of hiding a handgun with the intent to prevent the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of himself. He was also charged with negligent use of a deadly weapon, as well as unlawful carrying of a handgun by a person under 19 years of age.\nLewis was booked into the Bernalillo County Detention Center March 4, court officials said. He was released the next day. According to juvenile court, Lewis had been scheduled to have a hearing on all those charges Tuesday.\nLewis\u2019 mother, Munah Green, doesn\u2019t feel his past matters.\n\"No one has a right to kill my son over a skateboard. I don't give a damn how bad his history was,\u201d said Green. \u201cWe're not talking about his history or any of that. Let's bring this to justice. Let's talk about that.\"\nShe said his history has nothing to do with why her son isn\u2019t here.\n\"Now, I'm not saying he didn't get into some trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cBut was he ever found guilty for anything he got into trouble for? No he hasn't.\"\nGreen said she wants to know when they\u2019re going to bring his killer to justice. She said she wants police to be open with her in the investigation and let her know when they question a suspect.\nPolice said two groups began fighting over a skateboard before his death Sunday. They said there were multiple shooters, and witnesses recall hearing 20 gunshots. Police have not said how many bullets were fired or what type of guns were used.\nSeven people, ranging in age from 17 to 27, were hit. One of them remains in the hospital, and the other five are expected to recover.\nEspinoza said police aren't sharing information on number of shooters, shots fired or type of guns yet because it may be used to corroborate statements from suspects and witnesses.\n\"If I'm a shooter and I know how many times I fired, or I'm a witness and I know how many times the shooter fired, that plays into our investigation,\" said Espinoza.\nNo arrests have been made.\nPolice said the altercation was videotaped by someone on scene. They're asking those with information on or video of the incident to contact police and help detectives solve the case.\nKOAT Action 7 News reporter Laura Thoren contributed to this report."}
