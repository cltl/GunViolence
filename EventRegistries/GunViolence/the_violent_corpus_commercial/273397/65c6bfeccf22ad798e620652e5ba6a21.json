Officers learned that an unknown white male suspect entered the residence and shot four individuals with a shot gun and fled the location. Three of the four victims were killed and one victim was transported to Baylor Hospital.\nOn January 9, 2015, Homicide Detectives received information from the Southeast Deployment Unit about a suspicious person who resides next to the offense location. This individual was observed sitting in his vehicle while parked in the driveway of his residence. Officers contacted the subject and, during the course of the field interview, determined a shotgun was stored within his vehicle.\nHomicide detectives later contacted the subject at his residence and received written consent to take custody of his shotgun. A firearms examiner then tested the shotgun, matching it to physical evidence collected from the crime scene on January 4, 2015.\nWith this information, detectives obtained an arrest warrant for Jack Diwitt Hunt W/M 4/18/1961. Hunt was arrested without incident earlier today by officers from the Southeast Patrol Division. He was been placed into the Lew Sterrett Criminal Justice Center for Capital Murder with a bond of $500,000.\nPost a comment\nName/Nickname:\n(required)\nEmail Address: (must be a valid address)\n(will not be published or shared)\nComments: (plain text only)"}
