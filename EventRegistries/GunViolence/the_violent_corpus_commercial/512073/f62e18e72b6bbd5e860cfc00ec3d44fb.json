The name of the fourth victim, a neighbor, has not been released.\nBELFAIR, Mason County \u2014 Authorities say they used tear gas to flush a suicidal man who had killed several family members from his house \u2014 and that\u2019s when he stepped outside and killed himself.\nThe Mason County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Saturday released a timeline of the standoff, which began after David W. Campbell, 51, called a sheriff\u2019s office supervisor Friday morning to say he had done something bad and was suicidal.\nA small number of deputies initially responded, speaking with Campbell by phone and setting up a perimeter to keep him on the property until a SWAT team could arrive.\nOver 3\u00bd hours, trained negotiators tried to persuade Campbell to surrender, but \u201cit became evident that the suspect was not going to leave the residence voluntarily,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said. Deputies could see him pacing inside, often holding a handgun to his head.\nWhen they deployed tear gas in the house, Campbell came outside with a gun in his hand and yelled at police. He then returned indoors before coming out once more, putting the gun to his temple and firing as the police watched.\nAuthorities said they found four other bodies in a chicken coop on the remote, wooded property on Horseshoe Drive, near Belfair.\nMason County Coroner Wes Stockwell released the identities of three of them Saturday: Campbell\u2019s wife of six years, Lana J. Carlson, 49, and her sons, Quinn and Tory Carlson, who were 16 and 18, respectively.\nStockwell said he was withholding the identity of the fourth victim pending notification of relatives.\nWhen deputies first contacted Campbell, a 12-year-old girl fled from the home, the timeline said. Authorities said she wasn\u2019t shot, but they used a military-surplus armored vehicle to pick her up and bring her safely past the home so she could be evaluated by medical personnel.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is a daughter, or stepdaughter, or what the relationship is,\u201d Chief Deputy Ryan Spurling said. \u201cBut she escaped from the house.\u201d\nJack Pigott, who lives down the road, said it was common for the family to practice shooting. When he heard gunfire about 8:15 p.m. Thursday, that\u2019s what he assumed it was.\n\u201cThe gunshots, I figured, was target practice. I never thought more about it,\u201d Pigott said.\nCarlson\u2019s sons and a daughter were adopted during a previous marriage. Her husband died of cancer, he said.\nCampbell ran a business called Campbell Family Heating and Air Conditioning, according to state records, while Carlson \u2014 who also went by Lana Jane Campbell \u2014 had registered a business called Crispy Edges. She had purchased a food truck, and she and Campbell had been working on the truck but had not been able to secure the county permits needed to operate it, Pigott said.\nHe said Campbell had recently been hospitalized, but he didn\u2019t know why.\nAnother family friendsaid Friday she had seen the family the night before and didn\u2019t see that anything was wrong.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nMute\nCurrent Time 0:00\n/\nDuration Time 0:00\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nStream TypeLIVE\nRemaining Time -0:00\nPlayback Rate\n1\nChapters\nChapters\nsubtitles off, selected\nSubtitles\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\ncaptions off, selected\nCaptions\nFullscreen\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nMason County Sheriff's Office Chief Ryan Spurling speaks Friday afternoon near the property where a man claimed to have shot four people.
