Burke Farrah of the department\u2019s Street Violence Section said the incident at California Avenue and Martin Luther King Boulevard was probably \u201cmotivated by ongoing gang feuds.\n\u201cWe are actively pursuing leads developed during our investigation overnight,\u201d he added.\nFarrah said one of the victims underwent surgery but is expected to recover. The other four were treated and released.\nThe shooting took place in a strip mall outside Zack\u2019s Market. The victims were described as three men, one boy and one girl. The initial description of the shooter was that of a man who may have been driving a white SUV. An officer at the scene said a large group were gathered in the parking lot when gunfire erupted.\nThe intersection was the scene of a murder earlier this year. In February, Toma Threat, 19, was shot to death while walking in the area. At the time, police speculated that the slaying was related to an earlier fight at the Fashion Fair mall."}
