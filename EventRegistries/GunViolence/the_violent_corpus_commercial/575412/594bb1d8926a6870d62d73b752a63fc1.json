(WKRN) \u2014 After a traumatic several days, five year old Caleb Young told News Channel 11\u2019s sister station News 2 that he can\u2019t wait to eat his favorite treat when he gets home from the hospital.\n\u201cDonuts!\u201d exclaimed Young, referring to the treat he will enjoy after he is released from the hospital Monday.\nLast Tuesday, Caleb was out in the yard with his 10-year-old brother shooting birds with a BB gun when he stepped in front of his brother as he fired a shot.\n\u201cComplete fear came over me and I started praying instantly for my son that the Lord would watch over him,\u201d said Kevin Young, Caleb\u2019s father.\nEmergency responders flew Caleb to Vanderbilt Children\u2019s Hospital where he had open heart surgery.\nSurgeons told Caleb\u2019s family they had never seen anything like it. A small BB traveled through the left side of Caleb\u2019s heart, down a vein, and almost reached his liver.\n\u201cThey put a stitch on his heart to close up the wound that was there. Then they x-rayed and they noticed that the BB was down in the lower abdomen,\u201d said Kevin Young.\nCaleb had a second major surgery to remove the BB.\nThe 5-year-old\u2019s recovery will be difficult but doctors said it\u2019s amazing he\u2019s alive today.\n\u201cI am truly thankful because it truly is a miracle that he is still here because I put on my Facebook that I could have easily been standing by a grave, instead of next to a miracle,\u201d said Kevin Young.\nKevin Young said he has been overwhelmed by the thoughtful messages the family has received from across the nation.\nDoctors said Caleb\u2019s recovery will be a long process, but he should be well enough to start kindergarten in the fall.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
