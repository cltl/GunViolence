He was taken to St. Peter Hospital in Olympia, where he underwent surgery and was listed in stable condition.\nDetectives have spoken with the man who survived the shooting and called 911, but they say he's too \"incoherent\" to be of much help. They don't consider him a suspect, but say until they interview him more thoroughly, he won't be ruled out as a suspect.\nAfter receiving search warrants, detectives said they found a half-pound of methamphetamine in the trailer along with six guns and cash from a trailer.\nInvestigators also were seen removing what appeared to be an Army Kevlar vest, a shotgun and a crossbow from a vehicle parked in the property\u2019s backyard.\nAuthorities have not released the identities of the people found dead on the property, but they said the victims were a 31-year-old woman from the Olympia area, a 28-year-old man from the Olympia-area and a 34-year-old from Elma.\nNeighbors said they heard what they thought were fireworks coming from the property Tuesday and again Wednesday morning. Neighbors said people were seen coming and going from the property at all hours.\nThe residents were thought to be drug dealers, said one neighbor.\nInvestigators said it was too early in the investigation to say if the killings were drug-related.\nCopyright 2016 KING"}
