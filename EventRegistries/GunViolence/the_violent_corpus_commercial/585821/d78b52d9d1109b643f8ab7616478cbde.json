He said it is unclear how they knew each other or what their relationship was.\nEach of the three people appears to have been shot once. Both men were likely shot in the head, and the woman was likely shot in the back, Pearsall said. Based on the crime scene\u2019s appearance, the shooting likely happened quickly, without much of a struggle.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the motive or have a suspect at this time,\u201d Pearsall told reporters late Wednesday afternoon. They also have not found the weapon used.\nA 30-year-old man who was taken to Providence St. Peter Hospital with a gunshot wound to the chest likely isn\u2019t a suspect, but he hasn\u2019t been ruled out as a person of interest. Detectives tried to interview him Wednesday afternoon, but he had undergone surgery and was unable to provide much information. He was listed in stable condition Wednesday afternoon.\nThe suspect, or suspects, in the shooting are still at large and likely armed, Pearsall said.\n\u201cIt could be one (person), or it could be several,\u201d Pearsall said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know at this point.\u201d\nThe victims\u2019 bodies were removed from the trailer about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. Coroner Gary Warnock said that autopsies likely would be performed sometime Thursday. Names of the victims will not be released until their families have been notified.\nDeputies found a half pound of methamphetamine, some black tar heroin, several thousand dollars in cash, and six or seven guns inside the camping trailer. Pearsall said that one of the guns is a handgun, and the others are rifles. But it doesn\u2019t appear that any of the guns were used in the shooting. However, the presence of the drugs, cash and guns points to the likelihood that drugs were being sold from the trailer, he said.\nAt least two of the people lived in the trailer, Pearsall said.\nDeputies were first mobilized when a man called 911 about 5:15 a.m. Wednesday and told dispatchers he had been shot, his friends were dead, and he didn\u2019t know where he was, according to Pearsall.\nDeputies used the man\u2019s cellphone signal to track the call to a small, fifth-wheel camping trailer behind a residence in the 500 block of Dutterow Road Southeast.\nThe caller, a 30-year-old Olympia man who was found lying on the ground near Dutterow, was taken to the hospital.\nThere are three other structures on the property besides the trailer: a house, a mobile home and a standalone garage. Pearsall said there were people inside each of the structures at the time of the shooting, but so far no one has been able to provide any information about what happened.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies have searched the entire property, including vehicles, he said.\nSteeley McGrath, who said she is the sister of the woman who died, entered the scene with sheriff\u2019s deputies about 10 a.m.\nJohn Robitsch, who lives across the street from the trailer, said he heard the gunshots.\n\u201cI was sitting on my porch at 5 a.m., and I heard five or six shots,\u201d Robitsch said. \u201cAfter hearing that, I went back in the house.\u201d\nJan Phipps, whose mobile home backs onto Dutterow, said that about 8:45 p.m. Tuesday she had heard a sound that she thought was fireworks. After learning of the shooting, she now thinks it might have been gunshots. She said she didn\u2019t see any vehicles coming or going from the crime scene but did see a man walk toward the road and then walk back onto the property.\nHowever, Pearsall said deputies believe the shooting occurred just before the 911 call.\n\u201cUntil we talk to the guy who\u2019s in the hospital, we believe that it happened at 5 o\u2019clock this morning,\u201d he said.\nThe property has a reputation as a drug house, Phipps said.\n\u201cIt scares me and makes me mad, because that little bit of innocence I have left is gone now,\u201d said Phipps, a 16-year resident of the neighborhood.\n\u201cIt really makes me stop and think about the safety,\u201d she added.\nPearsall said he did not know if the sheriff\u2019s office had a history of responding to calls at the address.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy for the area, and we want to find out who did this,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just hoping some of the stuff we have right now will point us in the right direction.\u201d"}
