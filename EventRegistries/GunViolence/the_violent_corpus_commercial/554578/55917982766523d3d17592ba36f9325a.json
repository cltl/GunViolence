But before it got too bad, it would quiet out.\u201d\nPolice arrested 49-year-old John Ali Hoffman as police responded to a disturbance call at the Moku Street home where Hoffman lives, not far from the subdivision\u2019s community center. He was arrested on suspicion of three counts of second-degree murder, one count of first-degree murder and a firearms offense.\nHoffman is being held at the Hilo police cellblock while detectives investigate.\nPolice Capt. Robert Wagner of the Hilo Criminal Investigation Division said Hoffman was driving away from the house in a car with no lights on when responding officers arrived and police stopped the vehicle. They found the woman\u2019s body in the trunk and a firearm on the front seat of the car, he said.\nInside the house, officers discovered the bodies of a boy and a girl, Wagner said. Police were trying to identify the victims.\n\u201cIt does appear that the lady in the car, the suspect that was arrested, John Hoffman, and the two juveniles were living together in the house,\u201d Wagner said.\nOther media reports cited sources as saying the victims were Hoffman\u2019s wife and two small children.\nMullins said he did hear a disturbance but didn\u2019t hear gunshots.\n\u201cIt was pretty rainy and the coqui were loud but in between the shower bursts it did sound like a woman\u2019s voice was piercing through the night, and then it would go away. And I was trying to sleep so I tried to tune that out and I didn\u2019t think anything of it at that time,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything had actually happened until the police accidentally came to our place first. And then they came back over to ask us did we hear any popping noises or any commotion last night. And we told them we really didn\u2019t hear any because of the rain.\u201d\nMullins said he didn\u2019t know the neighbors and described them as \u201cvery reclusive people.\u201d\n\u201cThe only interactions I had with them was hearing them because my office window is about 15 feet away from their building, and it\u2019s always open,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA lot of times in the mornings, I would hear him outside, ranting and venting. And sometimes, he would have a friend over there, you could hear another male voice. He\u2019d be going on and on about something but I would tune that out because I\u2019m working.\n\u201cYou would definitely get the feeling, living next door to them, that they were not a happy household.\u201d\nMullins said the incident is a rarity in the quiet subdivision just outside Pahoa.\n\u201cLeilani is such a nice little neighborhood and people are very friendly. You see (people) and you wave when you walk down the street and they drive by. And I really like that about here,\u201d he said.\nA triple homicide is rare, not only for the area, but for the entire island, the captain said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember having one before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely unique.\u201d\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\nEmail John Burnett at jburnett@hawaiitribune-herald.com."}
