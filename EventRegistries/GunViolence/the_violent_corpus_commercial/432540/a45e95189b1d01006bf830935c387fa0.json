When they arrived, they discovered two victims with gunshot wounds. Marsha Lynch suffered a gunshot wound to the leg. Sharai Lynch suffered a gunshot wound to the head. Sharai died while en route to the hospital.\nOfficers say Marsha told authorities a semi-automatic weapon fell from a table and discharged once it hit the ground. She further told police that when the gun discharged, it struck her leg first, then traveled into the child's head.\nAn autopsy performed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab indicated the bullet entered Sharai's head first, and then traveled through Marsha's leg. Police say this information led them to believe the story about the gun falling off of a table and accidentally discharging is false.\nDeputies requested the firearm used in the shooting be analyzed as well. The GBI crime lab determined the firearm was functioning properly and that it could not have accidentally discharged.\nMarsha Lynch has been charged with obstruction. Quincy Lynch has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct. Both Marsha and Quincy have bonded out of jail.\nCopyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).
