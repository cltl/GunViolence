Words were exchanged, and at some point, one of the suspects entered a white sedan and grabbed a handgun, according to Metro.\nThe man fired at the victims, striking them, before he and the other man involved in the initial argument got into the car and continued shooting as they drove away, a Metro news release said.\nIt was initially reported that the man had shot a round into the ground as well.\nJudy Nitura, an employee at the Beef Jerky Store on 3rd Street, said she heard a shot this morning but wasn't sure if it was a serious issue.\n\"I thought it was something else,\" she said. \"I didn't see anybody running and nobody shouted, so I didn't think anything of it.\"\nThe suspects are in custody.\nThe two men involved in the initial verbal altercation who are being sought by police are described as black male adults in their 20s. One was wearing a long-sleeved maroon shirt and blue jeans; the other was wearing an orange shirt and shorts.
