Lancaster County Judge David Workman on Thursday ordered that 17-year-old George W. Rosado face counts of misdemeanor Involuntary Manslaughter, Felony Theft of a Firearm, and misdemeanor Drug Paraphernalia in the adult criminal court system.\nWorkman explained in court that Rosado\u2019s history and prior experiences do not indicate Rosado could be rehabilitated in the juvenile court system.\nWorkman said he found testimony credible from a local psychologist, Dr. Jonathan Gransee, who opined at a hearing last month that Rosado is \u201cunlikely to be rehabilitated in juvenile treatment.\u201d\nRosado allegedly shot and killed 15-year-old Ibram Hanna on August 12, 2016 with a gun Rosado stole hours earlier from an unlocked vehicle.\nInvoluntary manslaughter involves a death that results from a reckless or grossly negligent act.\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Judge Workman ordered that Rosado be transferred to Lancaster County Prison and set bail at $100,000. Rosado has been at Lancaster County Youth Intervention Center since August.\nAssistant District Attorney Amber Czerniakowski, who presented testimony at the December 9 hearing, requested bail be set, considering Rosado is facing a prison sentence and is a possible flight risk.\nLancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman, after Thursday\u2019s hearing, stressed that Rosado is presumed innocent.\n\u201cThis is just one part of the process,\u201d Stedman said. \u201cWe stand by our filings in the case requesting certification and the reasons we have asserted in court.\u201d\nHanna died of a single gunshot. The shooting happened at Rosado\u2019s West Main Street home where he lived with a relative."}
