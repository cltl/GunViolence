Austin police say Loera and another teen broke into the house, where investigators believe the pair found the homeowner's gun and loaded it. The other boy, who police say was 16 years old, appears to have accidentally shot Loera, police said.\nThe 16-year-old suspect, who was not identified because he is a minor, turned himself in and was taken to Gardner Betts Juvenile Justice Center. He was charged with manslaughter and burglary, Austin police said."}
