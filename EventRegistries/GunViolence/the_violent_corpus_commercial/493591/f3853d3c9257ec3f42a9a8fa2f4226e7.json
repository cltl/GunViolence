They did so at about 9:15 p.m. and shortly after assisted the man in removing a young girl from the back seat.\nPolice spokesman Garry Flot confirmed the car in the parking lot is the one that brought the injured child to Winn Dixie. He declined to say who the man and girl were in relation to the victim or the man being questioned.\nPolice investigators had not roped off any portion of Huntlee Drive around 10 p.m., but they congregated around a one-story home with the front door open and porch light turned on. A man who answered the door one house over said he isn't very familiar with the young family that moved in next to him a few months back.\nBut the man and woman seem like \"very loving parents,\" said the neighbor, who preferred to be identified only as Bruno.\n\"All I know is they bend over backwards playing with that little boy,\" he said.\nStay with NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune as more information becomes available on this breaking story."}
