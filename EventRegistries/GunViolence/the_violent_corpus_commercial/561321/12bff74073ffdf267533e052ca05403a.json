Records don\u2019t list an attorney to speak for Wayman, whose bond tops $500,000.\nThe shooting happened Tuesday at a travel trailer, where the family lived, near Vasthi. Dominic Tra\u2019Juan Castro died Wednesday at a Wichita Falls hospital.\nAn affidavit says several people were at the home during the shooting. Sheriff Kenny Lemons says Wayman was charged after evidence didn\u2019t match witness statements.\nLemons says it appears Wayman pointed the gun at the boy and told him if he didn\u2019t stop jumping on the bed he would shoot him. He then fired the gun and struck the boy in the back of the head.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
