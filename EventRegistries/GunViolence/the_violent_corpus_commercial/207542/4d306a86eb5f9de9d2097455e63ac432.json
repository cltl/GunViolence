The truck was traveling down Hudson Chapel Road near Browns Chapel Road near midnight. Deputies said a high-caliber hunting rifle went off, killing Austin.\nInvestigators are still looking into how it happened but believe it was accidental.\nChannel 9 spoke with Austin\u2019s family, who said the sophomore loved life, and they want to celebrate that life.\n\"We're taking it minute by minute, day by day,\" said John Hedrick, Austin's uncle. \"It's really hard to process.\"\nAustin played football and wrestled and was very involved in his church, his family said.\n\"He sang at church, he loved to sing and dance,\" said Linda Hedrick, Austin's grandmother. \"He loved to praise the Lord and I know that's where he's at now.\"\nThe latest incident to rock the Catawba County community comes just two weeks after Bunker Hill students Alec Sigmon and Justin Turner were killed in a car crash. Two other students and a recent graduate were also injured in that crash on River Bend Road on Oct. 3.\nThe school is cancelling this week's \u201cSpirit Week\u201d activities leading to Friday\u2019s Homecoming following Austin\u2019s death, and grief counselors will be on hand to help students cope with the tragedy.\nSchool officials said they chose to cancel the activities to create a respectful atmosphere for those who are grieving.\nThe game and other Homecoming activities will still take place Friday night.\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><p>Family says he played football, loved wrestling and was very involved in his church. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wsoctv\">@wsoctv</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/KnZULfQHfW\">pic.twitter.com/KnZULfQHfW</a></p>&mdash; Blake Hanson (@BlakeWSOC9) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlakeWSOC9/status/523599176228429824\"></a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>"}
