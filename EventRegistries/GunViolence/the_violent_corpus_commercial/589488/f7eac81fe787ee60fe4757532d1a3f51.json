The suspect was detained east of Portland just hours later.\nEarlier reports stated the berry farm was combined with a marijuana farm, but Marion County Sheriff's deputies say the marijuana grows are actually on a separate private property, are legal, and are not associated with the shooting.\nSheriff's deputies identified the suspect as 29-year-old Bonifacio Oseguera-Gonzalez. He was booked into the Marion County Jail on charges of aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder.\nDeputies responded to a farmhouse in the 13000 block of Kiliam Road NE near Woodburn around 11:20 a.m. Monday.\nThey found the bodies of two people at the home, along with two other people who had life-threatening gunshot wounds. One of the gunshot victims has died from her injuries, while a man remains hospitalized in critical condition.\n\"One male was found deceased outside... the crime scene is very large,\" Marion County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Chris Baldridge said.\nAfter finding the bodies, police were able to get a suspect description and information on the car he was driving.\n\"A suspect was able to be identified initially through our contacts on scene, we were able to get that out to local agencies and OSP was able to find him on I-84 East,\" Baldridge said. \"I want to make sure that the public knows that we do have our suspect in custody and there is no immediate danger to the public whatsoever.\"\nOfficials don't think the shootings were related to the marijuana grow, which was legal.\nIdentities of the dead and wounded were not immediately released, and police said they do not know if the shooter was related to or knew the victims.\n\"We are very early in the investigation and very few details are available for release at this time,\" the Marion County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.\nOseguera-Gonzalez is expected to be arraigned Tuesday afternoon."}
