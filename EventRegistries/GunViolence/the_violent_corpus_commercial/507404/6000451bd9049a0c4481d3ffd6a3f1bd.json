Don Coppola. The teenager was booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Juvenile Detention Center.\nThe slain 16-year-old, Darneisha Williams, was being kept on a ventilator at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center for at least a day before police reported Saturday she had died.\nWilliams and her uncle were playing with a gun in the kitchen of a residence at 3811 Brady St. when Williams was shot in the head, Baton Rouge Police said in a news release last week. The two were \u201cbest friends\u201d and the boy was put on suicide watch following the incident, William\u2019s mother Darlene Williams previously told The Advocate.\nThe killing was one of at least five accidental shootings in the past three months in Baton Rouge that have left four young people dead."}
