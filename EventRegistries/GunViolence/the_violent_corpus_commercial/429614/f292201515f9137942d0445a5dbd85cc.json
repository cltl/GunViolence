Lacy\nPEORIA - A fourth Peoria man was ordered held on $2 million bond for last weekend's fatal shooting of a Peoria teen.\nKainen I. Lacy, 21, of 2705 N. Springdale Ave., appeared in Peoria County Circuit Court on one count of first-degree murder. Like the three men before him, he's accused of participating in the botched robbery attempt that left 14-year-old Tommie T. Forest III dead.\nAll four men, including Alex F. Collins, 21, Samuel T. Clay Jr. and Dontarius N. Berdin, both 20, have been charged under the felony murder provision that holds if a person commits a felony, such as home invasion or robbery, and a person dies, then that's murder. The bonds of Collins, Clay and Berdin also are $2 million and all four are scheduled for a Nov. 12 preliminary hearing.\nNone of the men charged have been alleged to be the actual shooter who killed Forest or who shot three other teens who were at the home, 2405 N. Flora Ave., early on the morning of Oct. 10. Assistant State's Attorney Steve Pattelli said someone went to the front door, asked if a person was there, was told he wasn't and then left. Another person returned and that's when a group of people, possibly as many as seven, barged into the house and the shooting started.\nA fifth man, Demerious D. Clark, 18, also was arrested but he is being held on $125,000 bond in an unrelated case. Police still are looking for two others.\nIf convicted, Lacy, Collins, Clay and Berdin all face at least 35 years and possibly up to life in prison.\nAndy Kravetz can be reached at 686-3283 or akravetz@pjstar.com.
