He was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital where he later died.\nDuring the investigation, officers arrested Leonard Temple, 19, a friend of the victim. He's charged with reckless homicide, child endangering and tampering with evidence.\nThough, police charged Temple with reckless homicide, they know he didn\u2019t plan it and don\u2019t believe he wanted to do it. But what he was doing at the time when the gun went off was wrong.\n\u201cMore of an unfortunate set of circumstances than anything else,\u201d Lt. Joe Heffernan said. \u201cYet again, we have another young life lost because of an unsecured gun in the home and falls in the wrong hands and is mishandled, and now, we have a 14-year-old dead.\u201d\nPolice are still working to determine who was the owner of the gun and why it was unsecure and left within reach of Temple.\nAlexander was an eighth grader at East Broadway Elementary School. A TPS spokesperson says grief counselors are on hand at the school for students and staff.\nTemple is currently being held in jail on a $500,000 bond. He will be back in court on Jan. 17.\nRegardless of the answers police are looking for, Alexander is the third, young life lost in Toledo within a month, after a gun has been left out in a home. It is the second homicide of the year for the city of Toledo.\nThe police department recently purchased gun locks and are working to have an event to get them out to those who need them. If you can\u2019t wait, they are available at the Safety Building downtown."}
