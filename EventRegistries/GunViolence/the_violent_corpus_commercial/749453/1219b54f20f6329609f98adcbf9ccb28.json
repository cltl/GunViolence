Toledo", "dct": "Sat, 14 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT", "id": "1219b54f20f6329609f98adcbf9ccb28", "content": "A Toledo boy slain Thursday is the third juvenile police say was accidentally killed with an unsecured gun in about three months.\nPolice said Dominique Alexander, 14, was shot about 7:10 p.m. at a house in the 1500 block of East Broadway. Officials identified his friend, Leonard Temple, 19, as the unintentional shooter.\nMr. Temple, who resides at the home, was arraigned Friday in Toledo Municipal Court on multiple felony counts. Judge C. Allen McConnell set bond at $500,000 with no 10 percent option allowed.\nDominique was pronounced dead at Mercy Health St. Vincent Medical Center. Authorities charged Mr. Temple with reckless homicide, child endangering, and tampering with evidence.\nLt. Joe Heffernan, department spokesman, said Mr. Temple appeared to mishandle the firearm and strike his friend in the chest. He called the shooting an entirely avoidable act.\n\u201cThese are hard cases to handle because there's no reason something like this should have happened,\u201d Lt. Heffernan said.\nInvestigators are still determining how Mr. Temple obtained the firearm, he said.\nTo further prevent these unintentional shootings, the department continues to provide gun locks for the public. Police have about 500 available, Lt. Heffernan said.\nRelatives of Mr. Temple described the shooting as an accident, but declined interview requests after Friday's arraignment. There was no answer at Mr. Temple's residence. A listed East Toledo address for the Alexander youth was out of date.\nDominique was an eighth-grade student at East Broadway Elementary School, and counselors were available at the school. Parents will receive a letter informing them as well, Toledo Public Schools spokesman Patty Mazur said.\nJourni Johnson, 2, was shot and killed in December and Ty-Ryne Hoskins, 3, was killed in late October in what authorities described as preventable shootings with unsecured firearms.\nJourni died of a single gunshot wound to the head. Her father, Turhan Johnson, 27, is charged with child endangering after he admitted to police he left his 38-caliber handgun unsecured in his home in the 2400 block of Seaman Road, according to court documents.\nTy-Ryne died after bullet went through a wall and struck him in the torso. Prosecutors filed first-degree misdemeanor charges Thursday against the gun owner, a 15-year-old relative.\nMr. Temple remained incarcerated Friday in the Lucas County jail. Dominique's killing is the second homicide this year in the city.\nContact Ryan Dunn at: rdunn@theblade.com, 419-724-6095, or on Twitter @rdunnblade."}
