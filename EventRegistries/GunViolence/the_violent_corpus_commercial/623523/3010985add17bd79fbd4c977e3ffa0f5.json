It was quiet, he said, until a truck pulled up to the neighboring home.\n\u201cAbout five guys and a girl got out and went to the neighbor's house. We heard a lot of banging and they pulled him out of the house and started beating him up,\u201d he said.\nHeredia said they stepped in to help. He said his brother, Rojelio, fired two rounds into the air to scare off the group.\n\u201cWhen they were leaving they shot back at us and hit my friend. My cousin was shot. My neighbor was shot,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI heard the car speed off and hit these bumps over here,\u201d said Carlos, who lives a block from where the first shooting happened.\nHe said people in a car fleeing the scene fired more shots.\n\u201cAfter that you can tell he still shot off a couple rounds. They found the shells right there,\u201d Carlos said.\n\u201cIt seemed to be nothing but a vengeance shooting,\u201d said Don Davidson, another neighbor and friend of the Heredia\u2019s.\nRojelio Heredia, 24, is in custody facing a charge of first-degree murder with extreme indifference. From the other group, Brandon Karr, 24, is also facing the same charge.\nNeighbors said whatever happened, it should have never escalated to the violent point that it did.\n\u201cEveryone wants their guns and everyone wants their safety, but no one really uses their guns responsibly anymore.\"\nAdams County detectives said they are confident all suspects are in custody and there is no danger to the community."}
