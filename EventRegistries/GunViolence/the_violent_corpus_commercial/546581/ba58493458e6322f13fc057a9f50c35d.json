Hollywood Blvd., just a block away from Harney Middle School.\nMore than 50 rounds were fired in a gunfight and stabbing early Saturday morning that left one dead, four injured and a juvenile arrested, facing a charge of murder, Las Vegas police said.\nThe shootings and stabbing occurred after a fight broke out, Metro said. It is unclear what led up to the fight\u2014 or what escalated it to gunfire and stabbing.\nAngelo\u2019s older brother, Valentino Cruz, woke up Saturday morning to hear that his younger brother was killed. One of six children, he called Angelo a \u201cquiet kid\u201d who rarely went out. \u201cHe just liked playing video games.\u201d\nAt 3:28 a.m., police responded to a call reporting someone shot in the 5700 block of Pavot Court, near East Vegas Valley Drive, police said. Just one minute later, officers were also dispatched to the 8500 block of Pacific Shores Drive, a few blocks away from the other call, to a report of several people shot inside of a pickup truck, a Metro said.\nResponding officers and medical personnel found a male \u2014 identified by police only as Hispanic \u2014 in a home on Pavot Court \u201csuffering from what was later determined to be multiple stab wound to his upper body,\u201d Metro said.\nHe was taken to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center \u201cin stable condition,\u201d police said. The extent of his injuries was not specified. Two other men were at the house with him, police said.\nAt the same time on Pacific Shores Drive, police and medical personnel found four \u201cHispanic male juveniles with apparent gunshot injuries,\u201d Metro said.\nOne of the four was pronounced dead on the scene; the other three were taken to University Medical Center. Two of the juveniles had nonlife-threatening injuries, and one of them is in critical condition.\n\u201cTwo other subjects were located at the scene with the victims,\u201d Metro said.\nMetro\u2019s homicide section is investigating the case. \u201cAll of the subjects were at the Hollywood Recreation Center when a fight broke out,\u201d police said.\nDuring this fight, one person was stabbed in the neck, and at least 50 rounds are believed to have been fired during the exchange of gunfire, police said.\nCasings from several different calibers were recovered from the scene, indicating that multiple firearms were involved in the shooting, Metro Capt. Jack Owen said Saturday night.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done so far has not worked,\u201d Owen said during a gathering at the park outside the Hollywood Recreation Center while vigil-goers held candles and pastors comforted the grieving family members.\nPolice need the help of the community to address these types of violent crimes, Owen said. He underscored the need to prevent these types of events from happening and the importance of preventing access to guns by children. \u201cThis has got to stop.\u201d\n\u201cWe are in crisis,\u201d Metro Deputy Chief Jim Owens said, echoing the sentiment.\nWhen asked if the area was patrolled by park police, or possibly school police given the vicinity to the middle school, Owen said that Metro patrolled the area.\nPolice did not specify how many separate shooters were involved, or how the other men found at the two locations with the injured were related to the fight at the recreation center.\nCrystal Barboza said that she didn\u2019t know who Angelo was with at the time he was killed.\nPolice said one of the juveniles they found at Pavot Court was responsible for the shooting of Barboza. He was taken into custody and booked into the Clark County Juvenile Detention Center on a charge of murder with a deadly weapon, according to Metro.\nThis is the 55th homicide investigated by the department in 2016.\nReview-Journal reporter Jessica Terrones contributed to this report.
