Where\u2019s my husband?\u2019 and I asked her to describe him and she described him and I looked right over there and saw a white-haired guy in a blue shirt that he had on ... and he was not moving, not breathing,\u201d Lea said.\nThe fourth victim, Olga Woltering, 84, was preparing for a cruise with husband Ralph to celebrate his 90th birthday, according to members of the Transfiguration Catholic Church.\nThe couple joined the church in 1978 and sat regularly sat in the front pews for the weekly 5 p.m. Mass, according to their pastor.\n\u201cOlga was one of the most joyful, loving, caring and committed people I have ever met,\u201d said the Rev. Fernando Molina-Restrepo. \u201cThis is a horrible tragedy for everyone here at Transfiguration, especially because Olga was so loved.\u201d\nWoltering\u2019s family put out a statement Saturday morning asking for privacy in their time of grief, calling Olga \u201cthe cornerstone of our family.\u201d\n\u201cWhile she\u2019s absent in our lives now, she remains in our hearts, thoughts, and memories for ever,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHer bright smile and loving manner will be missed by all who had the fortune to know her.\u201d\nSeveral parishioners took to social media to mourn Woltering\u2019s death.\n\u201cTragedy hit too close to home today.
