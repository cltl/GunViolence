He declared his firearm to the airline, and had a military ID.\nOnce in the baggage area, he retrieved his bag, and loaded his semi-automatic handgun in the bathroom before he shot at least 13 people, killing five and sending eight to the hospital. Between 30 and 40 more were injured after the shooting, officials said.\nBroward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Santiago was caught by a Broward Sheriff\u2019s deputy and taken into custody without incident.\nThe FBI and Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office had a \u201clong\u201d interview with Santiago.

They did not rule out terrorism. Investigators said Santiago used a semi-automatic handgun in the shooting.\nAccording to CNN, Santiago went to the FBI in Anchorage a few months ago, claiming that he was hearing voices telling him to join the terrorist organization ISIS. While Santiago said he didn\u2019t intend to harm anyone, his erratic behavior concerned FBI agents and they contacted local police. He also was taken for a mental health evaluation, an FBI official said at a press conference late Friday evening.\nMeanwhile, officials are working to open the airport by 5 a.m. Saturday.\nTraffic at the airport has grown relentlessly in the past decade. In the first half of 2016, 7.4 million passengers got on a plane at Fort Lauderdale. That\u2019s up two-thirds from the traffic in early 2003.\nInternational flights drove almost half of the increase in the airport\u2019s traffic. International flights increased about five fold: In last March alone, about 272,000 people left Fort Lauderdale for an international destination.\nThe airport also hosts flights coming in for cruises."}
