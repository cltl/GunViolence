It struck Travon Rollins in the chest, killing him.\nNow his cousin, 15-year-old Cartrez Harvey, is being charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm by a delinquent.\nWhen police arrived at the Chesapeake Place apartments, blood was on the stoop of the home and in the street. Rollins, a 16-year-old upcoming junior at Rickards High School, had fallen several times on his way out of the home where he lived with his mother.\nA crowd had gathered. A short distance away, people wailed as the news of Rollins\u2019 death spread.\nBefore first responders arrived, several teens loaded Rollins into a car and headed for the hospital, neighbors said the day after the shooting.\nStephen Hardy, a neighbor whose son played basketball in the neighborhood with Rollins, helped load the teen into a car. The driver tried to rush Rollins to the hospital but was told by 911 dispatchers to turn around and return to the scene. First responders rushing Rollins to the hospital did not feel he would survive.\nHardy described the moments after the shooting as a panic.\n\u201cThat was everybody\u2019s main concern that the boy get off to the hospital,\u201d Hardy said the day after the shooting. \u201cThey were kids. They didn\u2019t know what to do. They panicked. They were like what do we do, what do we do?\u201d\nAt first, Harvey told investigators he and several other teens were playing with three guns, a handgun, carbine and a rifle, in Rollins\u2019 upstairs bedroom.\nHe said Rollins was pointing the gun at him and they tussled over it when the gun went off.\nBut his story changed several times during a police interview.\nPolice left Harvey in the interview room with his mother who continued to press him about what happened. Court records say Harvey told her he had been in possession of the gun, not Rollins, when it went off. He vacillated about what to tell investigators. At one point, he asked his grandmother whether he should keep lying.\nShe told him to tell the truth.\nPolice did not find the handgun that shot Rollins at the home. Instead, they found it in the wood line on Dian Court, a dead end road a half-mile away.\nHarvey eventually told police he and another man had driven to Dian Court to throw the gun into the woods where Tallahassee Police found it. Harvey told police the weapons were stolen.\nWhen pressed about discrepancies in his story, he told investigators he had his own gun at the home. He thought it was empty, but it went off when someone bumped into him. He said he didn't pull the trigger.\nHis story had changed, he said, because others were telling him what to say and he followed their advice.\nAt the time of the shooting, Harvey, who is being charged as an adult, was on probation for charges of fleeing or eluding police and resisting arrest.\nHe is being held at the Leon County Jail on $25,000 bond.\nContact Karl Etters at ketters@tallahassee.com or @KarlEtters on Twitter."}
