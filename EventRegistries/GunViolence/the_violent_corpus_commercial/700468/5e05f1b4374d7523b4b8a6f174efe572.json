However, sources said a firearm was found in his possession.\nDiana Gomez, 27, and her two children who were shot in an attempted robbery Monday night. Four-year-old Ava Castillo died after being rushed to the hospital. Her 10-year old sister, Betzida Castillo, is in stable condition at the hospital. Gomez remains in critical condition. Her husband said she still can't speak but she is expected to survive.\nHarris County Sheriff's Deputies responded to the shooting call just before 9 p.m. at the Mission Falls apartments in the 10400 block of Greens Crossing Boulevard.\nBeverly Collins lives in a first-floor apartment feet away from where the shooting happened.\n\u201cI thought I heard BB guns, because all I heard were three shots going off,\u201d said Collins. \"And I saw a woman and a little girl laying on the ground by the car, by the tire.\u201d\nAuthorities said Gomez and her two children were unloading groceries when two men pulled up in a dark-colored sedan and parked near Gomez and her vehicle.\nOne of the men was able to grab the strap of Gomez's purse but she fought back. One of the suspects pulled a handgun and shot the family multiple times. Neighbors counted nine shots.\n\"I think it's heartbreaking that a family has to get robbed, a mother gets robbed and a baby died,\" said David Mendoza, a witness.\n\u201cFor a purse? For money,\u201d questioned neighbor Sharon Williams. \u201cWhen did we get to this point? [For] some senseless inhumane person to take from someone who\u2019s struggling and trying to make ends meet, it just has to stop!\u201d\nWilliams laid a pair of stuffed animals, some flowers and a bundle of balloons outside of the apartment building where crime scene tape and blood splatter remain. \u201cThe red balloons represent the mom and the daughter that\u2019s still hanging on to life,\u201d explained Williams. \u201cThe pink balloon represents the four-year-old who didn\u2019t even get a chance.\u201d\n\"We have investigators here, deputies combing through, hopefully we\u2019ll be able to catch a break and catch these guys,\" said Deputy Thomas Gilliland.\nInvestigators are looking at nearby surveillance video for further clues. They are also looking into whether this case could be connected to other violent robberies in the area.\nA detailed description of the suspects has not been released.\nCall Houston Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS if you have any information.\n(\u00a9 2017 KHOU)"}
