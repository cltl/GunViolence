Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said this year authorities have seen a rise in \"cluster\" shootings in which multiple victims are struck by gunfire, and they are investigating whether there is a cause for the rise in cluster shootings.\nOverall, shootings in Baltimore are up this year over last by double-digit figures, though Batts said the number of shooting incidents is about the same as it was last year. He called Saturday's shooting \"outrageous.\"\nThe shooting happened around 9:15 p.m. in the 1500 block of W. Fayette St., police said. The other six victims, all adults, and were expected to survive their injures, with a couple of them running to flag down police a couple of blocks away and others taking themselves to a hospital."}
