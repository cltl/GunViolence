Humphries was on the street after being accused of another murder in July, and posting 10 percent of his $500,000 bail.\nLittle more than three months earlier he was brought before another Cook County judge on murder charges after prosecutors said he and a second man flashed gang signs before fatally shooting Shavonte Howard.\nHoward, of the 5300 block of South Hoyne Avenue, was shot in the head about noon on July 4 in the 5600 block of South Western Avenue, police said.\nChamp, the \"main player\" in the Cornell Square Park shooting, had been convicted of gun possession as a felon last year, Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy said at a news conference.\nA judge sent Champ to boot camp, and he was released when he completed the program.\n\u201cIf Bryon Champ is not on the street \u2014 as he shouldn\u2019t have been \u2014 this incident likely does not occur,\" said McCarthy, who has advocated stricter sentencing for gun crimes. \u201cHe received boot camp for that gun crime and was back out on the streets to be a part of this senseless shooting.\"\nA few days after the initial arrests, a fifth man, David Logan, 22, was arrested in connection with the incident.\nEarlier this month, Darren Curtis, 28, was charged in the incident as well."}
