Carmello leaves behind a loving mother and younger brother Karleon. As you can imagine Zazasha is grieving right now and the last thing she should be burdened with is the financial cost associated with burying her first child. Any assistance that you could provide in aiding this family in this most urgent time of need would be greatly appreciated."}
