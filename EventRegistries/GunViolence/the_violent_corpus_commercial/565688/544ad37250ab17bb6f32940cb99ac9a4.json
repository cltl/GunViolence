Kpana-Quamoh, 18, of Milton Drive, died Sunday evening in what appears to be an accidental shooting at a North Nashville residence, police spokeswoman Kris Mumford said Thursday.\nOfficers were dispatched to a home in the 2700 block of Hydes Ferry Road at 10:45 p.m. for a report of a shooting and found Kpana-Quamoh lying on the floor of a bedroom suffering from a gunshot wound.\nA preliminary investigation revealed the teen, who had the gun with him in his possession, was at his friend's home, thought the gun was unloaded and at some point the gun fired, striking him, Mumford said.\nThe teen was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.\nAlthough the shooting appears to be accidental, Mumford said, the case remains open pending the results of an autopsy by the Davidson County Medical Examiner.\nKpana-Quamoh is survived by his parents, Samuel and Terric Kpana-Quamoh (Ramey).\nA four-time Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association state meet qualifier for East Nashville, Kpana-Quamoh clocked the state\u2019s second-fastest Class A-AA qualifying time with a 39.68 at last week\u2019s Middle Sectional, while also helping lead the Eagles\u2019 400-meter relay team to a sectional title (42.61).\n\u201cJust like (Kpana-Quamoh\u2019s) father said last night, when he waked into a room or field or track he lit the place up because he had one of those magical smiles,\u201d East Nashville boys track coach Louis Hines said of Kpana-Quamoh, who had received an academic scholarship to attend Alabama State University. \u201cHe took care of business in the classroom as well, and his good habits there followed him right onto the track.\u201d\nFamily and friends have created a Go Fund Me site to help pay for the cost of his funeral.
