(WKRN) \u2013 Metro police are investigating the accidental shooting death of an 18-year-old.\nDeAndre Kpana-Quamoh had just graduated from East Literature Magnet High School two weeks ago and was ready to compete in the state track championships this weekend.\nHe also a had a full academic scholarship to Alabama State University.\n\u201cHe was a special young man,\u201d said DeAndre\u2019s dad, Sam Kpana-Quamoh. \u201cI love that young man; he\u2019s gone too soon.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t just DeAndre\u2019s parents that had great things to say about him. In addition to being captain of the track tream and maintaining good grades in school, DeAndre also worked weekends at Inglewood Kroger on Gallatin Pike.\n\u201cHe was very smart and very talented,\u201d said DeAndre\u2019s boss at Kroger, Clarissa Whitfield. \u201cHe could sing, he could run. He was amazing.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Whitfield said she was surprised when she heard after his shift Sunday night, he went to a friend\u2019s house where there was a gun.\nThe teens thought it was unloaded, but it went off. DeAndre was shot and died that night.\nAccording to the Safe Tennessee Project, DeAndre is the eighth person to be accidentally shot and killed in Tennessee so far this year.\nWhat\u2019s more, accidental shootings in 2016 are way up from last year. Their data shows at this time last year, 9 adults were unintentionally shot and there were no injuries.\nSo far this year, 21 adults have been accidentally shot. DeAndre is the fifth adult to have died.\nDeAndre\u2019s parents hope other young people learn from their son\u2019s story.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s keeping me going is hearing other people describe him,\u201d said DeAndre\u2019s mom, Terrice Ramey. \u201cHe lit up a room when he went in, the energy and spirit he exuded to other people. This was the child that I had; that was loved by so many.\u201d\n\u201cOur young people are being taken away way too soon by accident or intentional,\u201d said father Kpana-Quamoh. \u201cI always taught my son and I encourage young people to do that same: stand up for what\u2019s right.\u201d\nDeAndre was often at the Margaret Maddox Family YMCA in East Nashville. They have a teen center that provides a safe place for teens to go after school.\n\u201cI have nothing but nice things to say about my interactions with him,\u201d said the former Teen Center director Moses Olomo. \u201cThe Teen Center is great for kids around DeAndre\u2019s age because it\u2019s good to give teens opportunities and options to do different things and it keeps them out of trouble.\u201d\nInstructors there are helping spread the word about a GoFundMe page for DeAndre.
