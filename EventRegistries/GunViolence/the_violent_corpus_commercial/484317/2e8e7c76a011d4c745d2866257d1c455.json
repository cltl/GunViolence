They were found in the basement of a Kimlyn Circle townhouse leased by a victim\u2019s sister.\nRelatives were told that shell casings were found on two levels of the apartment.\nThe victims\u2019 identities were not released Thursday night.\nBut families and friends among the growing crowd of onlookers already knew the truth. Many had heard the names through witnesses who found the four bodies inside the AMHA-owned townhouse near Independence Avenue and Chapel Hill Mall.\nAt one point, police escorted the mothers of at least two victims across the yellow crime-scene tape. The women did not view the carnage, but were given enough information to know the identities of their adult children.\nAfterward, the women and their families walked back to the parking lot in tears, some wailing loudly in agony as they collapsed in the arms of loved ones waiting with the throng.\nThe bodies of the four victims were taken to the Summit County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office where autopsies were to be performed and positive IDs established. No suspects had been identified and no motive had been formed, police said.\nApril Roberts-Gilbert, 45, came to the complex about 4 p.m. with her former husband. She was met by her father, Clifford Walters, and her son, Donald Roberts.\nRoberts-Gilbert said her son, Ronald Roberts, 24, of Akron, was one of the victims.\n\u201cMy son would not do anything for anything like this to happen,\u201d she said, sobbing. \u201cI just feel that it is wrong that they\u2019re out there killing each other. And for what? What does it solve? It\u2019s not solving anything.\n\u201cNow, I have a 24-year-old son that I have to put away. And for what? Can you please tell my why? That\u2019s all I want to know. Why?\u201d\nJasmeen Wadud, 30, was friends with Ronald Roberts and his sister, Diamond Roberts, who lived in the townhouse where the shootings took place. Diamond Roberts was not home during the shootings, her family said.\nLast seen in morning\nRonald Roberts was staying at his sister\u2019s home and was seen taking out the trash about 7 a.m. Friends said one of the female victims was dating Roberts. Wadud said she left her home about 10 a.m. and returned after learning of the shooting.\n\u201cI saw Ronald in the morning like normal,\u201d Wadud said. \u201cAnd the next thing you know, I get a call about this.\u201d\nDonald Durham, 54, the father of Ronald Roberts, said his son recently became a father for the second time and was training to be a draftsman. He said his son was a \u201cgood kid.\u201d\n\u201cI just think he might have got caught up with the wrong crowd,\u201d Durham said. \u201cWhoever did this wasn\u2019t looking for him. But they weren\u2019t going to leave any witnesses.\u201d\nNearby, Donald Roberts was being greeted by family and friends, offering condolences for his slain younger brother.\n\u201cMy brother was a good kid, he didn\u2019t deserve to be killed like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do my little brother like that.\u201d\nA contingent of Akron police officers, from patrolmen to detectives to Police Chief James Nice, were at the scene. Officers were canvassing the circular complex, talking to residents to determine if anyone heard or saw something related to the shooting.\nDetective work\nPolice Lt. Rick Edwards said he expected officers to be at the scene well into the night as the department tried to unravel the slayings, considered one of the largest mass shootings in recent city history.\nTony O\u2019Leary, executive director of Akron Metropolitan Housing Authority, expressed surprise at the discovery of four bodies inside a unit the agency owns.\n\u201cHistorically, it has been a very calm development,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe track all police reports for all of our developments. There\u2019s generally a low level of activity there that would require a police response.\u201d\nA private developer initially built the town home complex, O\u2019Leary said. AMHA acquired it several decades ago.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Akron police at 330-375-2490.
