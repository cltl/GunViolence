A 60-year-old man, a 19-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl were also slain, according to police.\nThe 9-year-old girl was grazed in the chest and has been released from the hospital, Williams said.\nPolice have no suspects and haven't determined a motive.\n\"There's somebody out there who knows a lot more than we know and we need that information,\" Williams said. \"We don't want to speculate on why this happened.\"\nThe medical examiner will identify the three victims who were not named in the press briefing.\nPolice originally did not count Johnson's unborn child among the victims. The child was eventually delivered at University Hospitals Case Medical Center and pronounced dead.\nThis is a developing story."}
