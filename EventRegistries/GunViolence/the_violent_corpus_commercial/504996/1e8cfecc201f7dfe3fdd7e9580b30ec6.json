John Fortunato, spokesman for the sheriff's office.\nInvestigators, who determined there were up to 25 teenagers at the party, discovered approximately 18 shell casings on the opposite side of Lapalco Boulevard near Bonnie Ann Drive. That leads them to believe there was more than one shooter, Fortunato said.\n\"It appears the shooters exited a vehicle and while standing in the street fired multiple times into the building,\" he said. \"We have yet to determine a motive, nor have we identified any suspects in this incident.\"\nAnyone with information is asked to call the JPSO Investigations Bureau at 504-364-5300 or Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111."}
