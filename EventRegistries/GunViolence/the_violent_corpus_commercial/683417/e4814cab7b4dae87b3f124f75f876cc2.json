But just honestly it was just shocking for me to hear that, to see it. I don't know how to comprehend it honestly.\"\n\"Domestic issues are a big problem,\u201d says Lt. Mark Little of the Southaven Police Department. \u201cYou never know when something like this is gonna happen.

The family had moved in with a couple in Southaven two or three months ago.\n\u201cI walk every day. Until it got so hot this summer. And I walk with the black lady some and I know her and she's real nice. And her husband works for Comcast and I've met him once,\u201d says Bill Greenslade.\nThe teenage victim was an 8th grader at Southaven Middle School, where additional counselors were called in to assist and comfort staff and students. A spokesperson for DeSoto County Schools released a statement which expressed sympathy for the family and that the teen was a good student and well-liked.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
