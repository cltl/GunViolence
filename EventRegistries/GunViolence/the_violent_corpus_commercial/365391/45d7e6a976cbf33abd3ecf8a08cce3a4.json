Details were scarce.\nThe conditions of the five gunshot victims weren't immediately known. Detroit Police spokeswoman Cassandra Lewis said early this morning that she had no additional information.\nThe five male victims -- ages 14, 18, 29, and two 19-years-old -- all received gunshot wounds and were listed in temporary serious condition at a local hospital.\nPolice closed off Gratiot between Houston Whittier and Jane while they investigated the scene early into the morning.\nDetroit Police Capt. Rodney Cox of the city's 9th Precinct said there appeared to have been a large gathering at a party store, where people were celebrating the release of a new album by an unspecified performer. Cox said 2-3 gunmen fired shots from across the street at the crowd, injuring five people, including the 14-year-old boy shot in the leg.\nCox said there were no indications that any of the injuries were life threatening. But the situation appeared to be volatile; even as he was interviewed early this morning, there were shots fired nearby east of Gratiot, and more ambulances arriving. It wasn't immediately clear if those shootings were related to the earlier ones.\nSgt. George O'Gorman says no one is in custody and an investigation is ongoing.\nThe incident follows a shooting last week that left a 19-year-old gunman dead and 11 other people wounded at a block party.\nAssociated Press contributed to this story."}
