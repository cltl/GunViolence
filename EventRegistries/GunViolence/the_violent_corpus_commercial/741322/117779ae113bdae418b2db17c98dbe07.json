On New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 only a half hour before midnight \u2014 he showed the gun to a teenaged friend, police said. They were in the bedroom of the man\u2019s home.\nBefore handing the gun to his friend, police said, Roland Von Whitaker, 20, removed the magazine. Likely believing the gun was not loaded, Rahsaan Smith, 18, took the gun and pulled the trigger.\nThe result was tragic.\nThere was a single bullet in the chamber. The bullet struck Von Whitaker, who was killed.\nThen Smith, police said, made a bad situation even worse: He told police that the shooting happened at another location and that another man wearing dark clothing was the shooter.\nHe later admitted, police said, to lying about that and pointed officers to the gun under his mattress. Eventually, police said, Smith admitted to the shooting in the bedroom of his home at 20549 SW 93rd Ave.\nAt 2:30 that Sunday morning, Smith was arrested and charged with killing Von Whitaker with a deadly weapon. Smith is being held at the Turner Guilford Knight correctional center.\nHis bond is set at $100,000."}
