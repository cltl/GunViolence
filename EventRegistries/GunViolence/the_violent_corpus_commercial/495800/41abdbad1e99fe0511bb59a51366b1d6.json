He was rushed into surgery at UF Health Jacksonville where he was pronounced dead the next day.\nThe vehicle and gun used in the toddler's slaying have been recovered, according to the Sheriff's Office. At least one shooter remains at large, said Williams, who expects to make additional arrests in the near future.\nSheriff Williams said Thursday McClendon was not the intended target of the shooting, which was the product of an ongoing gang feud stemming from online rap videos.\nInstead, the sheriff said, the shooters were targeting the toddler's cousin, 19-year-old Reginald Williams, who's affiliated with one gang, which has an estimated 65 members, many of which are incarcerated. Authorities say the shooters are affiliated with a second street gang roughly 16 members strong.\nAt a news conference Thursday evening, McClendon's grandmother, Rhonda McDowell, said her family will stand by whatever punishment's meted out by the criminal justice system.\n\"I feel they took Aiden away from us, so whatever their punishment is, whatever the prosecutors decided... we're going to be fine with it,\" McDowell said.\nGarrett Pelican contributed to this report.\nAiden's grandmother: prayed for an arrest to be made @FCN2go pic.twitter.com/NmZjB6jR3e\n\u2014 Janny Rodriguez (@JRodriguezFCN) March 10, 2016\n(\u00a9 2017 WTLV)"}
