He was rushed into surgery at UF Health Jacksonville where he was pronounced dead the next day.\nSheriff Williams said Thursday McClendon was not the intended target of the shooting, which was the product of an ongoing gang feud stemming from online rap videos.\nInstead, the sheriff said, the shooters were targeting the toddler's cousin, 19-year-old Reginald Williams, who's affiliated with one gang, which has an estimated 65 members, many of which are incarcerated. Authorities say the shooters are affiliated with a second street gang roughly 16 members strong.\nWilson was sentenced to 144 days in jail for a possession of a firearm by a convicted felon charge.\nThe State's Attorney Office says this is still an active investigation."}
