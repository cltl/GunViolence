That was until he was murdered in a Whitehaven shooting spree.\nShe cannot help but cry by the teddy bears and the flowers that mark the son where her son was killed.\n\"It's been real hard to get up,\" she said. \"Sometimes I feel like I'm not going to make it. I miss my son so much.\"\nA shooting broke out at the Birch Leaf Apartments in Whitehaven on the evening of September 18.\nInvestigators have not revealed the motive behind the shooting, but six people were shot. Five survived but LaTonia's son, Deonte, did not.\n\"I see it on TV, on the First 48. And I just never thought this would be me going through this,\" she said.\nLaTonia says she still does not know whether her son was targeted, a random victim, or caught in the middle of something. She wants answers.\n\"Six people got shot. Somebody knows something. It's been a nightmare for my family,\" she said. \"And it's sad, that no one will come and say anything. I just want whoever did it locked up.\"\nInvestigators ask anyone who can help solve this case to call Crime Stoppers at 901-528-CASH.\nCopyright 2013 WMC-TV. All rights reserved."}
