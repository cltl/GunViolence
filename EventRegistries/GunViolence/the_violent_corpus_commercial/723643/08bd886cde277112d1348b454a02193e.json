Because that man got a family.\u201d\nThree of the victims were taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center and two were taken to Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital, officials said.\n\u201cHe was a real cool person. Everybody loved him,\u201d Brooks said.\nWitnesses said they heard between 20 and 30 shots fired during the incident.\nThe incident comes after two fatal shootings in the Pine Hills neighborhood in the past few weeks.\nSunday's shooting took place less than five minutes from another Pine Hills shooting scene last week that resulted in the death of a 27-year-old mother, who was caught in the crossfire.\nKendra Lewis was sitting in her car at a gas station with her 5-year-old child when she was hit by a bullet during a nearby shootout Wednesday.\nShe died the next day.\nGregory Whitbeck, 55, was shot and killed as he walked into a Pine Hills dialysis center on Dec. 2.\nTwo people have been arrested and charged in each incident.\nCity Commissioner Regina Hill wrote a statement on her Facebook page, saying in part, \u201cI'm starting to believe we do need a curfew for kids under 18.\u201d\nHill told Channel 9 that she will talk to other city council members to get their opinions about the suggested curfew.\n\u201cI know it sounds pretty radical, but I'm not alone,\u201d said Hill.\nThe killing did not happen in her district, but Hill said now is the time to consider all options to try to end the violence.\n\u201cWe've tried everything else. I need to see if this may work,\u201d she said.\nThe names and conditions of the four victims who remained hospitalized after Sunday\u2019s shooting were not released.\nMore stories on WFTV.com:\n\u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group."}
