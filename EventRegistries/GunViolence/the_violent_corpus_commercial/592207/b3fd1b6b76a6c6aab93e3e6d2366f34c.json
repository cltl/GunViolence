That request was denied.\nLas Vegas Metro police say Jason Dej-Oudom killed his wife and three children before taking his own life.\n[READ: 3 juveniles among 5 dead in Vegas apparent murder-suicide]\nThe victim, Gayle Dej-Oudom, worked at a Sports Clips haircut salon up until about a week before the murder-suicide.\n\u201cShe was awesome. She was amazing, the nicest person. [She was] full of life,\u201d said Allyson Wall, Gayle Dej-Oudom\u2019s former co-worker.\nThe victim\u2019s co-workers said they lost a family member in the incident.\n\u201cI was here at work, doing a haircut with one of her regulars, actually, and we both just kind of lost it. We just started crying,\u201d Wall said.\nGayle Dej-Oudom quit her job about a week before her murder. She told co-workers she was afraid of her husband.\n\u201cWhen asked why, she said that she had feared for her life and she couldn\u2019t be anywhere that he could fine her,\u201d Wall said.\nCo-workers said they knew little about her abusive relationship. Before she quit, she filed for a temporary protective order that would have made it illegal for her husband to come near her.\nA court denied that request on June 9.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I just don\u2019t know when you have that kind of evidence how you can be denied a restraining order,\u201d Wall said.\n\u201cThe criticism of TPOs is that they\u2019re not taken seriously enough, that they\u2019re not reviewed closely enough, and I suspect there\u2019s a high volume of TPO requests,\u201d FOX5 legal analyst Bob Massi said.\nMassi said that high volume of request comes from people abusing the system, seeking orders when they aren\u2019t in danger.\n\u201cThe people who review these, they see it all, and they have to use some gut feeling. Obviously in this case, for whatever reason, it was denied,\u201d Massi said.\nCo-workers aren\u2019t convinced a protective order would have saved their friend.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that would\u2019ve done anything. I think he was going to do what he did no matter what,\u201d Wall said.\nCopyright 2016 KVVU (KVVU Broadcasting Corporation). All rights reserved."}
