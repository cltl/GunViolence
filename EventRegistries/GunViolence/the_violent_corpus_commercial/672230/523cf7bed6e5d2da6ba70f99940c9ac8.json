Ed Crosby said. The 11-month-old girl was wounded in the shoulder. She was expected to recover.\n\u201cI would characterize it as a major miracle,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a traumatic injury but it wouldn\u2019t have taken but a few millimeters to be something far more serious.\u201d\nThe shooting, reported about 6:15 p.m., appeared accidental. Police did not arrest the father, who was not identified. Crosby said the father was \u201cbeside himself\u201d over the shooting and cooperating with the investigation. Officers were still conducting interviews and finalizing their findings for Sonoma County District Attorney\u2019s prosecutors, who would make the final determination about whether there was any criminal negligence.\n\u201cThe question is whether that accident could have been avoided and, if so, whether that rises to the level of a criminal case,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cThere are a whole lot of factors that need to be weighed.\u201d\nThe child\u2019s parents were in the master bedroom preparing to go out that night, with a babysitter in another room, when the incident occurred. The child was with her mother on the bed and crawling around when the father retrieved the gun from a nightstand to ensure \u201cit didn\u2019t have a round in the chamber and was safe to leave at home,\u201d Crosby said.\n\u201cHe was handling it with the intention of making it safe and then it went off,\u201d Crosby said.\nThe bullet hit the child\u2019s left shoulder from behind and exited through the top of the chest. It passed through the top of the mattress, according to police. Officers found the bullet, intact with a full metal jacket, in the closet, Crosby said.\nThe girl was rushed to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital then airlifted to Children\u2019s Hospital.\nCrosby said the father had experience with firearms but did not currently or previously work in law enforcement.\nCrosby said he would not yet release the father\u2019s name because police were still conducting interviews in the case.\nYou can reach Staff Writer Julie Johnson at 707-521-5220 or julie.johnson@pressdemocrat.com.
