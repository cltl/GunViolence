Police learned later that the shooting occurred inside the child's house, and they initially reported the gunshot wound was in the child's hand.\nThe child's father, Tevin Tyson, 24, told detectives that the wound was self-inflicted after the boy handled a pistol from Tyson's backpack.\nHe was transported to Vanderbilt Children's Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.\nTyson, a licensed security guard who has a handgun permit, reported that when he and his son got home Tuesday evening, both placed their backpacks on the floor of their apartment in the Glastonbury Woods complex on Glastonbury Road. Tyson's backpack contained a .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol.\nTyson said he told his son to retrieve clothing from the child's backpack and turned away.\nThen he heard the gunshot.\nTyson loaded the child into his vehicle and was taking him to a hospital when he saw a Metro police officer on Briley Parkway at the I-24 interchange and asked for help.\nThe case will be given to the DA to determine whether charges will be brought.\nReach Ariana Sawyer at 615-259-8382 or on Twitter @a_maia_sawyer.\n(Photo: Ariana Sawyer / The Tennessean)"}
