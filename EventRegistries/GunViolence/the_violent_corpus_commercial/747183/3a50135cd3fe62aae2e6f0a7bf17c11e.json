Her daughter lived with her father in Bogota, Colombia, and was visiting for the holidays, according to neighbors.\nNeighbors told Local 10 News that they saw Joseph close the hurricane shutters in the middle of the night and then they heard gunshots and screaming.\nJoe Gresham told Local 10 News that his daughter often played with Akakili.\n\"I have an 8-year-old and she was only 9. That's horrible, man,\" he said.\nThe mother and daughter were discovered by Akakili's father, who works for the U.S. government in Colombia.\nWitnesses said the home was locked when he arrived, so he called a relative to open the door. When he walked in, he discovered their bodies in a bedroom.\n\"She might have been battling something that's unknown to the family at this time,\" Joseph's brother, Tony Williams, said.\n\"It's gut wrenching,\" Gresham said. \"What's more gut wrenching (is) she (is) an adult. She can do what she wants, but when you think about the kid, that gets you.\"\nAuthorities have not confirmed the victims' cause of death.\nCopyright 2017 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved."}
