(18 NEWS) -\nThe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has charged a Schuyler County man in connection to a hunting incident involving the man's stepbrother last month.\nAccording to the DEC, 27-year-old Scott Brooks of Beaver Dams is charged with Second Degree Assault, Reckless Endangerment, and Hunting Deer Outside of Legal Hours. The charges are a felony, misdemeanor, and violation, respectively.\nThe charges stem from an incident in the Town of Dix on Nov. 19 when the DEC says Brooks shot his stepbrother while hunting. The DEC says Brooks illegally fired his hunting rifle two hours before legal hunting time at what he believed to be a deer, but it was actually his 24-year-old stepbrother.\nThe man who suffered the gunshot wound survived, but did need surgery that day.\nBrooks pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released. He's scheduled to appear back in Town of Dix court in January.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
