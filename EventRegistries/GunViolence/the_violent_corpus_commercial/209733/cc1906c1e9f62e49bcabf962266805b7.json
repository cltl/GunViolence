Lake County deputies arrested a man in connection with the incident.\nThe boy was reportedly shot in the torso Wednesday night and taken in a personal vehicle to St. Luke's in Ronan where he died.\nLake County officials say the incident happened at a home off Eagle Trail Pass. It's northeast of Ninepipes, off Highway 93, north of Missoula.\nDeputies arrested a man in connection with the shooting. Authorities won't release the suspect's relationship to the victim.\nThey say the shooting is being investigated as an accident, but witness statements led to Thursday afternoon's arrest.\n\"It's still being considered an accident, but like with other accidents in the past, there can be charges filed because of the accident,\" said Lake County Sheriff Public Information Officer Karen Sergeant.\nNeighbors say activity at the home doesn't appear to them like an average family routine.\nThe unidentified 3-year-old was shot with a small-caliber gun just before 8:30 Wednesday night. The police response frightened one neighbor.\n\"It's a little nerve-wracking. We locked everything up tight last night just because we don't know what's going on,\" said Tanya Gray.\nNeighbors don't know the family very well. They say this is a sad situation and this isn't the first time police have been called to the home. One neighbor questioned the safety of children there.\n\"There's been activities going on for the last few years and there's been activities that probably aren't conducive with having children in the home. There's been police at that home many times since we've been here over the past several years,\" said Chris Cheff.\nCheff has seen children running on the roof of a trailer that sits on the property. \"Kids doing things that aren't probably very safe,\" said Cheff.\nGray only saw the 3-year-old gunshot victim outside once.\n\"The only time I ever saw him was during the daytime, about in the afternoon and he was in a diaper -- no shirt, no shoes, just kind of hanging out on the stairs by the front door, and then later I'd see him by the vehicle that's there sometimes,\" said Gray.\nBut what she's seen outside of the house, doesn't seem to have a consistent schedule.\n\"There are different kids that come and go in there. Because I'm a stay-at-home mom, I've been retired for three years, I see kids out at all different ages at all different times of the day,\" said Gray.\nGray says adults are usually inside, rarely out with the kids. She says the father is an artist.\n\"The gentleman that owns it is a very talented artist. He does metal sculpture work and they're absolutely gorgeous,\" said Gray.\nGray also says the father seemed to be the only one who stayed in the house full-time.\nPolice are still investigating.\nLake County is still treating this as an accident and no charges have been filed at this time."}
