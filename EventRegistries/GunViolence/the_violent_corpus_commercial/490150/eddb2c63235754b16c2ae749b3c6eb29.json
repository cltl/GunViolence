Reid has remained behind bars at the Charleston County Detention Center for over a month since being charged with first-degree murder for the Jun. 29 shooting at Cycle Gear, located at 4400 Dorchester Road.\nNorth Charleston Police Department investigators say Reid shot and killed 41-year-old Maurice Lamark Horry during a melee outside the shop between two rival motorcycle clubs, the Columbia-based Real Kingz and the Wheels of Soul.\nPolice say Horry was being attacked by a number of men inside the store, so he ran out to his motorcycle in the parking lot and grabbed his gun from under the seat. Police say witnesses told them Horry pointed his gun at a large group of men assembled outside and ordered them to back away.\nInvestigators say Reid then shot Horry, but Reid\u2019s attorneys say that is not the case. According to them, witnesses say Horry shot first, and struck Reid. Attorneys argue that Reid, who has a concealed weapons permit, was acting in self-defense when he returned fire.\nReid\u2019s attorneys also argue he was not part of the initial confrontation inside the store which prompted the fracas, and had only just arrived at the parking lot when Horry began firing shots. Reid\u2019s attorneys say he was attending a fundraising cookout at Norton & Son\u2019s Auto-Detailing Shop across the street just before accompanying his friend, 36-year-old Summerville man Theodore Waymeyers Jr. to go purchase a helmet.\nReid is the only man charged in the triple-shooting, which also left Waymeyers and another man, 39-year-old Carlos Davis, of Columbia, dead.\nReid\u2019s attorneys argue Davis and Waymeyers died from shots fired by Horry.\nTwo other men have been arrested in connection with the incident. Barry Stinson, 32, and Derry Domonic Gadson, 39, were charged with second-degree assault by mob for allegedly starting the disturbance by assaulting Horry and another man inside the shop.\nPolice say their investigation into the incident is ongoing.\nReid\u2019s attorneys describe him as a devoted husband, father and model citizen who has never been charged with a violent crime, with a disorderly conduct charge from 1990 providing the only blemish on his record."}
