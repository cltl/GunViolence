The baby was rushed to a nearby hospital for surgery, she said.\nThe child\u2019s father, Pedro Rosales, 47, told officers the gun accidentally discharged as he was cleaning it inside their apartment in Brooklyn\u2019s East New York neighborhood, striking his daughter.\nHe was arrested on charges of assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon.\nThe baby\u2019s mother, Jessica Aguilar, 24, who was home during the incident, was also arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and acting in a manner injurious to a child, the police spokeswoman said.\nIt was unclear if the couple had attorneys or how they intended to plead to the charges at an arraignment this week.\nThe incident came a day after a 3-year-old boy in Washington state was shot in the mouth, apparently by a 4-year-old neighbor, as the two played in the wounded child\u2019s Lake Stevens home, local law enforcement officials said.\n(Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere; Editing by Frances Kerry)"}
