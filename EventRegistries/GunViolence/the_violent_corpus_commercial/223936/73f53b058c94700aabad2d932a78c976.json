She was listed in stable condition and is expected to recover, CBS2\u2019s Tracee Carrasco reported.\n\u201cI\u2019m just praying that the child is OK,\u201d neighbor Tiffany Sanders said.\n\u201cI\u2019m very hurt,\u201d another neighbor said. \u201cIt was a 9-month-old baby, and it\u2019s sad. Very sad.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened in the house.

The current penalty for illegal possession of a loaded weapon is 3 1/2 to 15 years.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to have a culture where illegal guns are in homes or premises with children,\u201d Adams said. \u201cChildren should be around toys, not weapons.\u201d\nPolice said Rosales has been previously arrested on weapons-related charges.\nRosales and Aguilar were expected to be arraigned at Brooklyn Criminal Court overnight, Carrasco reported.\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories"}
