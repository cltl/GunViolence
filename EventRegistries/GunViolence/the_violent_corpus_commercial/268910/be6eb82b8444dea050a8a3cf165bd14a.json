He was a father of two kids. He didn't bother nobody, whoever shot him, why and what reason,\u201d Debra Cunningham said.\nNo arrests have been made, but police are working several leads and have several people of interest.\nNearby residents also expressed their concerns over the shooting.\n\u201cA young man lost his life last night; a few more young men were shot. No matter, no difference what they represented or what anyone says, they are still black people and we're supposed to come together in unity and love one another,\u201d Eric Leggings said.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Waynesboro Police Department."}
