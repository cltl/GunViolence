East Precinct police were dispatched. They talked to the victim\u2019s boyfriend, who they found \u201cpacing outside the emergency room.\u201d The report says he told them it happened in his car at 27th SW and SW Cambridge [map]. He and his girlfriend were in the car with friends of his; one friend, he said, had a gun and while saying \u201csomething similar to \u2018we\u2019re going to be brothers for life\u2019,\u201d racked the slide on his pistol, and it fired, going through the front passenger seat and through the girl\u2019s chest. They drove to the hospital. Police talked to the girl just before she was taken into surgery and reported that \u201cshe made statements consistent with the gunshot being accidental.\u201d They found a bullet hole, bullet, and blood in the car, which was impounded. Police later met with the man whose gun fired; he was arrested and booked into the King County Jail for investigation of assault.\nADDED 9:54 AM TUESDAY: We now have the probable-cause document from the 18-year-old suspect\u2019s bail hearing Monday afternoon. He is a Rainier Valley resident and was released on personal recognizance. The document says that he told police a different story about the gunshot \u2013 that he got into the car, noticed a gun on the floor, picked it up with the intent of throwing it out the window, and that, he said, was when it went off. He said he then gave it to his brother, who also was in the car, and told him to get rid of it, adding that he doesn\u2019t know what happened to the gun. He has no criminal record in online statewide files."}
