Police believe the incident was due to an accidental discharge.\nOn November 6, authorities were called to the Baptist Health Madisonville Emergency Room to investigate a gunshot victim.\nOnce police officers arrived, 18-year-old De'angelique McRath told the officers he was walking home from the basketball courts at Festus Claybon Park around 4:45 p.m. when he heard a shot and felt the impact of the bullet.\nHe says he was alone walking west on Elm St. approaching Pride Ave. when he was shot.\nHe then reportedly ran to his residence on Noel Ave. where he was transported to the Emergency Room.\nMcRath was treated and released from the Emergency Room that evening, according to police.\nNo neighbors or residents on Elm St. reported hearing a gunshot that afternoon.\nAfter further investigation, officers determined the victim was actually a passenger in a vehicle going west on Highway 41-A. The back seat passenger accidentally discharged a handgun into the back of the victim's seat, according to officers. The bullet reportedly traveled through the seat, striking the victim in the right shoulder blade.\nMadisonville Police say the public can be assured that no one is indiscriminately shooting at people.\nMcRath was charged with falsely reporting an incident on Wednesday.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
