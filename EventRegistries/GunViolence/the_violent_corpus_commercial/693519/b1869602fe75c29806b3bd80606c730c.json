Monroe said detectives believe the shooters only targeted the woman, who suffered a graze wound to the shoulder, as a potential witness to the first shooting.\nMonroe called it a callous and brazen act that would not be tolerated.\n\"Something like this is just not acceptable,\" she said. \"No act of violence is acceptable, but this was brazen, it was a callous, it was in broad daylight.\n\"They did it with no regard for who was around,\" she added.\nThe victim's name was Derrick Hickman, said his father, Johnnie, who was also on the porch at the time of the shooting.\n\"We were just talking, and the next thing you knew it was gunfire,\" he said.\nHe said he scrambled for cover behind a treadmill, but the shooters were intent on his son, his youngest. \"There wasn't nothing I could do because they were shooting so many times.\"\nHickman said his son tried to escape into the house, but the shooters continued firing repeatedly through the door. The bottom was riddled with holes. On the top a note read, \"Family is where life begins and love never ends.\"\nThe injured baby was Derrick's stepson, Hickman said, adding that he does not know what prompted the violence.\n\"I can't understand what happened,\" he said.\nPolice, who are still looking for a \"concrete motive,\" intend to go door to door, canvassing the neighborhood for clues, and will review surveillance video, said Monroe, who asked that people with information call police.\n\"We have to close this case,\" she said. \"Things like this just cannot happen.\"\nAnyone with information is urged to contact homicide detectives, at 410-396-2100.
