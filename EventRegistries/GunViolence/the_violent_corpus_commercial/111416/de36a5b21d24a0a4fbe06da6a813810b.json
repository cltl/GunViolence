Allen told the court that Obsorne is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\"He is forced to live and walk around with the memory that will not go away,\" she said. \"He has a hard time sleeping, and he has nightmares over what happened.\"\nAllen also said Osborne must continue to live with his decisions.\n\"Going through the guilt and the grief is intense,\" she said. \"He has to carry that guilt for the rest of his life.\"\nIn other terms of his probation, Osborne will not be able to leave the state, unless he has approval from his probation officer. He can't possess a firearm, and any weapon in his house must be locked and away from his possession.\nHe also can't consume alcohol or illegal drugs.\n\"If you violate the terms of your probation, I can re-sentence you,\" Hauptman told Osborne. \"We could be right back in here.\"\nOsborne was charged with reckless conduct for accidentally shooting Anderson, 15, in the chest on March 1, 2014, while handling a gun at the Obsorne home.\nAssistant State's Attorney Carol Linkowski had originally asked Hauptman to sentence Osbourne to juvenile detention.\n\"He went into his father's closet to look for an air pump to play basketball, and he found the gun,\" Linkowski said. \"He could have just left the gun on the shelf.\"\nThe last person to speak before the judge gave his ruling, Osborne looked at Anderson's family and told them how sorry he is.\n\"Matt is gone because of me,\" Osborne said. \"I love you all, and I am sorry.\"\nThe teenager's words were met with tears from the Anderson and Osborne families.\nJennifer Anderson, Matt's mother, tearfully addressed the court.\n\"This has effected our family in so many ways,\" she said. \"Since Matt's death, our world has been turned upside down.\"\nShe said her son will not be able to experience life's moments, like driving a car.\n\"Matt was really looking forward to driving a car,\" she said. \"He will never drive, go to prom, graduate high school, graduate college, or have kids. He will never have that chance, since Brady picked up a loaded gun.\""}
