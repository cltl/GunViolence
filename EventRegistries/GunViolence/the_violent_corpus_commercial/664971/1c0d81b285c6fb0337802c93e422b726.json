Brock got to the elementary school moments before other officers could respond to a 911 call.\nBy the time Brock reached the playground, first-grade teacher Meghan Hollingsworth and Jacob Hall and another boy had been wounded.\nMcAdams said Brock took the shooter down, and he did not mention the gun.\nOfficials would not comment on whether Brock\u2019s gun remained holstered or if it was used in the takedown.\nHollingsworth and the other first-grader were treated and released the day of the shooting.\nJacob suffered a severe brain injury caused by blood loss and died over the weekend.\nBrock has not spoken publicly about the shooting, but he released a statement saying: \"The true heroes of (the) senseless tragedy are the teachers that put their lives on the line to protect their students, the principal who through fears of her own did what\u2019s right to ensure the safety of the school. They deserve to be called heroes, and to them I tip my hat.\""}
