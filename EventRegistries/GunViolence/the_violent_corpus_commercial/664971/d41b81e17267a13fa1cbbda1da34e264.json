That attack followed a shooting at a home a few miles from the school in which the teen's father was killed.\nThe teen is being held at the Greenville County Detention Center Juvenile Facility, Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said.\nThe shooting happened shortly before 2 p.m. at Townville Elementary School at 105 State Road in Townville in Anderson County, Lt. Sheila Cole, with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office, said.\nACSO Capt. Garland Major said one of the 6-year-old boys was shot in the foot, the other in the leg and first-grade teacher Meghan Hollingsworth in the shoulder.\nOne of the injured boys, Jacob Hall, was airlifted to Greenville Memorial Hospital where he underwent surgery Wednesday afternoon. Jacob died Saturday at 12:56 p.m., Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said.\nThe second boy and the teacher, Meghan Hollingsworth, were taken by ambulance to AnMed. They were treated and released Wednesday, Ross Norton with AnMed said.\nA note on the door of Hollingsworth's home Thursday morning said her family appreciates people's concern. But she asks those coming to her home to respect their privacy. The note says she's not interested in giving any interviews.\nA truck, believed to have been driven by the teen, crashed into a fence surrounding the playground and was left there.\nAnderson County Deputy Chief Keith Smith said the shooting happened on the playground and the shooter never got inside the school.\nJamie Brock, 30-year veteran volunteer firefighter who responded to the school after the shooting, took down the suspect on the playground, Smith said.\nBrock was not armed, officials said.\nSheriff John Skipper said Brock likely prevented more shots from being fired by confronting the shooter and taking him down.\n\"Mr. Brock is a big fellow,\" Skipper said.\nScott Stoller, with Anderson County Emergency Medical Services, said Brock wants to stay quiet and humble, and said he did \"what any other firefighter would do.\"\nThe teen was armed with a handgun, ACSO Capt. Garland Major said. He said the shooting had no racial or terrorist undertones.\nInvestigators said there is no known relationship between the suspected shooter and the victims at the school.\nArmed officers were at the school about seven minutes after the call and the suspect was in custody in less than an hour, officials said.\nShooting suspect's father found dead\nThe Anderson County Coroner's Office is also investigating the death of the shooter's father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Dewitt Osborne at his home on Osborne Road in Townville. The location is a little more than 3 miles from school.\nJeffrey Osborne was shot to death, Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said.\nThe teen is the suspect in his father's death, Skipper said.\nShore said the teen called his grandparents on his cellphone at 1:44 p.m. The grandmother said he was crying and so upset she couldn't understand him, so she and her husband went to Osborne's home to see if their grandson was there. The grandson was not there, but they found their son's body.\nAt 1:45 p.m., a teacher called to report the shooting at the school.\nOsborne's wife released a statement Thursday morning through her pastor.

Nikki Haley released a statement saying: \"As we work together with law enforcement to make sure they have the support they need to investigate what happened in Townville, Michael and I ask that everyone across South Carolina join us in praying for the entire Townville Elementary School family and those touched by today's tragedy.\"\nHaley arrived in the Upstate Wednesday evening, but she did not make any public appearances.\nMoments of panic for parents\nAfter the shooting, students were evacuated and moved by bus to Oakdale Baptist Church at 6724 Highway 24 in Townville.\nJamie Meredith, a student\u2019s mother, spoke to News 4\u2019s Mandy Gaither just after she was reunited with her daughter.\n\"I just pray for those families. I pray for those kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI thank God it wasn't mine, but I feel so bad for them and I'm just going to pray that they're OK and I don\u2019t know if they're my daughter's classmates or they're somebody I knew. I don't know. (I) just feel so bad.\n\u201cShe said they went in the bathroom. I don't know how they knew to go in the bathroom, but I know her teacher was shaken up. I know all the kids were scared. There was a bunch of kids crying. She didn't talk for about five minutes when I got her.\n\u201cI'm just so scared. I don't even want her to go to school now.\"\nA prayer service was held at the church Wednesday night.
