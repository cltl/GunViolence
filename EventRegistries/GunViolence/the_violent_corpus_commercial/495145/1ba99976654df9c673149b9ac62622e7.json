(There were) a fair number of rounds fired out here, so (this is) really pretty brazen stuff on the street corner at that time of day.\"\nWhent told the newspaper he was unsure at this point if all were the intended targets, or if some of the victims - all men between the ages of 23 and 31 - were innocent bystanders.\nAs of Tuesday morning, one of the men was still in critical condition and six were in stable condition at both Highland Hospital in Oakland and Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley. They all were expected to live.\nStill, the number of gunshots fired - and right about dinnertime - had many people on edge.\nPolice Officer Johnna Watson said the city's ShotSpotter system and multiple phone calls of shots fired near the corner of 96th Avenue and Olive Street sent police scrambling to the intersection just after 6:08 p.m.\nOfficers found multiple victims in the sidewalk area there, and more victims turned up at a hospital a short time later.\nNo motive has been established and no suspects have been arrested.\nWatson said police believe that people in the area witnessed the shooting and are urging anyone with information to contact Oakland police by texting TIP OAKLANDPD to 888777 from your cell phone or call the toll-free tip hotline at 855-TIPS-247 (855-847-7247).\nPublished at 7:38 PM PST on Nov 25, 2013 | Updated at 11:45 AM PST on Nov 26, 2013\nMore stories from NBC Bay Area:\n\u00bb Pokemon Go Players Invade SF to \"Catch Them All\"\n\u00bb McDonald's Set to Sell Gilroy Garlic Fries\n\u00bb BART Has Shortage of Computer Systems Engineers\n\u00bb Fact Checking Day Two of the Republican National Convention\n\u00bb Driver Leads CHP on Chase, Ends at Jail\n\u00bb Overturned Big-Rig on Richmond Bridge Snarls Traffic\n\u00bb Giants Drop Fifth Straight in Slugfest at Fenway Park\n\u00bb Interns Capture Compelling, Historic Moments\n\u00bb BART Service Restored After Truck on Tracks Causes Delays\n\u00bb Man Who Saved 2 Girls Recounts Tragedy in Hawaiian Tidepool"}
