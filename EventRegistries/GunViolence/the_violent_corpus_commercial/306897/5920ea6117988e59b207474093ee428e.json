Still in the very early stages of the investigation,\" said Officer Ralph Woolfolk with Atlanta police.\nAll five victims were eventually taken to the hospital with one person in critical condition, according to police.\nA spokesperson with Atlanta police said late Saturday that one of the victims was treated and released from the hospital.\nPolice said at least 50 bullets were fired. Neighbors told CBS46's Dontaye Carter that they rushed to make sure their children were on the ground when the shooting started.\n\"I'm just glad me or my kids weren't one of those statistics. Like I said, it's dangerous and its kids getting shot, you know kids killing kids and it's shouldn't even be like that,\" said a woman who asked to be called Chyna.\nThe victims are expected to make a full recovery.\nNo one is in custody at this time.\nCopyright 2015 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).
