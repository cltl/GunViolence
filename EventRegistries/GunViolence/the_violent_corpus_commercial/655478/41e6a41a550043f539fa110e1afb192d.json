Sumter deputies previously wanted to discuss the case with Christopher Lavell Sinkler. They now say Sinkler came to the Sheriff's Office on his own and spoke with investigators. Sinkler is no longer considered a person of interest.\nWitnesses tell deputies that they knocked on a door when the person inside opened the door and tried to pull them into the residence. The group says as they ran away from the home, someone shot Dinkins.\nDeputies say anyone who has information on the case call CrimeStoppers at 1-888-CRIME-SC, or text the word \"TIPSC\" plus your message to 274637. Tips may also be submitted on the CrimeStoppers website.\n(\u00a9 2017 WLTX)"}
