Don't no parent want to go through nothing like that.\"\nKingston says that he was a big boy and that he didn't even cry when he got shot.\nPolice have not said if the shooting was targeted or a random attack.\nThere were other people inside of the home during the shooting.\nPamela Jenkins says she heard the gun shots.\n\"I heard them. But it sound like it was from a distance. I didn't jump, I didn't do anything because it sound like it was down the street, around the corner,\" Jenkins explained. \"Stop the violence. Petty, petty violence. Lives matter.\"\nLittle Kingston is a warrior. His dad says he took the bullet like a champ.\n\"I don't even think he know what happened. I don't think he know he got shot. When the paramedic asked him what happened. He said I'm fine. I get shot all the time on call to duty, a little video game he playing, so it really didn't phase him.\"\nIf you have any information that could help police track down the person or people responsible, call Crimestoppers or Jackson Police.\nCopyright 2016 MSNewsNow.
