The report said Adrian Garcia-Guevara, 28, of Lubbock was arrested for injury to a child, false report and several other charges.\nDecastro brought the child to University Medical Center. UMC called police to let officers know that a BB pellet was removed from the back of the child\u2019s head.\nThe police report said Decastro claimed to live in California and the family was passing through Lubbock. Jail records indicated Decastro lives in Lubbock.\nThe police report said Decastro told police that other children accidentally shot the 11-month-old. Police didn\u2019t believe her and told her so.\nThe report said Decastro changed her story. She claimed the child stepped in front of Garcia-Guevara while the BB gun was fired and it was an accidental shooting. Then Decastro claimed Garcia-Guevara accidentally shot the child inside the kitchen of a home in the 300 block of Waco. Again, police didn\u2019t believe her.\nPolice eventually came to believe that Garcia-Guevara shot the child with a BB gun. Police discovered a second child in the home who had been shot in the hand. The second child needed surgery to remove the BB according to the police report.\nA third child was not shot with a BB gun. However, the two older children suffered extensive bruising according to the report. Aside from the 11-month-old, ages were not listed except to say these were children under the age of 14.\nDecastro and Garcia-Guevara were booked into the Lubbock County Detention Center. Decastro was able to post bond to be released. Garcia-Guevara was still locked up on Monday.\nChildren\u2019s Protective Services took custody of the children."}
