At 11:50 a.m., the children\u2019s grandparents went to get them off the bus and found their parents\u2019 cars still at the home.\nThe grandparents called the Stokes County Sheriff\u2019s Office to do a welfare check and deputies found all four deceased.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always tough any time you're dealing with young people,\u201d said Sheriff Mike Marshall.\nThe Sheriff\u2019s Department has not determined a motive for the killings nor have they identified the killer.\nThe Tarpleys had family that lived next door. They did not want to be interviewed.\nOther neighbors are in shock. Amy Parsons was lifelong friends with the father. She said he was always quick to help out friends in need.\n\u201cI just felt sick to my stomach for the kids the little children in there,\u201d said Parsons. \u201cIt just breaks your heart.\u201d\nParsons lives across the street from the Tarpleys\u2019 home. She said she never noticed any marital problems and said Coleton loved his special-needs son Charlie immensely.\n\u201cColeton revamped the whole inside of the house just to accommodate Charlie, you know; if there was something Charlie needed he would build it for him,\u201d said Parsons.\nAnother neighbor, Patricia Stark, was also shocked by the crime just two doors down from her home. She said she didn't hear anything out of the ordinary Tuesday night or Wednesday morning.\n\u201cMy heart goes out to the family members of those people because that is horrible,\u201d said Stark. \u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d"}
