The boy got access to a loaded gun, and fired it, hitting the girl in the back of the neck.\nPolice responded to the 400 block of Glenwood Avenue shortly after 9:30 a.m. Monday and found the girl. She is expected to live.\n\u201cI think we have a tragedy very narrowly averted,\u201d detective Jay Fulton of Columbus Police said.\nNeighbors watched in disbelief as the little girl was taken away in a medic.\n\u201cI wanted to go to the emergency room with her so badly but they wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d neighbor Sandra Myers said. \u201cIt hurts so bad I couldn\u2019t go. And I wanted also to go comfort the little boy.\u201d\nOthers in the neighborhood say this hits too close to home. Amber Litton said it \u201cbreaks (her) heart.\u201d\n\u201cI have a 5-year-old,\u201d she said. \u201c(It\u2019s) something I couldn\u2019t imagine going through.\u201d\nPolice say no charges have been filed, but investigators will do interviews before taking the information to the city attorney\u2019s office.\nWhat investigators say at this point is if you have a gun, know where it is and make sure that is away from kids.\n\u201cIf you have guns in the home and small children, make it inaccessible,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cIf they see you handle it, the minute you are gone they\u2019ll handle it.\u201d\nPlease install the latest Adobe Flash Player Plugin to watch this content.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
