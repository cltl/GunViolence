An ambulance rushed him to the hospital. Police say the boy is expected to survive the injury.\nNeighbors say it's not unusual for the boy to play with other young children in the back yard, and neighbors report seeing police and other children searching the yard following the shooting.\n\"There\u2019s children in the backyard, two children probably not big enough to go to school,\" said Bridget Law, who lives across the street. \"They were outside and the policemen are with them. The children are searching for something on the ground. I don\u2019t know what they were looking for, it was awful.\"\nLawrence police declined to say whether this is a case of children playing with a firearm or if an adult was involved in somehow mishandling a gun. Detectives are interviewing family members to determine what exactly happened.\nNone of the neighbors told FOX 4 that they heard a gunshot. They all agree though that parents need to take precautions when firearms and young children are under the same roof."}
