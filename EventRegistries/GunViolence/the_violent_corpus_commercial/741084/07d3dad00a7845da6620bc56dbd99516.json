She sat down on a bench across from the Driskill Hotel to rest her feet, and called her son at 12:03 a.m. to wish him a Happy New Year.\n\u201cAs soon as I hung up the phone we heard a loud bang out of nowhere,\u201d said Rocha. \u201cAt the time I didn\u2019t realize I was hit.\u201d\nWhen she tried to get up she could tell something was wrong.\n\u201cIt was kind of numb and I could feel it burning like a hotness to my leg,\u201d said Rocha.\nAustin Travis County EMS rushed her to the hospital where Rocha says doctors removed a 45 caliber bullet that had traveled from the front of her left thigh to the back.\nAustin police said they believe it was a falling bullet that came from someone firing a gun into the air nearby\n\u201cI\u2019m just left with why, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Rocha wiping tears from her eyes.\nThere are currently no suspects in the case and detectives are expected to be reviewing video footage to see if they can spot the person who pulled the trigger.\nA HALO camera is on the corner recording around the clock and and providing a live feed to Austin police.\nThe Driskill Hotel also has surveillance cameras. The head of security tells KXAN APD looked at their footage, but didn\u2019t see much.\nOfficers stationed at the hotel, along with employees at nearby bars say they didn\u2019t see or hear anything either other than a loud crowd in the packed street.\n\u201cNot a way to start the year, but thank God it wasn\u2019t worse,\u201d said Rocha. \u201cI really hope that they find the owner of the gun or that somebody comes forward.\u201d\nIn the meantime, the mother of four will be home recovering and is unable to go back to work until her leg heals. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help with medical expenses.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
