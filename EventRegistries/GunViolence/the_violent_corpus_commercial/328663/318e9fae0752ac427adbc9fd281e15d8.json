Paul White said in a statement.\nEssex Rescue later transported the boy to the University of Vermont Medical Center for treatment. He was admitted with a non-life-threatening wound to the left leg and is expected to recover fully, said White, the state police commander for northwestern Vermont.\nTroopers spoke to the father at the fire station and also processed the shooting scene, the police said. The property is owned by the victim's family.\nWhite said the preliminary investigation revealed the following:\nThe boy, his father and two other children were taking turns shooting at a target with a .22 caliber pistol, under the supervision of the father.\nWhile the boy was shooting, the handgun failed to discharge. The child subsequently lowered the still-loaded firearm, but before his father could intervene, the gun discharged. The bullet hit the boy in the lower leg, White said.\nOnce the investigation is complete, the case will be forwarded to the Chittenden County State's Attorney's Office for review."}
