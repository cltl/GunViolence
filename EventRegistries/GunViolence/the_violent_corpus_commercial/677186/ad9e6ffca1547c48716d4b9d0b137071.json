A police officer attempted CPR, but Eric Summerfield died at the scene.\n\"He had a life ahead of him,\" says Melanie Whittaker, a family friend.\n\"He'd just give a shirt off his back to anybody that needed it,\" says Melanie's husband, Chris Whittaker. Eric used to spend a lot of time with the Whittaker's children. They called him 'Uncle Eric' despite no blood relation.\nToday, they are heartbroken.\n\"We loved him,\" says Donald Oakley, Eric's former step-father.\n\"Yep, innocent life gone,\" says Melanie.\nEric had just graduated from Forsyth high school this year.\n\"His little baby brother, his mom was telling us last night, that's the only word he could say, Eric.
