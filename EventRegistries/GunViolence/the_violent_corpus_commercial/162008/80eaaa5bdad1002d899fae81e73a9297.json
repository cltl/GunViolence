Sounded like there was an actual war going on right here in our neighborhood at our front door.\"\nThe concrete column on Miller's front porch was caught in the crossfire of whizzing bullets.\nInvestigators say the teens who were shot were in an SUV, driven by Porshia Malone. She says she was giving her cousins and his friends a ride to a party.\n\"We just heard it and then when we looked over, the man was like this just shooting at my car with some long gun, and I panicked. I put my head down. My cousin just threw me out,\" Malone said. \"I feel lucky to be alive. I feel like it wasn't my time, but everything happens for a reason. I guess it's a wake up call.\"\nMalone said she does not know what sparked the shooting. Investigators are still working to determine the reason behind it, too.\n\"What is it coming to? What is so bad that you're afraid to be in your own home?\" Miller asked. \"I just hope that the young people stop. Stop. There's nothing that bad where you have to shoot up the neighborhood.\"\nPolice say the suspects were seen leaving the scene in a white SUV. No other suspect descriptions are available.\nAll four victims were treated at the hospital and were released.\nIf you have any information about these shootings, contact Crime Stoppers by calling 901-528-CASH (2274), texting 'AWARD' to 274637, or visiting www.528cash.org.\nCopyright 2014 WMC Action News 5.
