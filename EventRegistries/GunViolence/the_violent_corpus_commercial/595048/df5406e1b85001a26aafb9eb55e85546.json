In court documents, police reveal a feud between a group with which Jackson associates and a group associated with two of his alleged victims from Northview Heights.\nPolice write that Jackson's \"conduct could have likely resulted in serious injuries to any of the hundreds of bystanders who fled across Liberty Avenue to escape his gunfire.\"\nMeanwhile, Judge Jeffrey Manning revoked bond on Monday for Denzel Glover, also 16, of Northview Heights, who is charged with the shooting of another teen last Tuesday outside the Wood Street T station.\nAssistant District Attorney Stephie-Anna Ramaley told Manning that Pittsburgh police intelligence revealed Glover is involved in an ongoing feud between two rival groups, one in Pittsburgh Police Zone 1 and the other in Zone 5. She told the court that Glover is a serious danger to the public.\nGlover's defense attorney, Owen Seman, disputed that when he spoke with Pittsburgh's Action News 4 after the court hearing.\n\"There are always conflicts between different neighborhood groups. I don't know of any connection between those neighborhood groups at this point. I mean, everything is speculation right now,\" said Seman, who suggested Glover himself faces danger whether in or out of jail.\nSeman told Manning that Glover is the target of serious threats.\n\"That's the problem with gang violence, everyone is in some danger,\" Manning observed from the bench.\nSeman indicated he will continue to seek Glover's release from jail.\n\"Given his age, (he should be on) electronic monitoring. I mean, you put a 16-year-old kid in jail, you never know what's going to happen,\" Seman told Pittsburgh's Action News 4 reporter Bob Mayo.\nAsked if he's concerned for Glover's safety inside the Allegheny County Jail, Seman answered, \"Absolutely, absolutely.\"\nManning revoked Glover's bond and Glover was taken into custody by sheriff deputies in the courtroom. The judge said if the defense wants to seek Glover's release to electronic home monitoring, it can submit the request to pretrial services for review. The defense would then have to file a new motion making the request to the court.\nIn Jackson's case, police work in tracking down witnesses and security camera video led to his arrest. The criminal complaint details how police talked with witnesses, then compared security camera videos documenting where the suspect entered and left on Port Authority transit.\nThe criminal complaint said a witness confirmed the person in a security camera image was the gunman. When Pittsburgh's Public Safety Bureau released those images to the public on Sept. 1, seeking the identity of a \"person of interest,\" parties came forward identifying the person in the image as Jackson. One was with Allegheny County Juvenile Probation. The other party was anonymous.\nThe detective who filed the criminal complaint against Jackson is assigned to the Pittsburgh Police Group Violence Intervention Unit, which is investigating the circumstances of the shooting that happened downtown as the city's Fourth of July celebration was coming to a close.\n\"Jackson turned himself in at approximately 3 p.m. today at police headquarters,\" said city Public Safety spokeswoman Sonya Toler in an emailed statement.\"\nJackson will be charged as an adult. His charges include two counts of criminal attempted homicide, four counts of aggravated assault, causing a catastrophe, firearms not to be carried without a license, possession of a firearm by a minor, four counts of recklessly endangering another person, and discharging a firearm within the city.\""}
