Jonathan Howard said all the victims in the shootings were shot at night inside or near a car in residential areas. Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the crimes or find any common traits of age, race or gender among the victims, Howard said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking people to be fearful,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI\u2019m asking for them to raise their level of awareness to a healthy level.\u201d\nPolice added the fatal April 19 shooting of 55-year-old Krystal Annette White along a street east of downtown, two aggravated assaults, and one criminal damage incident to the list of those investigators have connected to the same shooter or shooters.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nMute\nCurrent Time 0:00\n/\nDuration Time 0:00\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nStream TypeLIVE\nRemaining Time -0:00\nPlayback Rate\n1\nChapters\nChapters\ndescriptions off, selected\nDescriptions\nsubtitles off, selected\nSubtitles\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\ncaptions off, selected\nCaptions\nFullscreen\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done\nCLOSE\nSkip in Skip\nx\nEmbed\nx\nShare\nThe Phoenix Police Department met with members of the community on Wednesday, July 6, 2016.

Berkeley Rd. home. The night of April 1, the killers gunned down Diego Verdugo-Sanchez in front of a house on W. Turney Ave., investigators said.\nHoracio De Jesus Pena was killed June 3 on W. Flower St., and Manuel Castro Garcia died after he was shot on W. Coronado Rd. a week later, according to police.\nThe nonprofit Silent Witness has offered a $30,000 reward for credible tips in the case. The shootings happened a year after a series of unsolved Phoenix-area highway shootings.\nInvestigators met with Maryvale-area last week to discuss the recent spate of killings, The Arizona Republic reported.\n\u201cI think that our neighbors are really anxious about it and I understand. We have little ones and we\u2019re used to playing in the afternoon and we\u2019re a little nervous right now,\u201d resident Rosa Manjavar told the newspaper. \u201cBut I just hope that if we work together with the police department, if we work as a team, something is going to come up pretty soon.\u201d\nWith News Wire Services."}
