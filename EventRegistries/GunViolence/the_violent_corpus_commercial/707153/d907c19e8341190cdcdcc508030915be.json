He was funny, he was smart, and he was loved.\u201d\nAdkins asked that community members not hold grudges and leave the investigation to law enforcement.\n\u201cWe know that justice is going to succeed in this matter. We\u2019re just not going to put it in our hands, we\u2019re going to let the law put it in their hands,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all have to forgive and let everything take its place.\u201d\nThe family also asked people to refrain from posting negative comments about the suspect or incident on social media.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone posting any type of hatred or revengeful words on Facebook, because James wouldn\u2019t want it. And we don\u2019t want it,\u201d the teen\u2019s aunt said.\nMeans recently had started attending weekly meetings held by the local nonprofit Dreams Community Development Corporation at the West Virginia State Economic Development Center.\nIt was at those meetings, known as Sunday Sit-Down, where director Obi Henderson first got to know Means.\n\u201cIt was only his second time coming to Sunday Sit-Down,\u201d Henderson said. The meetings teach local youths, dubbed \u201cDream Chasers,\u201d about developing their communication skills and \u201csoft skills,\u201d and other career development tools.\n\u201cHe wanted to create an auto-mechanic shop,\u201d Henderson said.\nHe recalled a recent event where Means got to experience an electric car for the first time, then excitedly told his friends how the car worked.\nHis life\u2019s goals were \u201cvery attainable,\u201d he added.\n\u201cJames was a nice, respectable, fun-loving guy,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThe type of kid that didn\u2019t start any trouble, he just wanted to go with the flow of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nAccording to the criminal complaint released by the Charleston Police Department on Tuesday, Means and Pulliam exchanged words after bumping into each other in front of the Dollar General at 1555 Washington Street East on Monday night.\nAfter the argument, Pulliam went into the store while Means joined friends on the porch at the home of one of their grandmothers. When Pulliam left the store, the complaint says he walked past the house where the youths were sitting.\nAs another verbal dispute ensued, Means crossed the street to approach Pulliam, who then allegedly shot Means twice in the abdomen with a .380 caliber revolver.\nWhen former East End resident Douglas Evans saw a GoFundMe account created Tuesday for Means\u2019 funeral expenses, he immediately recognized the teen from an interaction they had last winter.\n\u201cI got my car stuck on one of the snow banks and my wheels were spinning,\u201d Evans said. \u201cJames and three or four of his friends, without being asked, came up, got behind my car and pushed my car out.\u201d\nAs of 5 p.m. Tuesday, the GoFundMe account for Means had already raised more than $2,600.
