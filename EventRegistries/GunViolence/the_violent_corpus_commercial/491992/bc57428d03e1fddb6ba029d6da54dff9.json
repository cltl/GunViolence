I just don't understand why somebody would go in the house and just randomly start shooting with a child in the bedroom with the mother and father.\"\nAnn Sands lives just one door down and is very close with Kerrigan and Monroe.\nShe says the suspect busted in through this window and went on an odd shooting rampage.\n\"She said when the guy busted through the window, he said \u2018I am the reaper.' Then he went upstairs and started shooting,\" said Sands,\nNeighbors say the suspect then fled, but almost immediately returned to the crime scene and sat on the couch until police arrived, they would arrest Melville Mason without incident.\nMason is well known on this block, many say he went by the name PJ and lives on the corner just below Kim Poe.\n\"He was one of these, he was going to rule the block. I mean how can you rule the block. He's only been here three years and I've lived upstairs over ten and I've never had any trouble out of anybody until he moved in,\" said Poe.\nBut why he would shoot and kill this young couple with a 17 month old baby neighbors can only guess.\nThere is some talk about a fight that goes back to last week, but Baltimore police will only rely on their predictable refrain that this was a targeted shooting and not random.\nThat proved out to be the case, but it is of little comfort for those who had to watch the scene unfold.\n\"My best friend is gone, her boyfriend's gone and there is a child without a mother and father. This is sad,\" said Sands.\nThe two others that were shot this morning include Monroe's mother and a family friend.\nAt first, the couple's neighbor Ann Sands was taking care of their baby who again was unharmed; we are told she is now in the care of her other grandmother.\nCopyright 2013 Scripps Media, Inc.
