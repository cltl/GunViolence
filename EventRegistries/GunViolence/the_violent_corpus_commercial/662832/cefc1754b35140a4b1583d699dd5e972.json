Roper in announcing an arrest in the case.\nBell said the death of 4-year-old Rodriquez Ferguson 'makes no sense.'\nJoseph Lewis, 27, was arrested on Tuesday morning.\nBell praised the community for helping police make an arrest while calling on citizens to 'be more cognizant of the way we interact with people.'\n\u201cOur hearts bleed for this child who didn\u2019t have a chance,\u201d Bell said.\n\u201cThis was senseless. Unnecessary,\u201d Councilman Jay Roberson said.\nFerguson died on Saturday after being shot in the head following an argument over a cellphone.\n\u201cShot spotters, policing can only do so much. We really got to get men to start standing up and being men in our communities,\" Roberson said.\nBell called on the community to continue helping police with information about crime. He also encouraged them to do more.\n\u201cHopefully, this will send a strong message to the community to not just help after the fact, but to stop these occurrences before they start,\u201d Bell said.\nCopyright 2016 WBRC.
