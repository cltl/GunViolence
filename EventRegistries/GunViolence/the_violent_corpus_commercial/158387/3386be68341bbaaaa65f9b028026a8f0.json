The confrontation claimed the life of a 20-year-old man who police believe was an innocent bystander.\nA tearful Angelo Mares, who was present when the shooting broke out last night and returned to the scene Sunday, said the victim was a close friend who was killed by a stray bullet. He said his friend, whose name hasn\u2019t been released by authorities, had attended Rosemont High School and recently had started working at Job Corps.\n\u201cHe got caught in the crossfire. He got hit in the back of the head,\u201d Mares said. \u201cWe were both smoking cigarettes. People were just arguing and we were watching them fight, and three or four other guys brought out guns.\u201d\nAcross the street from the strip mall, about 20 people were waiting for crime scene investigators to open the area so they could get to their cars parked in front of half a dozen establishments inside the yellow police tape. Investigators said they found blood splatters from the corner of Fulton and Alta Arden to the middle of the block in front of the the BMW dealership.\nThose involved in the shootout scattered before police arrived, and detectives have not yet determined the motive for the shootout or whether the parties involved were linked to one another, authorities said.\n\u201cA couple of groups of people got into an argument in the strip mall, and several were shot,\u201d Swisher said. \u201cThere were dozens of shots fired.\u201d\nLea Waterman said she and several friends had just arrived at the packed Hookah Lounge to celebrate her 19th birthday when she heard bursts of gunfire. \u201cI just dropped to the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard about 12 shots, and then I stopped counting.\u201d\nAnother person who had been waiting all night to get to her car, Latisha McGhee, 19, said she and her friends arrived at 1:15 a.m. \u201cWhen we got there, there was just a big ol\u2019 fight and they started shooting. I took off running \u2013 I was focused on keeping my life.\u201d\nEli Habibeh, who owns the Blow and Tell smoke shop nearby, said \u201can argument involving kids\u201d ages 19 and up erupted as a crowd gathered in front of the Hookah Lounge and the nearby 1 Stop Liquor and Wine. The business center also includes a pizzeria and a transmission and smog shop.\nHabibeh said the parking lot is a draw for crowds of young people. \u201cToo many people hang out there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople being loud, arguing, all outside the place.\u201d This time, he added, \u201cPeople started shooting,\u201d and the shooting continued at a nearby convenience store. Habibeh, who also had spent the night waiting to get to his car, said he saw police arrest three or four people after the shootout.\nZak Nayagkh, who said his son owns The Hookah Lounge, said the argument started across the street in the parking lot of Target and then moved to the strip mall.\nFulton Avenue was closed for some 200 yards in each direction as detectives processed the crime scene late into the afternoon.\nAnyone having information on the shootout is asked to call the Sheriff\u2019s Department at (916) 874-5115, or (916) 874-8477 to provide information anonymously."}
