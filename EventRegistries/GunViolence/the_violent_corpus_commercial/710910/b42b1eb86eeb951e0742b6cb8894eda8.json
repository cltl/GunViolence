(OPD Press Release) - A teen who died hours after being shot Saturday morning has been identified as 16-year-old Markeise Dunn.\nDunn was shot at North 24th and Pratt streets just after 10:30 a.m. A witness said she heard five gunshots in rapid-fire succession. A possible suspect was last seen in a burgundy car heading westbound on Pinkney Street.\n\"I just thought man, another one.\" For Lee Robinson, it's a story that has become all too common. \"People getting killed every day. It shouldn't be that way, but it is what it is. Like if it's not my family member or loved one, it don't touch my heart that way no more. It's just crazy with all this crime going on that people can't come to the realization and realize that it's not good for the family of the victims.\"\nRobinson says this kind of a tragedy serves as a reminder of how precious life is. \"Ain't no telling what could happen. You don't know when you're next, when your time is coming, so you've got to focus on yourself and what you've got to do.\"\nAnyone with information about the murder is asked to call the OPD Homicide Unit at 402-444-5656 or Crime Stoppers at 402-444-STOP."}
