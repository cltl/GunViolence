When they didn\u2019t get a response, they forced it open.\nInside the apartment they found a woman in her early 40s, stabbed to death. Earlier in the day, Collier County police found the bodies of a juvenile girl, a man and a woman inside a Chevy Malibu on the side of a highway just outside Naples. The three had been shot to death.\nFriday morning, outside the apartment building at 550 NW 51st Ave., police said they suspect the two incidents are connected.\n\u201cAt the current moment, it\u2019s a puzzle we\u2019re putting together,\u201d said Miami Police Sgt. Freddie Cruz.\nA resident at the apartment complex who lived just a few doors down and who wouldn\u2019t give his name, confirmed that police questioned residents there and that the members of the family who were found dead Thursday lived in apartment 38.\nA Miami police source familiar with the investigation said, \u201cIt\u2019s possible it\u2019s tied to Collier County and it\u2019s possible those people and this woman live in the same apartment.\u201d The source also said it\u2019s likely that the woman found dead in the apartment is the mother of the juvenile found shot in Collier County.\nBy mid afternoon Friday police in Miami and in Collier County had still not released the names of four people found dead. Calls to the Collier County Sheriff\u2019s Office had not been returned.\nBut Collier County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Kristi Lester told Miami Herald news partner CBS 4 that the death investigations are related and that police are no longer looking for suspects.\nPolice were first alerted to the tragedy Thursday morning after someone discovered a Chevy Malibu on the side of U.S. 41 in Ochopee, about 36 miles southeast of Naples.\nJames Bronson, 63, told the Naples Daily News that he passed the car about 9:30 a.m., but thought little of it other than it probably broke down. Still, Bronson said he peeked inside the car, saw a woman and believed she was sleeping. When he returned about an hour later and the car was still there, he got more curious and wandered over.\n\u201cI went and knocked on the window and there was no movement,\u201d Bronson was quoted as saying in by the Naples paper. \u201cSo I looked inside and I could see that there was something bad, wrong, you know. I could see blood.\u201d\nBronson called 911. Bronson said Collier County sheriff\u2019s deputies told him they found three people dead inside the Malibu \u2014a woman in the front seat and a juvenile and a man in the back.\nDeputies, either through identification found inside the car or the car\u2019s Miami license plate, were able to tie it to the apartment on Northwest 51st Avenue. So they called Miami police.\n\u201cAll I can say is that this is tragic incident. We\u2019re asking anyone with information that can help us put this puzzle together to please come forward,\u201d said Cruz.\nCharles Rabin: 305-376-3672, @ChuckRabin"}
