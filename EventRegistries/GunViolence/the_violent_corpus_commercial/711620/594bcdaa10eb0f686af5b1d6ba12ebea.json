After an evening of hunting, both men returned to Armstrong\u2019s truck. Armstrong then placed his .223 caliber rifle on the rear floorboard of the quadcab pickup prior to Fischer returning to the truck.\nBut when Fischer went to lay his rifle in the floorboards, officials say Armstrong\u2019s rifle fired, striking Fischer in the left arm. Armstrong and the landowner were able to apply a tourniquet to Fischer\u2019s arm in an attempt to stop the bleeding. He was transported to Hancock Regional Hospital and then airlifted to St. Frances Hospital. He will undergo surgery this evening for his injuries.\nIndiana Conservation Officer Scott Johnson is investigating the shooting."}
