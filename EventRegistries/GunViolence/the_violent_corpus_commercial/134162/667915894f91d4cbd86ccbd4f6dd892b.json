There was about 25-30 shots that rang out, everyone was screaming and yelling and just running all hysterical,\u201d said a witness who did not want to be identified.\nIn all, seven people were shot at Peregrine Park \u2013 on day that was supposed to celebrate a child\u2019s life.\n\u201cThere was one kid shot in the leg, the other guy was shot who died \u2026 and there was a couple people around the corner [with] wounds to the leg and to the back,\u201d the witness said.\nFamily and friends at the party, reeling after the violence, held each other in prayer.\n\u201cSomebody called and said, \u2018Don\u2019t come to this party, they just shot this party up.\u2019 I was like I don\u2019t believe this. What is going on?\u201d said Brenda Jones.\nJones\u2019 2-year-old grandson was at the birthday party.\n\u201cSome lady over there pulled a bunch of kids that were at the party, she grabbed them and pulled them into her house,\u201d Jones said.\nPolice aren\u2019t saying how many suspects there are, or why the gunmen chose to put little kids in the line of fire. But, investigators think it may be gang related.\n\u201cSome folks approached the party, shots were fired,\u201d said Doug Morse with the Sacramento Police Department. \u201cOur gang detectives were called out so we are going to try to get to the bottom of that.\u201d\nThe six others shot during the incident are expected to survive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s devastating that it happened in my backyard and the park that we go to everyday,\u201d a neighbor in the area said.\nSunday, investigators told CBS13 that they believe someone at the party fired back at some point during the shooting.\nAuthorities ask anyone with information about the shooting to call the Sacramento Police Department."}
