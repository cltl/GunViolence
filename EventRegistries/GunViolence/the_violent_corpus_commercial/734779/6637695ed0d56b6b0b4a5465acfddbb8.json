Family members describe this as a Christmas tragedy.\nThe Henderson County Sheriff\u2019s Department says 23-year-old Julius Gray died after he was shot Sunday morning in a mobile home on Middleburg Road.\n\u201cYou kind of hope it\u2019s not him because you didn\u2019t see him, but you know it\u2019s him,\u201d Gray\u2019s sister, Mary Smith Elrod, said.\nDeputies say the person of interest is a 15-year-old juvenile and that the incident happened while both of them were sitting on a couch.\nShe shared how investigators describe her brother\u2019s death.\n\u201cHe was standing there pointing a gun at my brother, and he said \u2018are you scared now,\u2019 and my brother said \u2018no, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not afraid to die,\u2019 and then he pulled the trigger,\u201d Elrod said.\nThe family says Gray was staying at the mobile home and that his daughter is now without a father.\n\u201cHer name is Abrianna, and that was his world,\u201d his aunt Marilyn Cannon said.\nHis sister says she just saw her brother and the 15-year-old together before the holiday.\n\u201cThis boy ate Christmas dinner with my family Friday night,\u201d Elrod said, referring to the teenager.\nNeighbors who didn\u2019t want to go on camera said they believe the shooting was accidental.\nThe family disagrees. \u201cI don\u2019t call pointing a gun in someone\u2019s face and pulling the trigger \u2014 I don\u2019t call that an accident,\u201d Elrod said.\n\u201cWho lets a 15-year-old child have a gun?\u201d Cannon said.\nDeputies say one shot was fired. They have not released a cause due to the open investigation.\n\u201cWe do want justice, but right now we would be appreciative to have some information,\u201d Elrod said.\nThe District Attorney\u2019s Office is reviewing the case. Deputies say charges could come later."}
