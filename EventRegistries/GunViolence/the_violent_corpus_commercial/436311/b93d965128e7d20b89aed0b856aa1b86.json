But if it had not been for Hyco, I believe my family would\u2019ve had to bury me.\u201d\nAnderson County Sheriff John Skipper and at least nine other deputies stood behind Surratt as he testified at the Anderson County Courthouse but did not speak at the hearing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emotional issue,\u201d Skipper said after court. \u201cIt affects us all.\u201d\nHyco was on his way to the vet to get his teeth checked Oct. 21 when Surratt got an emergency call. Soon, their patrol car was turned around, headed toward New Prospect Church Road outside Anderson. Deputies had been a chasing a vehicle, and three men who were allegedly involved in a carjacking. Soon, the three men were involved in a gunfight with Surratt and Deputy Matthew Grant. One of the bullets hit Hyco.\nCraig, 18, is from Seneca and is the youngest person charged in the case. Investigators say he was in the car with Sergio Montez Martin, 23, and David Morris Jr., 22, They are all charged with attempted murder of two deputies and with the killing of Hyco. A Seneca woman, 23-year-old Shirlandria Dixon, is accused of lying about the carjacking. She has been charged with filing a false report.\nCraig\u2019s attorney, Bill Yarborough, described him as a remorseful young man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Yarborough said Craig did not know Hyco had been shot until after he turned himself in to authorities.\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have been where he was,\u201d Yarborough said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d\nHis defense attorney and prosecutors agree that Craig was not the shooter of Hyco, but he is charged with killing him under South Carolina\u2019s \u201chand of one, hand of all\u201d law.\nCraig\u2019s grandmother, Melinda Craig, described him as a respectful teen who helps her with household chores and yard work.\n\u201cI just cannot see him being the hardened criminal he has been made out to be,\u201d she said.\nAssistant Solicitor Rame Campbell did not paint the same picture as Martavious Craig\u2019s grandmother. Campbell said that when deputies searched the car that Craig and his co-defendants had been inside, they found stolen property from Seneca, three guns and three masks.\n\u201cThis was a robbery crew,\u201d Campbell told McIntosh. \u201cI ask that you deny bond based on how violent it got and how quickly it got that violent.\u201d\nMcIntosh denied bail, saying the circumstances of the case and Craig\u2019s juvenile record \u201call point to me that he is a danger to the community.\u201d\nFollow Nikie Mayo on Twitter @NikieMayo"}
