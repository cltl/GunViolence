Calumet Avenue in Lakewood Club.\nPolice initially thought the girl had been struck by a pellet from a shotgun in the house, but later determined the 2-year-old was responsible.\nPolice said the boy managed to remove a .22-caliber rifle from a closet and fire several rounds. One round struck the 4-month-old girl.\nDeputies seized the rifle.\nThe mother of the children was home when the shooting happened, police said.\nMuskegon County Sheriff Dean Roesler said a report will be sent to Muskegon County prosecutors for review.\n\"This incident underscores the dangers of having a loaded weapon in the home that is not secured.
