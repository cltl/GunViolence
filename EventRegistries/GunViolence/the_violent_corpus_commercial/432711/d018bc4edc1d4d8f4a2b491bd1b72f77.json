The weekly party at a playground was interrupted by gunfire.\nIn an area that still bears the scars of Hurricane Katrina, with rebuilt homes mixed with many empty lots, someone opened fire Sunday night at or near a crowded gathering. One neighbor who did not want to be identified heard multiple gunshots.\n\"I'd say at least 10 or 12. They were shooting automatic I know.\"\nIt is unclear if the shooting started at the big, weekly Sunday night party at the playground on Caffin Avenue, or if it started blocks away on Choctaw and Florida, then continued for blocks. New Orleans police are not saying.\nBut four women in their 20s and 30s who were at the big party were hit on the basketball court and each were driven to hospitals in private cars. Police say the bullets did not cause life-threatening wounds.\nStill, neighbors are scared.\n\"'Oh Lord,' I cried at the beginning because I have grandchildren out there playing. I said, 'Hush up. Come inside.' I said, 'Now.' They come on running in I say, 'Stay in,\"' said another resident who did not want to be identified.\nOther neighbors we spoke with were in fear of going on camera at all. Some say the music was so loud they couldn't hear the gunshots and others say that after the gunshots, they saw all the cars in the area screeching away very fast.\n\"It looked like it started down there around the corner, and they come down through there shooting look like they shooting, shooting, shooting, all the way down to the street there,\" said one unidentified person pointing to Choctaw Street toward Florida Avenue.."}
