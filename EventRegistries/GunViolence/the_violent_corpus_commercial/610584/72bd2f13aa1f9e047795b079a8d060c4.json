The second happened in the middle of a busy street\nIn the middle of the afternoon.\nThursday, August 11, officials announced more charges and confirmed the two were connected. Notable among the indictments was no murder indictment against Mondale Goens who was originally charged with the shooting death of his brother at Doubles. But now another man was indicted for the killing. The police chief said there could be even more people charged.\nOf the eight people indicted Michael Tracy Grievous was charged in both shootings. Cornell McKenney was charged in the shooting death at Doubles and Tony Patete, Melinda Gibbey and Zachary Harris were charged in the Central Avenue shooting and were allegedly hired.\nPolice said the shooting on Central Avenue was tied to the Doubles shooting. Cooperation from the public paid off in the first but Chief Bucheit said cooperation had been lacking in the drive by shooting on Central Avenue which claimed two lives.\nOne of the victims was shot at Doubles. The shootings led to tension in the neighborhoods, tension that clergy and neighborhood leaders have been working to diffuse. They have been preaching one message, Pastor Shaq said the work in the neighborhoods will be ongoing and there was no microwave fix.\nThe announcement of the indictments came as Hamilton police have an open house and cook out for the people in the community. Mondale Goens who was originally charged in the killing of his brother was indicted by the grand jury on two counts of felonious assault.\nPolice were still looking for one suspect."}
