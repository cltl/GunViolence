The girl was shot by another 5-year-old while visiting the couple's home last July.\nPolice say the adults were in a different room when the shooting happened. They didn't say how the other child got access to the gun.\nBannock County Prosecutor Steve Herzog says he thinks the gun must have been loaded and in a location where the child could find it. He says such a situation creates unreasonable and foreseeable risks.\nThe Lishes' attorney did not comment on Wednesday. The couple is due back in court May 21.\nAccording to the station, the maximum penalty on the charges includes up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine."}
