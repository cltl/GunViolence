Sprague Ave. On Wednesday police confirmed they arrested a man suspected of shooting Runge.\nRunge\u2019s aunt, Shelley Ethrington, said Runge was born and raised in Spokane and was surrounded by an extended family.\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a beautiful kid,\u201d she said.\nRunge has been in an induced coma since the shooting, but doctors started bringing him out of it Wednesday so they could test his brain function. Ethrington said the bullet is still lodged in her nephew\u2019s brain.\n\u201cThe bullet did some severe damage,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was murdered. Let\u2019s just say it out loud.\u201d\nThe teen had attended North Central High School before dropping out a little more than a year ago but was working on his GED diploma, Ethrington said. He loved to rap and wanted to be a music producer. \u201cHe always told us he was going to be rich and buy us a house up on the hill,\u201d she said.\nA few dozen family and friends turned out for a vigil for Runge Wednesday night, praying and sharing stories about Runge. Many of them centered on the teen\u2019s voracious appetite. The Rev. Jose Ceniceros, a West Central youth pastor, spoke of having Runge over to dinner often and having to fully stock his fridge ahead of time.\n\u201cThis is something none of us expected,\u201d Ceniceros said. \u201cI want this room to be like Dakota, strong and resilient.\u201d\nIn an interview before the vigil, Ceniceros said he\u2019d known Dakota for the last six years and described him as a good kid who had a \u201crough life.\u201d Dakota was homeless and couch surfing with his mother at the time of the shooting, Ceniceros said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first kid I\u2019ve lost,\u201d Ceniceros said. \u201cHonestly it hurts. It really hurts. As a pastor you don\u2019t expect kids to go out like this. Especially this violent. It\u2019s just horrible.\u201d\nDespite Runge\u2019s condition, the family is trying to be hopeful and praying for a miracle, Ethrington said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to believe,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we can do right now.\u201d\nA witness staying in the Bel-Air Motel at the time of the shooting told police that they heard two shots and looked outside so see a car driving away on Sprague and a person lying in the motel\u2019s driveway. The shooting occurred directly across the street from the Hells Angels Club House and may have been captured on their video surveillance cameras, according to court documents. Police have obtained a search warrant to retrieve the video.\nPolice spokesman Officer Shane Phillips said further details on Wednesday\u2019s arrest will be released on Thursday, including the suspect\u2019s name. \u201cIt is still developing,\u201d he said.\nSpokane County Jail records show that Brice W. Bailey, 43, was arrested Wednesday morning on suspicion of attempted first-degree murder. Phillips wouldn\u2019t say if Bailey\u2019s attempted murder charge relates to Runge\u2019s shooting.\nBailey also faces a charge of first-degree assault. The charge comes from shooting at Seventh Avenue and Thierman Road just after 11:40 p.m. Sunday, Phillips said.\nBailey\u2019s previous criminal history includes multiple convictions for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia.\nStaff reporter Eli Francovich contributed to this report."}
