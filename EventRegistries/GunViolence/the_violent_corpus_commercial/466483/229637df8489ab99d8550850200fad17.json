Col. Steve Meinberg said the boy shot himself about 3 p.m. in the 5400 block of Lakewood Terrace in Imperial. The boy\u2019s mother, grandfather and younger sister were home at the time.\nThe adults thought the boy had gone to sleep in his room when they heard a gunshot. Investigators believe the child was wandering around the home when he found the gun in the bathroom, took it into a bedroom and began playing with it.\nThe bullet entered his groin and exited his buttocks, just missing his genitals, Meinberg said. The family drove the child to St. Anthony\u2019s Medical Center for treatment. The child was then transferred to St. Louis Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\u201cThe last I heard, he was talking and laughing with the doctors and asking for a soda,\u201d Meinberg said.\nThe handgun was owned by the boy\u2019s grandfather, who may face charges in the incident, Meinberg said. No arrests had been made Tuesday, but deputies were still investigating."}
