The Texas Rangers were called to investigate after a 19-year-old woman was found dead Monday in a home along U.S. Highway 290 near Ledbetter in Fayette County. A 19-month-old child was rushed to Dell Children\u2019s Medical Center in Austin for treatment of a head wound.\nDeputies say they got a 911 call Monday saying a woman and child were lying in blood on the floor of a home. Deputies identified the woman as Justice Martinez. They believe she died as the result of a gunshot wound.\nFayette County Deputies say they then identified a person of interest who lived in Austin and notified police. Officers went to the man\u2019s address, where he refused to come out. A SWAT team was called in to negotiate, but police say he killed himself instead.
