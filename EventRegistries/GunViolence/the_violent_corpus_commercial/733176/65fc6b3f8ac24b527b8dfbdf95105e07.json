(WNCN) \u2014 A Christmas Eve shooting at a Wilson County home left four people dead.\nThe incident was reported just before 1 p.m. Saturday in the 2200 block of Banks Lane East, which is off N.C. 42 just east of Wilson. All four victims lived at the home and have been identified as Tammy Lynette Pearce, 54, Paul Shane Pearce, 28, Selby Gene Outland, 47, and Dominique Nicole Privette, 23.\nOfficials did not release any other information.\nPeople living in the neighborhood had many questions as they tried to wrap their minds around what happened.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas Eve. It\u2019s shocking,\u201d said a woman named Brenda, who did not want to give her last name. She said her mom, who just recently moved onto Banks Lane, knew one of the victims and is concerned. \u201cIt upsets her anytime something happens to somebody even if she doesn\u2019t really know them. She knew one of them too. He worked in the house for the landlady.\u201d\nNeighbors described the area as quiet.\n\u201cWhat could\u2019ve happened,\u201d asked Michael Taylor, who lives in the area. \u201cWhat could\u2019ve made a person be so crazy to do some things like that? This is a good area. A very good area. Quiet. You don\u2019t hear any bad things going on.\u201d\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
