Yarmouth Police said her injuries were very significant, but that she is expected to survive.\nOfficers discovered that the child had found a fully loaded handgun on a nightstand in the bedroom she shares with her parents.\nThey also said the suspect, Nicholas Jenner, 30, is a military veteran who recently moved his family in with his parents temporarily.\n\u201cThe father left his weapons unsecured,\u201d said Deputy Chief Steven Xiarhos. \u201cOne of them was a handgun on a nightstand, and this tragedy happened.\u201d\nXiarhos said that several unlicensed weapons, including a rifle and a shotgun, were recovered in the home. They seized those guns, as well as the .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol the girl apparently shot herself with.\nInvestigators said Jenner told them the weapons were legal in the state where he previously lived\u2013but police say that\u2019s no excuse.\n\u201cHe is going to be charged with several misdemeanors and felonies,\u201d said Xiarhos.\nBut Jenner was not arrested.\n\u201cWe chose to not arrest him,\u201d Xiarhos said. \u201cWe knew that the weapons were all taken from the home. We know that the girl has been placed in the custody of the Department of Children and Families. So there\u2019s really no danger factor. It\u2019s also Christmastime, and he was very cooperative.\u201d\nJenner is charged with improper storage of a large capacity of a firearm near a minor, unlawful possession of a firearm, and reckless endangerment of a child, and will be summonsed to court at a later date."}
