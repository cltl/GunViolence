(WVEC) -- A hearing for three men charged in the death of a baby during an attempted robbery/home invasion in Portsmouth was delayed until September 25.\nPolice say Marquis Hinton, Jerry Atkinson and Anthony Holley shot 1-year-old Dion Loften Jr. in the head in the Maple Avenue home in June.\nHinton, 18, turned himself in. Two other 18-year-olds -- Anthony Holley and Jerry Atkinson -- were arrested soon after.\nAround 9:30 p.m. on June 27, a man knocked on the door of a duplex on Maple Avenue. He told the woman who answered he wanted to buy some marijuana before two other men, armed with guns, rushed in and demanded money, according to a court document obtained by 13News Now.\nThe woman ran to the back bedroom where others were watching TV and shut the door. The intruders began firing toward the room and a bullet hit the baby as he laid in bed, the document said.\nDion died at the hospital nearly an hour later. Sarah Sutton, 25, was also shot in the back, but is expected to recover.\nPortsmouth Police Chief Ed Hargis credited detailed witness accounts and speedy detective work in the arrests of Atkinson Jr Holley.\n\"There's no reason for it, a one year old never did anything to anybody and to suffer a tragic loss like that, it impacts not only the family, but the entire city,\" said Chief Hargis.\n\"You took an innocent little child from here. He was only one and a half he would've been two December the 18th and you took his whole life,\" Tonia Hayes, Dion's grandmother, said of the suspects. \"I never got to see him grow up.\""}
