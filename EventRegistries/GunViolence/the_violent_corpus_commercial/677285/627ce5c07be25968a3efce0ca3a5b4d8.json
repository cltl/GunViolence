Other bullets were found lodged in the side of their home or on the property.\nJohnson County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigators found that the target Lawlis was shooting at did not have a backstop, and the direction he was shooting went straight toward the Destrampe home, the report said.\nLawlis was surprised when he realized the line of shooting went toward the neighbor\u2019s home, and told the investigator that he thought he was shooting across a field, and he didn\u2019t think the rounds would travel as far as they did, the probable cause affidavit said.\nHe apologized to the sheriff\u2019s office and wrote the Destrampes a letter apologizing as well.\nJohnson County Prosecutor Brad Cooper charged Lawlis with the misdemeanor after reviewing the investigation. The misdemeanor charge applies to a suspect who recklessly, knowingly or intentionally performs an act that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person, according to state law. If convicted, Lawlis could face up to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine."}
