FOX10 News was told the victims all have non-life threatening injuries.\nThe victims are four adults and one juvenile, according to Mobile Police Public Affairs Officer Terence Perkins.\nThe shooting was caught on video as local rap musician C-Nile Afari was doing a Facebook Live stream during a block party. In the final seconds of his video, multiple shots could be heard as well as people screaming. The video becomes erratic as people are running, apparently including the rapper.\nIn a subsequent Facebook video, C-Nile Afari notes that it was \"the first time somebody got shot at one of my parties.\"\n\"It don't even make no sense,\" he says in the video. \"Can't even have fun, man, just chillin'. Just chillin' and enjoying your people. ... This is probably gonna be my last time throwing one of these.\"\nThe rapper notes also that police officers were already present before the shooting began.\nFOX10 News will continue to follow this developing story.\nAll content \u00a9 2016, WALA; Mobile, AL.
