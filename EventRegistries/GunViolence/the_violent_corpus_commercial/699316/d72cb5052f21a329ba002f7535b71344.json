Phillips Hospital, McCullough said.\nMcCullough also said that a 21-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man drove themselves to Orlando Regional Medical Center.\nTroopers said they don't have witnesses and they haven't been able to talk to the victim because doctors have been working to save her.\nA second woman was reportedly hit by the vehicle as well. She suffered minor injuries, and troopers said she was not able to tell troopers very much.\nTroopers weren't able to obtain a description of the vehicle.\nThe shooting victims are expected to survive.\nTroopers said that on Wednesday, they will visit the woman seriously injured in the hit-and-run.\n\u00a9 2017 Cox Media Group."}
