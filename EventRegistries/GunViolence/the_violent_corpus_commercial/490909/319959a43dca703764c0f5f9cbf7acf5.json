Carrollton Ave. He is charged with attempted murder and other charges for each of the four victims.\nDuring a July 16 news conference, Baltimore City Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told reporters that police were assisted by \u201ctips and people in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\u201cFour people were shot on this block,\u201d Batts said at the news conference, which was held at the scene of the violence. \u201cLamont tried to take the lives of citizens on our block.\u201d\nThe brazen daytime shooting shook local residents. According to police, bullets flew at about 2:45 p.m. on an afternoon when many local residents were sitting on their stoops and children were playing outside.\nWhen police arrived on the scene, they found two men lying on a stoop, another in the middle of the street and a fourth lying on his own front porch. Each had been shot, police said.\nAccording to witnesses, the man in the street had been gunned down as he attempted to run away. None of the victims have been identified by police.\n\u201cAll the dudes that got shot were my buddies,\u201d said Keith Gillman, who lives on the block. \u201cI heard gunshots and saw my dude \u2018Pop\u2019 laying on his step\u2026and my other two buddies \u2018Lil\u2019 Troy\u2019 and \u2018Homicide,\u2019 who ran in the 700 block and then fell to the ground.\u201d\nGillman told the AFRO the man he identified only as \u2018Pop\u2019 was shot in the leg. Gillman said he stayed with him until the police arrived. \u201cI just held him down,\u201d he said.\nBatts said the shooting is indicative of the violence sweeping the western district of the city.\n\u201cThis neighborhood is on fire,\u201d Batts said. \u201cI\u2019ve been out here a lot and talking to the neighborhoods. The neighbors provided a tremendous amount of data for us to follow up on. Half way through the year and the city has been faced with multiple shootings in areas of concern.\u201d\nBatts said local residents are frustrated that people are being killed in their neighborhoods.\n\u201cThey are\u2026concerned that people are terrorizing their neighborhoods,\u201d he said.\nOn the day of the shooting, resident Yvette Sarabia, who moved to the neighborhood three months ago, told the AFRO she doesn\u2019t feel safe.\n\u201cI have four kids and I don\u2019t allow them to go outside,\u201d she said.\nAs of July 15, 126 people had been murdered in Baltimore this year, compared to 111 at the same time last year. During the same period this year, the city tallied 219 people shot, compared to 192 in 2012, according to police.\nBatts told reporters that police recently received tips that the Black Guerilla Family is trying to move into Harlem Park.\n\u201cI will be out here and we will root out the problems that are impacting the young kids and their safety in their neighborhoods,\u201d Batts pledged."}
