It was crazy.\"\nCaptain Rob Dance of Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department told WBTV that precautions were taken at a nearby place of learning.\n\"A possible suspect left the scene and was seen in close proximity to Hidden Valley Elementary School, and as a precaution as something we always do. We contacted the school and asked the school to go on lock down, Dance said.\"\nReagan Drive which runs parallel to I-85 was shut down for several hours.\nPolice spent much of the afternoon processing the four door Mazda.\nIt happened in the middle of day...just an hour past the noon lunch hour, and that adds to frustration of so many here who deal with the issue of bullets flying in broad daylight.\n\"My little brother is like seven, and he was riding around when it was happening,\" Mayo said.\nCopyright 2013 WBTV.
