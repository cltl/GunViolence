And they put yellow tape around and I knew he was dead,\" neighbor Anita Fritz said.\nClermont County sheriff's deputies said the shop\u2019s owner, James Baker, 64, was killed by a weapon he showed others how to use safely.\nInvestigators said Baker was shot in the neck while sitting in a nearby room as someone taking a CCW class practiced weapon malfunction drills.\nAttempts were made to revive Baker, but he was pronounced dead at 3:12 p.m. at the shop.\nFritz said she is heartbroken.\n\"An accident like that, it's not, it's bad, just terrible for the family, so I feel very bad for them,\" she said.\nPeople who knew him called him Jim, a neighbor who went the extra mile to lend a hand and keep people safe.\n\"Sheriff's and the cops come in and out all the time cause they loved him, you know, everybody did. All the neighbors did. So it's a tragic thing that happened,\" Fritz said.\nBaker's gun shop offers a long list of training courses to teach people to use guns like rifles and pistols the correct way.\nNow, many in this tight-knit community say they are devastated knowing he won't be here to do that anymore.\n\"He's just a great guy, I mean, I can't believe it happened, it's hard to believe, just a really good guy,\" Fritz said. \"I'm going to miss him because he was a good neighbor.\"\nWe also talked with a man who lives just a few houses down from where it happened.\nHe told us Baker gave him his very first job, calling him a great boss and friend.\nInvestigators aren't saying what type of gun was used or if any charges will be filed."}
