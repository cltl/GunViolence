Officials say guns and ammunition were found inside his Mohawk apartment after emergency crews were sent to a fire there Wednesday morning.\nSoon after, two people were fatally shot and two others wounded at John's Barber Shop, around the corner from the apartment, police said. The second shooting happened about a mile away in Herkimer, where two people were killed at Gaffey's Fast Lube and Car Wash, authorities said.\nThe two villages are about 65 miles east of Syracuse, on opposite sides of the Mohawk River in a region known as the Mohawk Valley.\nOfficials said Meyers remained at large Wednesday afternoon.\nLate Wednesday morning, police SWAT teams and a helicopter converged on a jewelry store in Herkimer.\nThe Utica Observer-Dispatch reported that police were focusing on Freddy's Jewelers on Main Street, near the car wash and oil change business.

Other reports suggested he may have been picked up by a taxi.\nHerkimer County Community College and local schools are on lockdown. The college sent an automated cellphone alert around 10:40 a.m., telling students and staff that there was an \"active shooter\" in the area. The message identified the gunman as a man in his 60s, with a white beard and driving a red Jeep Cherokee. A text alert a few minutes later said the campus was on lockdown. Another alert advised people to remain inside buildings until further notice.\nAmanda Viscomi, Herkimer's acting clerk-treasurer for the village of 7,700, told The Associated Press the shooting at Gaffey's happened a few blocks from village hall. She said she was told the shooter was at large and that state police, sheriff's deputies and other police were swarming the area.\n\"Everybody's on lockdown, all the schools, the college, the village,\" Viscomi said. \"It's very, very scary.\"\nGov. Andrew Cuomo and the head of the state police are on their way to the area and are expected to brief the media later in the day.\nHerkimer is named for the German immigrant family that settled in the western Mohawk Valley in the 1720s. The economically distressed villages are two miles away from Ilion, where a 2-century-old Remington Arms gun plant is a major employer.\nMore on Crimesider\nMarch 13, 2013 - Upstate New York Shooting Update: Police may have located gunman in attack that left 4 dead, 2 woundedMarch 13, 2013 - Upstate New York shooting leaves 4 dead, 2 injured, police tell local media"}
