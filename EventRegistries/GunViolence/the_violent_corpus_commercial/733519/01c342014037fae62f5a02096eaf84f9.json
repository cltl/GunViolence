Marcus Hines said the shooting happened just after 7 p.m. Saturday at a residence in the 5800 block Attaway Street.\nInitially, police were advised the victim was shot when armed men broke into the house, but later learned several males inside the residence were playing with the gun when it discharged, hitting the victim, who was transported to University Health with life-threatening injuries.\nInvestigators immediately initiated an inquiry and learned the shooting was not the result of a home invasion robbery. Following the shooting, Thigpen allegedly hid the gun in a nearby field where police later found it and seized it as evidence.\nThigpen, of the 1900 block of Hickory Street in Shreveport, was subsequently booked into the Shreveport City Jail on a single count of illegal use of a weapon."}
