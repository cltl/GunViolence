His grandmother initially thought the blood on his shoulder was caused by a stray firework, but then saw the bullet.\n\"It hurt a lot,\" Leyton said.\nThe boy's grandparents rushed him to the hospital where the child was treated and released Saturday night.\nPolice believe it was someone within five miles of the driveway who fired the gun into the air.\n\"He was just out here playing in the driveway here and all of a sudden he just started screaming and he ran in the house,\" Leyton's grandfather Jim Riddle said.\n\"The saddest part of everything is he asked me if he was going to go to heaven, and that is what pretty much did it for me,\" Leyton's mother, Trish Riddle, said.\nIn the police report, Council Bluffs authorities said it was a .223-caliber bullet, which had been fired into the air.\n\"I mean, I'm lost in words,\" Trish Riddle said. \"I just can't believe that people would do that. People need to be more aware of that and more safe, especially during the holidays.\"\nPolice are still asking for help identifying whoever fired that shot into the air. Anyone with information is encouraged to call Council Bluffs Crime Stoppers at 712-328-STOP."}
