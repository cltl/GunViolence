He was rushed to Riley Hospital for Children in critical condition, where he died from his injuries. Johnson was a freshman at Franklin Central High School, the school confirmed Monday:\nOur entire teaching staff met before school started this morning to inform everyone and to share a moment of silence. We have our counselors going to each of Rashun\u2019s classes to meet with students and help them through the grieving process. We have counselors from not only Franklin Central but also from the other Franklin Township schools available for any student, teacher or staff member who is struggling. We will continue to have counseling service available for as long as needed.\nDetectives believe the alleged suspect was lured to the location of the shooting using an app. Johnson allegedly pulled out a gun and threatened the suspect. The people at the scene of the shooting started to search the suspect, at which point the suspect allegedly fired shots. The suspect then left the location and called police.\nNeighbors tell FOX 59 News it is not uncommon to hear fighting and even gun shots coming from the home. A nearby neighbor shared cellphone video with us that she says she took on Friday. The video shows a group of teens in the backyard shooting guns. Police were called, like they have been before.\nThe owner of the home, where the deadly shooting happened, did not want to comment. Neighbors say more supervision is needed before another teen is killed.\n\"If there were that many kids there around the ages of 15 and 16, where were their parents at 7:30 a.m. on a Sunday morning,\" said a neighbor.\nThe suspect was interviewed and then released. The Marion County Prosecutor's Office will review the case and determine whether or not to file charges against the suspect after the investigation is completed.\nAnyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana at (317)262-TIPS(8477)."}
