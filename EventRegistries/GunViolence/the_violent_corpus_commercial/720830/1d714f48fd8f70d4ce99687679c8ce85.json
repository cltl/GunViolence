And it\u2019s difficult because of her age. The last thing the state wants to do is file a motion like this, but in this we had no choice after we looked it up,\u201d said Lucas County Juvenile Prosecutor Lori Olander.\nThe teen already has a criminal past, and prosecutors say they will consider her record when making their decision."}
