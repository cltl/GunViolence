And the stepfather reported that immediately upon hanging up with the stepson, just seconds later, he heard a shot. It came from the blind where the young victim was.\u201d\nAfter getting no response to a text asking about the shot, the Weikel\u2019s stepfather, who was approximately 300 yards away, went over to the stand and found the teen crumpled up in the corner, his feet tangled up in a chair, according to Wise County Sheriff Lane Akin.\n\u201cThere may have been some hunter inexperience involved,\u201d Nixon said.\nAkin said the gun is believed to have gone off when he leaned over the rifle, which had a round chambered and the safety off, and all indications point to an accidental shooting.\nNixon said it appears that when Weikel went to stand up and move out of the blind, he reached for the grip of the rifle and squeezed the trigger as he moved, shooting himself with a .243 round.\n\u201cIt was instantly fatal,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real tragedy.\u201d\nWeikel had completed a gun safety course five days earlier and was licensed to hunt, according to law enforcement officials.\nThe teen\u2019s body has been sent to Dallas for autopsy and the Remington 789 sent to a firearms examiner, according to Akin, who said the local Texas Ranger is also assisting in the investigation.\nA funeral service for Weikel will be held at 11 a.m. Saturday at New River Fellowship Church in Hudson Oaks. Visitation has been scheduled for 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Friday at Greenwood Funeral Home on White Settlement Road in Fort Worth."}
