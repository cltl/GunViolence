Weikel was a senior at Weatherford High School, and was on spring break this week.\nWeikel\u2019s stepfather had shot a hog and called Weikel on a cell phone. The stepfather told authorities he heard a gunshot \u201cimmediately\u201d after that phone call.\n\u201cAs he reached down, he grabbed the grip near the trigger,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cAs he was transitioning to get up and exit the blind, the gun discharged.\u201d\nThe gun was a Remington .243 rifle, Nixon said.\n\u201c[The shot] was pretty point blank,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cA young hunter \u2014 a relatively new hunter\u2014 killed this way is everybody\u2019s worst nightmare. It\u2019s hard for a young hunter who\u2019s naturally looking to shoot to remember some basic skills sometimes on maneuvering around the blind.\u201d\nWeikel played defensive end for the Weatherford High School football team, his coach, Weldon Nelms, said.\n\u201cHe wasn't very big, but he was just tough-minded and a hard worker,\u201d Nelms said Tuesday. \u201cA coach is always supposed to go before his kids, and that\u2019s the kind of a tough thing I\u2019ve had to face in 37 years of coaching.\u201d\nLast summer, a 9-year-old boy was fatally shot by his grandfather in a hunting accident east of Decatur.\nIn 2013, Denton Guyer football player Nate Maki was accidentally shot to death by his best friend while hunting coyotes on a ranch near Bowie. The friend, Michael Bryce Underwood, received five years\u2019 probation after pleading guilty to criminally negligent homicide.\nStaff writer Lance Winter contributed to this report\nRyan Osborne: 817-390-7684, @RyanOsborneFWST"}
