(WZZM) \u2013 His grandfather says it was 100% \"an accident.\"\nDaniel Hummel says his 12-year-old grandson didn't mean to shoot and kill a family friend sleeping in the next room of their Kalamazoo home.\n\"He didn't mean to shoot it,\" says Hummel. \"He accidentally hit the trigger and the gun went off.\"\nDaniel Hummel says his grandson is mentally impaired, but managed to find the key to the gun-safe, unlock it, and load a shotgun.\n\"He said he was trying to find change in my pockets and he found the key to the gun safe,\" Hummel explains. \"He unlocked it and he got a gun out and he put a bullet in it.\"\nThen when he was trying to unload the gun and put it back, he accidentally pulled the trigger. Birdshot went through a closet wall into the living room and killed 28-year-old Deb Christner.\n\"She was watching TV and fell asleep sitting in a chair,\" he says. \"It wasn't deliberate. He said he didn't mean to shoot the gun. He was just trying to get the bullet back out of it so he could put it back.\"\nHummel says the 12-year-old is being evaluated by his mental health counselor to determine what should happen next with the boy,\n\"Even locking guns up to keep them away from children sometimes isn't enough,\" he says with a sigh. \"You put the key somewhere they can't get it, and somehow they seem to find it. You never know what a child is going to do.\""}
