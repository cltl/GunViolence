It occurred on land leased for hunting, AJC writes.\nAs darkness fell around the hunting party, Scott said he felt limited in time to take a shot, AJC.com notes, and never thought that what he did fire at could be a person.\nTaylor said these sorts of accidents occur far too frequently.\nThe autopsy showed a gunshot wound to the head, coroner William Holcombe confirmed.\nThe South Carolina Department of Natural Resources is investigating the matter."}
