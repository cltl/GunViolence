She had just returned home with her mother and two siblings when she picked up the weapon that was unlocked and in plain sight, along with two rifles and another handgun.\n\"It makes me angry,\" Sheriff Tony Mancuso told KPLC-TV. \"It makes my heart hurt. It's just something that shouldn't happen.\"\nThe girl's father had been cleaning his guns while his wife and three children were out, the sheriff said.\nFor some reason, the man failed to put way the weapons, leaving them in the living room, out in the open. Then he went to work.\nWhen the mother came home with her 1-year-old, 2-year-old and Alexis, the eldest child managed to grab one of the handguns and fire it.\n\"This is a moment as a sheriff that I have to tell people, 'You have got to protect our children,''' Mancuso said.\nEvery gun sold in the state comes with a lock, the sheriff said. People should use them.\nThe solution, he said, couldn't be simpler. Lock your guns. Or put them in a lock box.\nThe local prosecutor's office is investigating the shooting death.\nON A MOBILE DEVICE? SEE THE VIDEO HERE."}
