However, when they arrived on the scene, it was determined that the child had been shot in the head with a .22 caliber magnum revolver.\nThe child was flown from the scene to Children's Mercy Hospital, where he later died.\nWhite said the younger child was in a playpen, and the older one found a loaded handgun lying around the bed.\nFor neighbors, especially those with small children, this is a wakeup call.\n\"You know, just some gun safety could have cone into play and would have maybe, you know, prevented the situation, but it's just really sad altogether,\" neighbor Jessica Hutchison said.\nDeputies say no foul play is suspected and that the shooting was accidental.\nThe sheriff's office says the gun actually belonged to another family member, not the mother. They're investigating that aspect of the case now.\nIn the meantime, the other three children are in the custody of relatives.\nFriends have set up a GoFundMe page to help the family. So far, it has raised more than $17,000. Click here to donate.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) All rights reserved."}
