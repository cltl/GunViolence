He called Corbin's Jan. 19 death \"tragic\" and \"accidental.\"\nThe shooting happened as the boy and his siblings were visiting the grandfather's home in the town of Elmo, which is located 120 miles north of Kansas City, Missouri. Rice said the mother knew her father had multiple guns. But Rice said Corbin's mother and grandfather believed the firearms were locked up in a gun safe and weren't loaded.\nRice said the 5-year-old found a .22-caliber handgun in the headboard of the grandfather's bed."}
