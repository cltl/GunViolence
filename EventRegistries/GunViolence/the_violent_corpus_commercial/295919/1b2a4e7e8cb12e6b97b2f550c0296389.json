Officers were seen escorting Reyes from the home to a waiting police wagon just after 4 p.m., and he was booked into the Lucas County jail about 7:30 p.m.\nRecords show Reyes and his girlfriend, Solana Mendoza, 24, each were convicted of aggravated assault in Lucas County Common Pleas Court in 2009. The conviction meant they were prohibited from owning, possessing, or using a firearm.\nReyes was placed on community control for three years and ordered to spend 90 days at the Corrections Center of Northwest Ohio and 60 days in the Lucas County Work Release Program.\nIn a motion asking the court to modify his work release sentence to house arrest, Reyes\u2019 attorney wrote that Reyes was \u201clegally blind and disabled from any type of employment because he has profound loss of vision from a childhood illness at the age of three.\u201d Reyes had childhood retinitis, the motion stated.\nYoung Kaylee\u2019s shooting was the second such incident this month.\nOn Feb. 6, Marquise Hudson, Jr., 2, was shot in an apparent gang-related drive-by at a home in the 200 block of Maumee Avenue not far from the scene of Saturday\u2019s incident. The shot that struck the 2-year-old shattered a glass front door, passed through the youngster\u2019s arm and lodged in his stomach. No arrests have been made.\nAccording to the 2014 report, \u201cInnocents Lost: A Year of Unintentional Deaths,\u201d at least 100 children were killed in unintentional shootings in the United States between December, 2012, and December, 2013. Some 65 percent of those incidents occurred in a home or vehicle that belonged to the victim\u2019s family, while 19 percent took place in the home of a relative or friend of the victim.\n\u201cOf the child shooting deaths in which there was sufficient information available to make the determination, 70 percent could have been prevented if the firearm had been stored locked and unloaded,\u201d stated the report by Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. \u201cBy contrast, incidents in which an authorized user mishandled a gun \u2014 such as target practice or hunting accidents \u2014 constituted less than 30 percent of the incidents.\u201d\nContact Jennifer Feehan at: jfeehan@theblade.com or 419-213-2134."}
