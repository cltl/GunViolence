Police feared an artery had been pierced, and an officer applied a tourniquet to the teen's leg to stem the bleeding.\nThe youth was taken to St. John Medical Center in serious condition.\nIn a news release, police said the \"quick action\" of the officer who applied the tourniquet prevented the boy from bleeding to death.\nThe incident was the second time the teen had accidentally shot himself with a handgun, police said. Officers went to his residence about three months ago and found him with a gunshot wound to the leg. That injury was not life-threatening.\nA police spokesman did not know where the victim obtained the guns but said the gun used in the first accident had been confiscated and remained at a police station."}
