Both are charged with murder in the death of Moises Jimenez. A third person is still being questioned.\nHomicide Sgt. Steven Murdock said the pair killed the 6-year-old boy and wounded his 11-year-old brother in a Sept. 25 drive-by shooting as part of a feud with the boys' teenage brothers. Murdock also said the shootings may be gang-related.\nInvestigators have said the two brothers were asleep when someone inside a vehicle opened fire into the residence, then drove away. The younger sibling was dead at the scene.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."}
