Sansom , a spokesperson with the department, in a statement.\nSansom said officers exited the building to find a truck parked the wrong way at the entrance of the parking lot. A toddler was found inside the truck, which was left running with the driver side door open.\nOfficers continued to search the area and found 25-year-old Elroy Caleb Middleton at the adjacent fire department with an injured child.\n\"The infant was the victim of an apparent single gunshot wound to the left upper neck,\" Sansom said. \"The male parent was hysterical and the infant was crying but alert and responsive.\"\nThe 1-year-old girl was transported by air ambulance to a Dallas hospital. Authorities haven't released her condition.\n\"The police are investigating the cause of the incident, but preliminary reports indicate the children were left in the running vehicle at Southwestern Christian College campus while the father ... conducted some business just feet away from the vehicle,\" Sansom said. \"A shot was heard and it was clear the infant was injured.\"\nPolice say a 9mm handgun was found inside the vehicle, which had an exit hole in the right rear passenger door.\nSansom said the father initially told police he was \"with security\" at Southwestern Christian College, but it was later determined Middleton isn't a state licensed security officer. Police say Middleton is also not licensed to carry.\n\"It is not a violation of state law to posses a firearm in a vehicle in Texas,\" Sansom said. \"However, it is a violation to make a weapon accessible to a minor.\"\nAn investigation into the shooting is underway.\nCopyright 2016 WFAA"}
