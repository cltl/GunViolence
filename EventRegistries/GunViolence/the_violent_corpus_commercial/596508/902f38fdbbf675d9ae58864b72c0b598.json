Robert John.\nThe shooting occurred about 4:45 a.m. at Sunderland Road at Vista Avenue near Blanding Boulevard about the same time neighbors said they heard a woman screaming.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the process of trying to find out what happened,\u201d John said.\nHis mother, Erica Carter, expressed her grief on Facebook.\n\u201cToday my world has been shattered,\u201d her post reads. \u201cMy oldest son Johnnie Carter, was shot and killed this morning. I woke up to the cops telling me my son was dead. As much as I appreciate everyone\u2019s concern, I am not capable right now of seeing or talking to anyone. Please give me time, and space.\u201d\nFriends of Carter told Times-Union news partner First Coast News they were hanging out at a house and driving around.\nOne friend said Carter was dropped off at 4 a.m. A short time later officers found him shot to death in the road just a couple blocks from his home.\nCarter\u2019s aunt, Sharon Quigley, said he snuck out of the house but his mom was home when he returned. Then he left again, Quigley told First Coast News.\n\u201cShe was asleep,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cThe next thing she knew, the cops were knocking at the door and he was down there. That\u2019s how she found out.
