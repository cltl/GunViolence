Authorities told WVTM13 News the shooting took place inside a bedroom in the house.\nPolice said the siblings were playing in their great-grandparents' bedroom when they found a gun on the nightstand. The 3-year-old grabbed the gun and shot his 9-year-old sister in the head.\n\"It looks like a tragic accident,\" said Irondale Police Chief Ken Atkinson. \"The great-grandmother was not aware that the pistol was laying on the nightstand.\"\nThe child was airlifted to Children's of Alabama with life-threatening injuries. She died later Saturday afternoon at the hospital.\n\"We're just depending on God, you know? You just have to give it to Him; that's all we can do,\" said Donahoo.\nPolice are calling the shooting tragic and believe it is accidental, but it remains under investigation.\nFamily members said Kimi loved to spend time at her great-grandparents' house. Her uncle said even though she's not with them any longer, they know where she is.\n\"Kim just accepted the Lord nine months ago so we know she's in Heaven,\" said Donahoo."}
