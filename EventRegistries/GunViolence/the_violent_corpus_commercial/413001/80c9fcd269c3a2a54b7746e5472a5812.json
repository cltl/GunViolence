Photos courtesy of MCSO\nMarion County sheriff's detectives on Monday arrested two more men in the Sept. 13 shooting outside Cloud 9 that resulted in the death of 19-year-old Benetria Robinson and injuries to five other people.\nMarion County sheriff's detectives on Monday arrested two more men in the Sept. 13 shooting outside Cloud 9 that resulted in the death of 19-year-old Benetria Robinson and injuries to five other people.\nGary Edward King, 20, and Michael Eugene Smith, 20, both of Ocala, face one count of second-degree homicide with a firearm and five counts of attempted second-degree homicide with a firearm, according to arrest reports.\nLaquan Ria'Mel Barrow, 24, of Ocala, who was arrested previously in the case, is now also being held without bail on the same charges at the Marion County Jail.\nBased on numerous witness accounts, sheriff's detectives believe all three fired into the overflow crowd outside the nightclub at 1910 S. Pine Ave. in Ocala early that Sunday morning.\nOcala police officers working a traffic stop several hundred feet away recorded the sounds of the shots on their body cameras. Twenty-one shots were heard within about five seconds. Twenty-one shells casings were recovered at the scene.\nRobinson, a Forest High School graduate and athlete at Palm Beach State College in Lake Worth, died at the scene with one gunshot wound in the head and another in the shoulder, the reports state.\nNathaniel Kendrick, 35, remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition with a gunshot wound in the chest. The other four victims have been released from the hospital. According to Sheriff's Office reports, they are:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Danielle \"Dee Dee\" Kendrick, 28, who was shot in the back;\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Dontarious Bartley, 19, who was shot in the back;\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Thomia Wadley, 21, who shot in the leg; and\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Danvinist Blunt, 22, who was shot in the leg.\nThey were part of the crowd outside the nightclub.\nAccording to the arrest reports, several witnesses - including a bouncer, patrons and two of the surviving victims - identified the shooters and told the story of that night from their perspectives.\nTogether they gave the following account:\nTwo women were fighting inside the club - including Danielle Kendrick - and Barrow became involved in the fight. They were ejected from the club and the fight continued outside.\nWitnesses reported seeing Barrow and King together and Smith alongside King.\nOne witness reported seeing Barrow and King come out of the club and go to a pickup truck, where each got something out of it and put it in their pockets. Then they came back to the front of the club and Barrow began yelling.\nWitnesses said Smith and King had handguns with extended magazines.\nBarrow told the crowd outside, \"Y'all better move,\" several times. Smith also seemed to know what was coming, telling one witness, \"Hey, bro, better move.\"\nThe women were fighting again outside and Barrow tried to get to them, but security personnel stopped him. Then a witness heard him say: \"I've been sparing y'all because of Merv,\" \"I've got bond money\" and \"I'm gonna catch me a body tonight.\"\nOne of the victims - Nathaniel Kendrick - came out of the club saying, \"You gotta shoot me, you gotta shoot me.\"\nOne witness heard him say: \"Y'all wanna fight? You wanna shoot me?\" He took a fighting stance.\nWitnesses said Barrow shot into the air and then into the crowd with a black 9mm semi-automatic pistol. Others just said he fired into the crowd.\nThey also reported seeing Smith and King shooting into the crowd or at Nathaniel Kendrick.\nOf the 21 shell casings found, 13 were from one gun, four from another and four a third weapon, according to FDLE reports cited in the arrest affidavits.\nSmith's arrest report includes a conversation he had with a girl he has known for five or six years. The report states she is one of the few females he trusts, and he's a like a brother to her.\nHe told her he was at Cloud 9 and shot into the crowd, according to the arrest report. \"She stated that while they were speaking he did not seem to show any remorse. ... He informed her that he got kicked out of the club, and was 'beefing' with an individual in the club. He stated that he was not shooting at anyone, but rather she believed he was shooting just to shoot.\"\nThe Sheriff's Office has put Cloud 9 on notice - to clean up its act or face foreclosure - over alleged drug-related and other criminal activity on the property."}
