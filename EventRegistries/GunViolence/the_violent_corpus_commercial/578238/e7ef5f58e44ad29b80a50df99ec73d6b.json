The party was at a 43-acre property in Webster Township, about 45 minutes south of the Twin Cities. The violence drew personnel from seven law enforcement agencies.\nA woman was shot in the chest, and three men were also wounded. All four were said to be in stable condition. No arrests have been made.\nAttendee Angela Williams, 19, said \u201ceverybody was dancing and the music was a little loud when some stuff happened at the front gate.\u201d She said there were people inside a big shed fighting. \u201cThat\u2019s when the DJ said everyone had to clear out.\n\u201cOne guy came out of the house with an AR-15 and started shooting in the air and said, \u2018Everyone has to go,\u2019 \u201d Williams said. Then she heard more gunfire.\n\u201cEveryone was running around like chickens with their heads cut off,\u201d she said.\nWilliams said she came upon the woman who was shot, and \u201cI was trying to help her. She said, \u2018I have kids.\u2019 \u201d\nThe Mansion Party web page did not reveal the location of the gathering until an RSVP was submitted for the 18-and-older event. \u201cSecurity will be strictly enforced,\u201d the web page declared. \u201cLeave all drama & weapons at home.\u201d\nWilliams said there was security at the front gate, and a handful of men in black T-shirts patrolled the property. She said she saw one of them with a shotgun.\nPeople clearly too young to drink alcohol were being served, she said. The bar was charging $4 for shots of whiskey, vodka and other forms of hard liquor, she said.\nCounty Commissioner Jeff Docken, whose district includes Webster Township, said, \u201cWe knew [afterward] there was alcohol involved and the possibility of minors drinking involved. Whatever they were doing was against the law.\u201d\nAnthony Webster, who lives in Prior Lake and is an acquataince of the property's owner, said Sunday said he was aware of the party and that it was arranged by his stepson. He then declined to say more to the Star Tribune.\nDunn asked that anyone with information or audio or video contact the Sheriff\u2019s Office at 1-507-334-4391."}
