It happened around 1:30 a.m. Responding officers discovered what authorities called a chaotic scene.\nThe party was so crowded that some people believed the gunshots were fireworks, Capt. Brian Fitzgerald said at a news conference Sunday afternoon.\nPolice have stepped up patrols in the area and are gathering information from witnesses and from the victims.\nPolice have not identified a motive and are investigating whether the suspects were partygoers, Fitzgerald said.\n\"We are going to have an arrest in the very near future,\" Chief Armando J. Perez said.\nAs of Sunday afternoon, all but five of the victims had been released from hospitals. Most of the victims were shot in the legs. None of the injuries is considered life-threatening, but one woman was in critical condition with injuries to her face and jaw, according to authorities.\nPolice said the victims ranged in age from about 18 to 24. They're investigating whether the shooting is related to gang activity in the area.\nAmong those shot was Chris Rafael, who said he was hit in the leg while running away from the gunfire. He said he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\"They said I'll be good but Wednesday I have to go back to see how long for recovery,\" he said.\nThe people who threw the party have not been identified by police. They had requested a permit from police ahead of the gathering because they wanted to sell alcohol there, but the permit was denied, according to Perez.\nPolice believe they charged for alcohol anyway. They may face criminal charges, Fitzgerald said.\nLast summer, one man was killed and eight people were injured when two men opened fire on a group of people in the parking lot of the Trumbull Gardens housing complex in the city's North End. Among the injured was a grandmother taking a shower in her nearby home. Two were arrested.\nThe Trumbull Gardens complex is located about 3 miles northwest of where Sunday's shooting took place."}
