The victim died at an area hospital several hours after the shooting, in which multiple people were hit.\nAnother person died at the scene of the shooting on First Street near Cousin Street at around 1:30 a.m. Six other victims are in stable or guarded condition at local hospitals, Detective Daniel Seuzeneau said.\nDuring a Thursday afternoon news conference, Slidell police identified the men who died as Errol Scott, 22, and Mark Womack, 23. Both are from Slidell.\nSlidell Police Chief Randy Smith said Scott, who died at the scene of the shooting, was a target. Womack was an innocent bystander, Smith said.\nSlidell police say they've identified a potential suspect, but will not release any info yet citing \"sensitive nature of the investigation.\"\nAuthorities said gunshots rang out around 1:30 a.m. Thursday as the bars were closing. Slidell police said witnesses reported there was fighting near the intersection of First and Cousin streets and that during that altercation several gunshots were fired into the crowd.\nAdam Cannon, 27, said he was with friends at one of the area's bars, Shooters, and headed outside when the bar closed. He said there had been a few altercations inside the bar during the night and that they started up again outside in the street. Cannon said there were a lot of people outside the bar.\n\"Everything was moving so fast. I heard gunfire and took off,'' he said. \"I didn't see anything - I just heard the shots. I just kept running.''\nCannon's good friend, Quinterol Jackson, was one of those hit by the gunfire. Jackson was struck in the stomach and leg, Cannon's mother, Valerie Cannon, said. Valerie Cannon said Jackson, who is so close to her she calls him her \"son,'' was was recovering at Interim LSU Public Hospital in New Orleans.\nAdam Cannon said he came to Jackson's aid after the gunfire.\n\"He was bleeding,'' Adam Cannon said. \"I gave him my shirt to use to try and stop the bleeding. I stayed with him until they put him in the ambulance.''\nAdam Cannon said another friend was shot in the foot.\nSeuzeneau said authorities believe an \"ongoing feud\" was re-ignited inside one of the bars and at some point spilled out onto the street. Seuzeneau said police believe there was one shooter.\nThe shooter fired several shots into a crowd, he said.\nThe injured were taken to Ocshner Medical Center in Slidell, Slidell Memorial Hospital and to Interim LSU Public Hospital in New Orleans, Seuzeneau said.\n\"We are confident we will find the person and or persons responsible for the shooting last night,\" he said Thursday morning.\nPolice responded quickly, he said. The Slidell Police Department is on Third Street, about two blocks from the scene of the shooting.\nNearly nine hours after the shooting, First Street remained an active crime scene. Yellow police tape blocked off the street for two blocks between Robert and Bouscaren. Yellow evidence cones were scattered in front of Shooters bar. A Bud Light bottle sat in the middle of the cones.\nSeveral Slidell police cars, as well as the department's crime scene investigation vans sat inside the tape.\nSeveral businesses in the area have surveillance cameras, and Seuzeneau said police are using that footage in their investigation.\nA woman who lives on Cousin Street about a block and a half blocks from the scene of the shooting said she didn't hear shots or police sirens early Thursday. The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she has lived near the bar district in Old Towne for several years and that there never are problems.\n\"I feel safe here,\" she said.\nSeuzeneau said police haven't encountered many issues in that area, other than an occasional bar fight.\nClosing time for bars in Slidell is 2 a.m., said Slidell City Councilman Lionel Hicks, whose council district includes the Olde Towne area. Hicks said the bars in the area, at least in recent years, have not generated a lot of complaints that he has heard.\n\"Every now and then, but it's nothing out of the ordinary,'' Hicks said.\nCouncilwoman Kim Harbison, whose at large district also includes Olde Towne, echoed that. She said she does not hear a lot of complaints from constituents about the bars in Olde Towne.\n\"Some for noise, but that's with any bar,'' Harbison said.\nShe said the shooting Thursday was troubling.\n\"Slidell's always been a beautiful, wonderful town,'' Harbison said. \"We have never had a whole lot of trouble.''\nAdam Cannon said fights occasionally occur at Shooters, but that nothing ever has happened on the scale of Thursday.\n\"This was a whole other level,'' he said.\nCheck back with NOLA.com for more on this breaking story.\nReporter Bob Warren contributed to this report."}
