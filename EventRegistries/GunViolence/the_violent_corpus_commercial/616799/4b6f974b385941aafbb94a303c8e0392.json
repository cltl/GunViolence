He was returned to Indianapolis Tuesday evening. The 18-year veteran police officer faces a single charge of attempted murder for opening fire and hitting Sgt. Robert Pearsey at least one time in the arm.\n\u201cThis case, to this point anyway, is built primarily on civilian witness statements, who observed what happened and on that instance it's no different than any attempted murder case,\u201d said Marion County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Denise Robinson.\nBut it is unusual: one officer opening fire on another. Pearsey was shot while investigating a domestic disturbance. Pearsey is a member of IMPD's special investigation unit. He was at the residence in relation to a domestic violence report involving Aurs and his wife, who are in the process of divorcing. Legal experts were surprised by the charge of attempted murder.\n\u201cWe have to show, in an attempted murder charge, that at the time the shots were fired, the shooter acted with specific intent to kill and that does make it one of the more difficult charges in Indiana to prove,\u201d said Robinson.\nBut they say Aurs knew what he was doing.\n\u201cHe fired multiple shots, that he certainly, as a police officer, but even as a civilian, a police officer would certainly know the ramifications of shooting someone multiple times,\u201d said Robinson.\nAnd while some have suggested a special prosecutor or judge from another county might be necessary because of potential conflicts of interest, at this point, the case will be prosecuted in Marion County.\n\u201cHe's a person just like any other person and it's a crime just as would be any other crime that is an attempt murder crime,\u201d said Robinson.\nAurs faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of attempted murder.\nHe has been suspended from IMPD without pay. The department has recommended to the police merit board that he be fired."}
