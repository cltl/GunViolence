They arrived in less than a minute.\nPolice said a family was having a get together and it appeared that more than 20 people were inside the home when the gunfire began. Many people were running away from the home when officers arrived.\nAntonio Mason, 35, died at the scene after suffering gunshot wounds to the chest, GPD said.\nMason was holding his 11-month-old daughter at the time, who was also shot in the arm.\nAnother man, 21, suffered a gunshot wound to his arm. He and the infant were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries and are expected to recover, GPD said.\nThe shooters fled the scene before police arrived and have not been identified. One of the occupants tried to run after the shooters, but was unsuccessful, GPD said.\nMason did not live in the home where the shooting happened. A motive for the shooting is unknown, but police said the home appears to have been targeted.\nGPD said officers found shell casings from two different weapons, but investigators are still working to try to determine the shooters' identities. K-9 units and the Joint Aviation Unit's helicopter were used to look for them.\n\u201cWhat kind of person can point a gun at a father holding an infant and make the barbaric decision to pull that trigger? There is no excuse whatsoever for this to happen,\u201d GPD Officer Ben Tobias said. \u201cWe are expending every resource we have available to try to identify and capture those responsible for this horrendous act of violence.\"\nResidents have been advised to stay in their homes for safety as Gainesville police search the area.
