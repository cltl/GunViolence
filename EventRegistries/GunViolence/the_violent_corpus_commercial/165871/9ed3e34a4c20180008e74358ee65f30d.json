Lincoln just before 5 p.m. Tuesday when he accidentally shot himself in the chest, Lt. Jeff Gilmore said.\nJahmez died a short time later while undergoing surgery at Via Christi Hospital St. Francis, Gilmore said.\nMario T. Benjamin, 30, the boyfriend of Jahmez\u2019s mother, was later booked into the Sedgwick County Jail on suspicion of criminal possession of a firearm.\nJahmez pulled a chair next to the kitchen counter, climbed onto the counter so he could reach cabinets above the refrigerator and reach into the cabinet for the handgun, Gilmore said.\n\u201cIt would appear the gun went off while he was standing on the kitchen cabinet\u201d before getting down to the floor, Gilmore said.\nBenjamin and the mother of the four children in the house were asleep in a back bedroom for \u201ca long time\u201d at the house leading up to the shooting, Gilmore said. An investigation revealed one of the children had shown the gun to the others earlier in the day.\n\u201cChildren, being curious as they are, went and located the gun again and played with the gun,\u201d Gilmore said.\nSisters ages 6 and 8 were playing in another room at the time of the shooting, he said, while Jahmez and his 7-year-old brother were in the kitchen.\nThe incident remains under investigation, he said, and charges related to the shooting remain possible.\nBenjamin served prison time after being sentenced in 2007 for aggravated assault committed in 2006, Kansas Department of Corrections records show. He also has a domestic battery conviction for a crime committed in 2011, records show. He is being held on $5,000 bond.\n\u201cHe is a convicted felon and can not possess a firearm,\u201d Gilmore said of Benjamin.\nJahmez\u2019s mother did not realize there was a gun in the house, Gilmore said. Benjamin lived there with her and the children.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so vitally important, with the curiosity of children, to keep the guns out of reach, unloaded and secured,\u201d Gilmore said.\nGun safes, locked boxes, trigger guards, and cables that prevent guns from being loaded are among the options gun owners have for keeping loaded weapons away from children.\nTuesday\u2019s shooting was the second time in three months that a Wichita child was shot to death at home. On April 30, a 19-month old boy died shortly after being shot in the chest after three young children found a gun.\nIn the April shooting, three children \u2013 ages 3, 4 and 19 months \u2013 found a handgun stored in a nightstand at a house in the 1300 block of North Pennsylvania.\nThe 4-year-old pulled the trigger, and the bullet struck his younger brother, according to police. The 33-year-old father of the children and his brother were in another room at the time.\nThat case remains under review."}
