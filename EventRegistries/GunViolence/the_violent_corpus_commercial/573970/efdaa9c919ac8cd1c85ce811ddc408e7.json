I thought I cleared it.\u201d\nAccording to an incident report, the teen told investigators the pair were going to shoot birds in the back yard when he accidentally fired a pump action shotgun loaded with bird shot. It hit Fluty in the back from between six and nine feet away, deputies said.\nThere were no adults home at the time, according to investigators.\nFluty\u2019s grandmother, Carleen Fluty, said she happened to be listening to a police scanner at her home when she heard the dispatch.\n\u201cI heard the Sheriff ask again for the address, and I said, \u2018oh my God, that\u2019s my grandson,\u201d Fluty said.\nShe said she rushed to the house, where she saw her grandson on the living room floor being attended to by first responders. He was flown to Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center in Toledo, where he underwent more than five hours of surgery Tuesday. Fluty said several organs were damaged.\n\u201cObviously it was an accident,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know the full details, but I\u2019m a wreck.\u201d\nErie County Sheriff Paul Sigsworth said detectives met with officials from the Erie County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, but a decision on potential charges will not be made until the investigation is completed.\n\u201cFirst of all, we have to make every determination we can that it was purely accidental. It certainly appears to be at this time, but we have not been able to get a good detailed statement from the victim,\u201d Sigsworth said.\nSigsworth said the incident is a reminder that guns should always be treated as if they\u2019re loaded, and adults need to supervise children around guns.\n\u201cWeapons should always be secured within the household,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guns were not secured within the household. They were accessible to these boys and this is the tragic result.\u201d\nCarleen Fluty said her grandson had experience hunting from a young age, and the guns should\u2019ve been locked up, as there was a gun cabinet in the house.\n\u201cWe need all the support we can get, we need prayers for Matthew and his dad,\u201d she said. \u201cHis dad is a single father trying to make a living for both of them.\u201d\nThe mother of the 15-year-old declined comment to Fox 8 News."}
