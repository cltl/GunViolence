We understand one child, the five year old, was in a car in the driveway of a home on Schoolcrest, when he found a handgun in the car and pulled the trigger.\nPolice tell us the 5-year-old boy found the gun somewhere in the car, and when he pulled the trigger, the gunshot injured his hand and it also his 6-year-old sister in the thigh, who was getting into the car.\nThe children were getting into the car because their grandmother was getting ready to take them to a home where the children are homeschooled.\nNo adults were in the car.\nWhen emergency responders arrived, the children were immediately taken to the Clare hospital and then taken to Covenant Healthcare in Saginaw where they have non-life threatening injuries.\nThe nine millimeter handgun was registered to a male member of the family who had a concealed pistol license.\nClare Police Chief Brian Gregory says this is reminder to anyone to know where their firearms are at all times and that they are properly secured.\nThe chief says the police report will be forwarded to the prosecutor's office to review for possible criminal charges."}
