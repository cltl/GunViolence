Flamenco Vivo II to Perform at Ansonia Theatre Whirls of colorful dresses, explosions of clicking castanets, strumming guitars\nand stamping feet. Vivacious and passionate dancers, singers, and musicians sharing the Spanish flamenco tradition. Experience the passion and excitement with Flamenco Vivo II at the Ansonia Theatre on Friday, September 27th.\nFlamenco Vivo II is one of the nation's premier flamenco and Spanish dance companies. Flamenco Vivo II Carlota Santana was established in 1983 by Carlota Santana and Roberto Lorca. The company is now based in New York City, North Carolina and Madrid, Spain. Carlota Santana has been designated \"The Keeper of Flamenco\" by Dance Magazine in recognition of her commitment to creating new works and developing young artists and choreographers. She has dedicated her company to the mission of connecting cultures using the universal spirit of flamenco. During its 30-year history, the company has used this multicultural art form to build bridges between cultures and inspire audiences from diverse cultures.\nWhat is the Soul of Flamenco? It is not only the performers themselves, but what they carry inside - the impassioned investment of each dancer, singer, and musician. Flamenco is an expression of feeling, a community built on emotions. Happiness, sadness, joy, and sorrow are translated through this eloquent art form, expressing the vital essence that lives within each of us. These universal emotions are shared across time and physical boundaries, and are the foundation of Flamenco. The seeds of Flamenco were planted many years ago by different cultures. Today it has blossomed into a theater art performed throughout the world. Flamenco originated in southern Spain in the region called Andaluc\u00c3a. Its influences include Gypsies, Jews, Arabs and Christians.\nA special way of showing support in flamenco is to shout \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ol\u00c3\u00a9!\u00e2\u20ac This is a Spanish way of telling the performers you like what you see. You are invited to shout \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ol\u00c3\u00a9!\u00e2\u20ac when you clap at the end of each dance.\nThe performance will be at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, September 27th at the Ansonia Theatre. Tickets are available for $12 at the Anson County Arts Council (704-694-4950) or via PayPal on the website www.ansoniatheatre.com.
