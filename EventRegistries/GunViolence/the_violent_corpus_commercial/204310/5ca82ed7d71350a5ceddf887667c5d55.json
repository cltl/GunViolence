The family gave us a photo of Carlita, who is pictured with her 18-month-old daughter.\nSunday night, Dallas Bidwell's family identified him as another victim in the March Lane shooting. Bidwell was 19 years old.\nHis relatives said they had no idea why anyone would want to kill the teen.\nThe shooting on March Lane came just hours after a 28-year-old man was shot and killed in a family dispute at a home in the 1500 block of Bordeaux Avenue.\nAndy Hem, 21, has been arrested in that case.\nAbout 10 minutes after that shooting, police received a report of another shooting that claimed the life of a 26-year-old gang member. No names or further details have been released in the incident.\nKCRA 3's Melinda Meza contributed to this report."}
