There, they found 18-year-old Kodi Pruner with a gunshot wound to the head.\nHe was taken to Eskenazi Hospital in critical condition, where he was later pronounced brain dead.\nAccording to court documents, 49-year-old William Zweck was intoxicated as he approached his nephew, Kodi Pruner, with a .22-caliber revolver and pointed it at him. When Pruner moved to push the gun away, the gun went off, firing a bullet through Pruner's right eye and into his brain.\nWitnesses showed officers to Zweck's nearby home, where they found him sitting in a chair in his driveway, according to court documents. Before officers could ask him questions, Zweck told police it was an accident and that he didn't mean to shoot Pruner.\nWhile being taken in for questioning, Zweck again told officers he didn't mean to hurt Pruner.\n\"I should have come outside with the gun in my hands, so you guys would have shot me,\" he told police.\nHe continued: \"My sister will never forgive me.\"\nPruner died Tuesday morning after life support was ended, according to court documents.\nZweck was charged Tuesday with reckless homicide, pointing a firearm and carrying a handgun without a license.\nCall IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156.
