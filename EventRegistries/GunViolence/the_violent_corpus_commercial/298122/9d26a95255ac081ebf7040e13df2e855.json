Amid the mayhem, authorities also found Aldridge\u2019s mother, Alice L. Aldridge, 74, dead in her home from what appeared to be natural causes.\n\u201cThe town is devastated,\u201d resident Nora Shriver said Friday afternoon as mounds of dirty snow from past storms covered the Texas County landscape, 95 miles east of Springfield. \u201cHalf of the town got killed last night.\u201d\nShe and her husband, John, counted three of the victims as family.\nMany in Tyrone, where Aldridge family members make up much of the population, think that finding his mother dead on the couch may have sent the son over the edge.\n\u201cHe just lost it,\u201d said one resident, who wanted to remain anonymous because few details about the family had been released by officials. \u201cThey think when she died, he went berserk and took it out on everybody else.\u201d\nAuthorities say Joseph Aldridge traveled to four homes in the dark of night, shooting each victim multiple times with a .45-caliber handgun. The first 911 call, at 10:15 p.m., came from a girl who had run to a neighbor\u2019s house barefoot through the snow and single-digit temperatures after she heard the gunshots that killed her parents.\nMost victims were found on the floors of their bedrooms, said Texas County Coroner Tom Whittaker.\n\u201cOne lady was still in the bed,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cYou could tell she was trying to cover her face. She had pulled a pillow up.\u201d\nAnother man and woman appeared to have opened the door for Aldridge before they were shot.\nThe Missouri Highway Patrol identified four of the victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, and his wife, Julie Ann Aldridge, 47; and Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife, Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. The two men were cousins of Joseph Aldridge.\nAuthorities did not release the names of the three remaining victims Friday. But Nora and John Shriver identified them as John\u2019s cousin Darrell Shriver; Darrell\u2019s son, Carey Shriver; and Carey\u2019s wife, Valerie Shriver. Darrell\u2019s wife, Martha, was shot but survived. Family members said she had undergone surgery in a Springfield hospital.\nThe killings, according to authorities, occurred within about 3 miles of one another. None of the homes had signs of forced entry.\nInvestigators were confident they had found all the victims.\n\u201cWe checked a wide area, door to door,\u201d said Texas County Sheriff James Sigman. \u201cWe checked other family members in other areas.\u201d\nWhen Whittaker first got the call, he was told he had two crime scenes, three fatalities and one survivor.\n\u201cI got to the first house, and I had two bodies there,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cThey said, \u2018You got another one off down (Highway) 137. I see a sheriff\u2019s deputy and he says, \u2018Well, I have this older lady down here and it appears to be a natural death.\u2019\u201d\nThen, within Whittaker\u2019s sight, emergency lights flashed at another crime scene. And before long, he heard of yet another, with two more bodies.\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018What is this guy doing? What have people done to cause him to go around and start killing everybody?\u2019\u201d\nAuthorities fanned out along county roads and highways, searching for Aldridge. Officers found him before dawn Friday, slumped over in a GMC pickup in the middle of a highway in Shannon County, just to the east.\nHe had spent time in federal prison after pleading guilty in 2008 to possessing a firearm, a .22-caliber handgun, while being a user of marijuana, according to federal court records. He was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison and was released in February 2010.\nResidents in the Tyrone community say he was quiet and kept to himself. He had lived with his mother for several years.\n\u201cI think the whole area is in shock right now,\u201d said Jack Watson, who lives in Solo, Mo., about 5 miles west of Tyrone. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect it (the area) big-time.\u201d\nTexas County hadn\u2019t had a homicide in about 11/2 years, Sigman said. And the deadliest crime Whittaker has worked in nearly 18 years as coroner was a double homicide.\n\u201cCrime like this in any community is pretty major,\u201d Sigman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you\u2019re used to seeing.\u201d\n\u2018She was screaming\u2019\nJohn Shriver had already gone to bed when the phone rang at 10:30 Thursday night. It was Martha Shriver.\n\u201cShe was screaming,\u201d Shriver said. \u201cShe was panicked. She wanted Carey. ... And she couldn\u2019t get a hold of him.\u201d\nJohn Shriver got dressed and went down to Carey Shriver\u2019s home. No answer at the door. He went in and found Carey and Valerie Shriver dead on their bedroom floor.\nWhere was the couple\u2019s son? He hollered, but no answer.\nOutside, John Shriver said he saw a state trooper and county deputy and flashed his lights at them. After telling them what he had found at his relatives\u2019 home, John Shriver led them back to the house.\n\u201cThey have a boy,\u201d Shriver told the officers. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t find him.\u201d\nIn a bedroom, at the opposite side of the home as his parents\u2019 room, they found a 13-year-old boy in his bed.\nOne of the officers shined a flashlight, waking him.\nHe hadn\u2019t heard a thing.\nJohn Shriver took the boy back to his home. The boy, who had been told by officers about his parents\u2019 deaths, was quiet along the way.\nThe boy\u2019s sister, a college student in Springfield, picked him up Friday morning.\nUnanswered questions\nJust after dawn Friday morning, on buses headed to schools inside the Houston R-1 School District, children spoke of little else.\nSome of the district\u2019s 1,000 kids come from Tyrone. Others have family and friends who live in that area.\n\u201cWe have a lot of scared and confused students here today trying to make sense of this,\u201d said Scott Dill, superintendent of the Houston district, who received a call Thursday night about the killings. \u201cMy kids are shaken up, every single one of them.\u201d\nIn nearby Summersville R-II School District, administrators and teachers had been alerted to the shooting rampage. Some children in the district were related to those who died.\nThose children, said Superintendent Merlyn Johnson, weren\u2019t at school Friday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready for when these students come back,\u201d Johnson said.\nYears ago, Tyrone was more of a town, with a store, even a small school and post office. Now it\u2019s mainly homes and fields, where cows graze off the main roads.\nAfter Thursday evening, it will be known for a mass killing committed by a man who had grown up in the area and was related to many in his tiny community.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to figure out if him finding her deceased caused some problems with him, as far as getting a little bit crazy,\u201d said Whittaker, the county coroner. \u201cWe just won\u2019t know for sure. That\u2019s the horrible thing about this. With him deceased, there are going to be a lot of questions that go unanswered.\u201d\nThe impact, residents said, will be felt not only by people outside Tyrone and throughout Texas County, but across the region.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not related by blood, you are related by bonds of friendship,\u201d Dill said. \u201cThis is small-town America. When we cry, we all cry together down here.\u201d\nThe Star\u2019s Tony Rizzo contributed to this story.\nTo reach Laura Bauer, call 816-234-4944 or send email to lbauer@kcstar.com.\nTo reach Donald Bradley, call 816-234-4182 or send email to dbradley@kcstar.com.\nTo reach Glenn E.
