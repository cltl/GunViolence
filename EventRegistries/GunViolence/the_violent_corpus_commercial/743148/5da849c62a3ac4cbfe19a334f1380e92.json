It was on the floor. It was zipped up. And the child apparently unzipped the bag, found the handgun,\" Underwood said.\nThe SBI and the Union County Sheriff's Office are now investigating, but Underwood said, until the investigation is complete, he cannot speculate on charges. But there is a state statute about safely storing a gun.\nThe mother is back home recovering. No one at the home wanted to talk Thursday.\nOfficer Ferguson is on paid administrative leave, pending the investigation."}
