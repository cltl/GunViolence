The suspect walked into the breezeway at the Austin Oaks apartments, on Glenwood Avenue near Decatur, and started shooting shortly after 8 p.m., according to Cornelius Yarbro, assistant chief of detectives for DeKalb police.\n\u201cThis is something that the DeKalb police is not going to tolerate,\u201d Yarbro said. \u201cRest assured, we\u2019re going to find the person or people responsible for this.\u201d\nThree adults were taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds to the lower extremities, but their injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, according to police and fire officials.
