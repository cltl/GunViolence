Mark Rolland.\nThe suspect, who has not been apprehended, was described as an African-American male in his 30s, with the sides of his head \"shaved,\" according to Lt. Rolland. He drove away from the scene in a 2007-09 dark, two-door Honda Civic, which police are still searching for.\nThe victims, a 10-year-old girl and a 19-year-old woman, were transported to Bay State Medical Center, police said.\nThe 10-year-old was shot in the leg and the 19-year-old was shot through the buttocks, according to Rolland. The victims' injuries are believed to be non-life-threatening.\nIt is so far unclear as to whether the victims were involved in the verbal altercation, or if they were randomly targeted, according to Lt. Rolland. Detectives are currently at Bay State talking to the 19-year-old in an attempt to discern what happened.\nRolland also said that there was a large crowd of children nearby when the suspect began firing. \"There were a lot of them,\" said Rolland, estimating at least 15 children were playing only a block away.\nAt least eight shell casings were recovered from what appeared to be a .22-caliber weapon.\nThis is a developing story that will be updated as reporting continues"}
