Go here for additional information on the arrest.\nA murder warrant has been issued for a 24-year-old man in connection to a shooting that left one woman dead and four injured in Downtown Austin early Sunday morning.\nFirst Shooting\nAustin police said they first responded to the 200 block of 6th Street after hearing reports of a woman shot just after 2:15 a.m.\nAustin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services confirmed the person killed was a woman in her 30s. Three other women in their 30s were taken to University Medical Center at Brackenridge with gunshot wounds while another woman refused transport to the hospital. All of them are expected to be okay.\nSunday night, police said the suspected gunman, Endicott McCray, 24, is still at large, but they've issued a murder warrant for his arrest.\nOfficials said they believe he may be armed. McCray is described as 5-feet 9-inches and 130 pounds with long corn rows and a goatee. Descriptions of the clothes he was last seen wearing have varied, according to the Austin Police Department. When he is arrested his bond will be set at $2 million, police confirm.\nFamily members of the woman killed identified her as Teqnika Moultrie, 30. Moultrie's brother Ricky, who lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, told KVUE over the phone that Teqnika was in town visiting her fianc\u00e9e when she was shot on 6th Street. He said he's still in shock after learning the news of her death.\nIn San Francisco, crowds gathered Sunday night to honor Moultrie, who was a bus driver in the Bay Area. Co-workers and friends held a tribute at a school bus yard, placing flowers on a bus and turning on its lights. Friends said Moultrie loved working as a bus driver.\nThose close to her said they will remember her upbeat spirit.\nFuneral arrangements for Moultrie are still pending.\nSecond Shooting\nAustin police said shortly after the first shooting was reported, they received another report of shots fired at a parking garage on 8th and Trinity streets.\nAPD said a man pulled out a gun and fired it. He was taken down by witnesses at the scene, and EMS took him to the hospital.\nInitially, Austin police believed the shootings downtown were connected because they happened in a short period of time. However after police arrived on the scene, they realized the incidents were separate.\nAustin police Chief Art Acevedo issued a statement around 8 a.m. Sunday regarding the shootings that read:\nOn behalf of the Austin Police Department we wish to extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the young woman who lost her life to this senseless act of violence and wishes for a speedy recovery to the individuals wounded.\nThe men and women of the Austin Police Department will work tireless to identify and apprehend the person responsible. As part of our efforts we urge anyone with personal video of the shooting or its aftermath to submit it via email to police3@austintexas.gov. Anyone with information can also call the Homicide Division tip-line at (512) 477-3588.\nAustin, Texas is one of our nation's safest cities and the community we serve partners with APD to stand up for our neighbors and friends and to bring those that would do us harm to justice. This sensors and tragic incident will be no exception.\n(\u00a9 2017 KVUE)"}
