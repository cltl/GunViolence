Lancaster did not intend to harm Olivia Stull and the two had not been fighting, defense attorney Stephen McGowan said. In fact, the two were getting ready to paint together when Lancaster placed the gun against her back and pulled the trigger with the intent of making a clicking sound, he said.\n\"This is a really unfortunate situation,\" McGowan said. \"It's terrible what happened.\"\nLancaster, 21, is charged with reckless homicide, a third-degree felony, in the Wednesday evening shooting at an apartment on Ridge Road in Brooklyn.\nStull, 18, of Parma, was pronounced dead after being taken to MetroHealth, officials said.\nLancaster waived his right to a preliminary hearing Thursday in Parma Municipal Court. His case has been bound over to Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court.\nJudge Timothy Gilligan set bond at 10 percent of $25,000.\nLancaster has been under suicide watch since the shooting, McGowan said. McGowan informed Gilligan that he would ask Lancaster's family to seek treatment if he is released from custody.\nMembers of Lancaster's family arrived in court shortly after his hearing ended but declined to comment.\nLancaster called the Brooklyn Police Department immediately after the shooting and said he shot his roommate, police said.\nParamedics took Stull to MetroHealth.\nMcGowan said Lancaster and Stull had not been drinking or taking drugs."}
