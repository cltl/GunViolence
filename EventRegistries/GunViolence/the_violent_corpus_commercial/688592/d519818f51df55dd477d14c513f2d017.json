A fight started outside in the front yard when they were asked to leave. Shortly after, shots were fired. Police responded just before 5 a.m. Sunday\n\"I thought all of those gunshots were just warning shots shot in the air. I didn't even turn around (or) look back. I didn't want to see,\" Mata said.\nPolice said four men and one woman were shot. The victims include one of Mata's closest friends, amateur boxer Luis Carrasco.\n\"It was a shotgun. We don't know what gauge of shotgun it was, and it was about three to four feet away, and he (Carrasco) got shot right in the abdomen,\" Mata said.\nThe party host said he won't throw another party as a result of the experience. He also regrets not calling the police when the party crashers first arrived.\n\"At the time there was a female leaving in an Uber, and the Uber driver saw the person running towards the party with the shotgun. He thought it was part of his costume,\" Mata said.\nMata's biggest focus now is supporting Carrasco during his long road to recovery. Carrasco was scheduled to make his pro-boxing debut in December.
