I didn't even get a chance to see him. I was upstairs in my room and he ran through the kitchen door and said, 'Claudia, call the police! Call the paramedics! Devie's been shot!\"\nSeveral residents stood outside the police tape. Relatives at the scene said the boy suffered a gunshot wound to the chest, but that had not been confirmed by authorities.\nFamily members and friends rushed to the scene. Two young boys on bicycles waited outside the police tape.\nOne woman swiftly walked up to one of the boys asking, \"What happened?\"\nHe anxiously replied, \"Where's my brother?\"\nAs the group prepared to drive to Comer, one relative received a call that made everyone in the group frantic.\n\"He's gone!\" one woman yelled.\nA man who was next door at the time of the shooting said he rushed outside when police cars and an ambulance arrived. Shortly after, he said the youngest of the four boys who lived in the house was carried away on a stretcher.\n\"I don't think anyone should have to bury their own child,\" said Bernard Warfield, 22, as he consoled one of the victim's older brothers. \"That makes me not want to have kids again. Now, three boys have to grow up without their baby brother.\"\nGroups of emotional family members showed up at the scene, including one woman who frantically cried as she ran past crime scene tape. A man and another woman, followed soon after and ducked under the tape that cordoned off the area before they were stopped by officers.\nAnother man sped to the scene in a car, abruptly stopping the car and getting out when he could go no farther. He was sobbing while he walked up to the tape and demanded to be let in.\n\"I need to get over there, man. I need to see my baby though, man,\" he said.\nHe left speeding backward in his car, almost getting hit by another car at a nearby intersection.\nEarlier Sunday, Christian Ortiz, 23, was killed in a shooting in the Albany Park neighborhood that also critically wounded a 26-year-old man.
