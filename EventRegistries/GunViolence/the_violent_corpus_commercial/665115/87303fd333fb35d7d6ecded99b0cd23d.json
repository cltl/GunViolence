(WSAV) \u2013 A heavy amount of police scattered across Yamacraw Village after a mother and daughter were shot around 4:30 p.m. September 27 near the intersection of Fahm and Zubley Street. It\u2019s a concern for community leaders near the area.\n\u201cI thought it was sad and anybody getting shot, and then a child too, I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s going on,\u201d Ronald Williams, West Savannah Community President, said.\nJust last week metro police upped the force in this area. They asked for assistance from Georgia State Patrol and they made their presence clear at Tuesday\u2019s shooting. But having the increase of officers is not what Williams says is needed.\n\u201cYou can get twice as many police as you have now,\u201d Williams said. \u201cUntil people start speaking out it\u2019s going to continue.\u201d\nNews 3 reached out to neighbors in the area who didn\u2019t want to speak out. Even police were trying to find answers.\n\u201cInvestigators are asking anyone who has seen anything please come forward,\u201d Darnisha Green, a metro public information officer, said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about cooperation with the police,\u201d Williams added. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to help them help us.\u201d\nHelp Williams says wouldn\u2019t be needed if the community focused more in the positivity in the community.\n\u201cWe focus on the positive things. If you can get people to focus on the positive things you won\u2019t get things like this to occur.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a conversation we can all sink our teeth into!
