Teutonia Ave., about 12:45 a.m. Saturday are expected to survive. A motive for the shooting has not been determined and no suspects are in custody, Sgt. Mark Stanmeyer said Monday.\nAccording to a review of licensing records for Zarko's Nightclub, police have been summoned to the bar before.\nOn Jan. 12, police were called to the bar on a \"shots fired\" complaint. Police later determined that someone fired a gun near the bar, striking an auto owned by a security guard in the bar's parking lot. No arrests were made.\nOn July 19 of last year, police investigated a complaint of one bar patron striking another.\nRecords indicate that police responded to several complaints in 2011 and 2009. In November 2009, the brother-in-law of owner Michael Tsirlin was killed in an apparent robbery attempt.\nIn April at a meeting of the Common Council's Licenses Committee, Ald. Joe Dudzik noted that the club had received \"multiple\" warning letters from police.\nAs a result, the committee voted to renew the license for the club with the caveat that the club be limited to 100 people.\nWhen the license went before the full Common Council on April 30, Ald. Ashanti Hamilton made a motion to renew the license without the capacity restriction. The matter passed on an 8-7 vote.\nTsirlin has not returned a phone call requesting comment.\nAshley Luthern of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report."}
