The dad saw the rabbit coming and told the son to get ready. We can\u2019t surmise how the gun went off, but the 9 year old probably got excited,\u201d Sartor said, saying the son apparently didn\u2019t have the safety on.\nThe gun blast occurred anywhere from 10 to 20 yards from the father, according to Sartor. However, neither the father or son could show officers exactly where they were standing when the shooting occurred. The son was carrying a 20-gauge double barrel shotgun loaded with a field load.\nThe father was wearing thickly woven hunting pants and the pellets didn\u2019t penetrate deeply into his flesh, Sartor said.\nSartor checked on the father again Sunday and the father said he was doing fine and that the pellets did not damage his knee cap."}
