Michele Pihera said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t yet determined if criminal charges will be filed due to the ages of the parties involved.\u201d\nThe friend is under the age of 10, Pihera said, not giving the exact age.\nDetails on exactly how or why the shooting, which wasn\u2019t fatal, happened in the street that day remain unknown. So does the glaring question: How did the children get a gun?\nPihera said she didn\u2019t know whose it was.\nThe case suddenly seems familiar, similar to that of Alan Martinez, an 11-year-old Summerour Middle student who died while reportedly playing with a gun along with a friend in his garage in Norcross. Martinez died the day before Ni-Shawn got shot.\nThe latest news on Ni-Shawn\u2019s case comes after weeks of mystery surrounding the incident, which sent him to an Atlanta hospital in critical condition before he was released days later. Police said they believed there were several potential witnesses who weren\u2019t talking.\nBut Pihera said police in recent days revisited the neighborhood to talk to residents and conducted additional interviews.\nIn the aftermath, there was tension in the neighborhood, which police have described as home to many Bloods gang members.\nA woman on Caboose Court dialed 911 to report that a group of men came and interrupted a kids\u2019 party and Easter egg hunt. \u201cThey said somebody shot their kid or something like that,\u201d she said, adding that one of the men had a gun and was threatening to retaliate."}
