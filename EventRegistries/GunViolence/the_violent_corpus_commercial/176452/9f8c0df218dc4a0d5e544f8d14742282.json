He said his heart goes out to the family and he hopes everyone with guns will take caution.\n\"If you're going to have a gun and you have kids, please leave it unloaded and keep them locked up in a safe away from children,\" Emory said.\nThis is the second accidental gun death involving a child in just one week. Last Sunday, Karl Hills, 7 of White County, found a gun at his grandparents' house and accidentally fired it.\nClarksville police have decided not to comment on this latest incident.
