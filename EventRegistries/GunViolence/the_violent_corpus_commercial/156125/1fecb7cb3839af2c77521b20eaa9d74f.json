When officers arrived at the apartment several people were wounded, but \u201cnobody shared details about what happened,\u201d Miami-Dade police spokesman Det. Alvaro Zabaleta said Monday.\n\u201cThis is yet another scene where when investigators tried to get information, they were not getting assistance from the community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to break the code of silence.\u201d\nInvestigators identified one of the dead as Tyquavious Charles, 21. The name of the other man killed will be released after relatives are notified.\nA man identified as Ricky Hudson, 27, was shot multiple times and was in critical condition at Ryder Trauma Center. A woman, who was not identified, was recovering at Ryder after a bullet grazed her in the head.\nNeighborhood residents milled around Monday, most afraid to speak because of fear of retaliation.\n\u201cI heard four shots and then it sounded like a war,\u201d said one boy.\n\u201cThis is a community in crisis,\u201d said Cecilia Gutierrez-Abety, president and chief executive officer of the Miami Children\u2019s Initiative, a nonprofit organization that focuses on children in Liberty City. \u201cAnd its been this way for a long time. Shooting has a become a part of daily life here.\u201d\nShe was out with a group of volunteers and residents Monday, knocking on doors to calm nerves.\nSunday night\u2019s shooting happened right near the group\u2019s office, Gutierrez-Abety said. The two men lay dead for hours as police investigated.\n\u201cWe are really sad,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a total disregard for human life.\u201d\nZabaleta said police are looking to see whether there are any ties to a June 24 shooting outside a Liberty Square housing complex that killed two people and injured seven.\n\u201cAt this point in the investigation it is too early to tell,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we are not going to disregard the possibility.\u201d\nAnyone with information is asked to call Miami-Dade CrimeStoppers at 305-471-TIPS."}
