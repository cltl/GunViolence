The shooting happened about 1 a.m., police said.\n\"Everyone was just out there singing along to the music and having a good time, and I just saw some sparks and heard bangs and then it was chaos,\" said the man's mother, who said her last name is Matthews but declined to give her first name.\n\"I have no idea who they could've been \u2014 these kids [attending the party] go to school, they play sports, they're not involved in gangs, she added. \"There weren't even any altercations or arguments or anything like that at the party.\"\nParamedics pronounced one man, 22, dead on the scene after he was shot in the head, according to Officer Janel Sedevic, a Chicago Police spokeswoman. Matthews and her son said they did not know the man, but they thought he was a visitor from the South Side.\nTwo other men were taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, Sedevic said. One, 21, is in critical condition with gunshot wounds in his back and chest. The other, 20, is in fair condition with a gunshot wound in his stomach.\nPolice could not immediately provide the condition of a 19-year-old man who was shot twice in his thigh.\nA 24-year-old man was treated and released on scene for a graze wound on his arm, Sedevic said.\n\"After it happened I was just trying to get everyone inside, and I think someone else called the police,\" Matthews said. Others, she said, tried to jump over the backyard fence to flee.\nMatthews' son, who said he recently graduated from community college, is heading to Midwest Preparatory Academy next week. He said the celebration-turned-tragedy would leave a bitter memory as he leaves Chicago.\n\"It was just a giant shock. It was really traumatic for everyone here,\" he said.\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:"}
