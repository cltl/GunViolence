It was the first of two apparently accidental shootings of children in as many days.\nHe shot himself in the face about 6:15 p.m. Tuesday at a home in the 9700 block of Shady Tree Lane. The child, who has not been identified, was rushed to the Texas Medical Center, officials said.\nHarris County sheriff's deputies said the shooting appeared to be an accident. Deputies were still trying to confirm how the boy got his hands on the gun. Charges have yet to be filed in the case, and officials said they weren't sure if any would be.\nNo charges are expected in the more recent case after a 7-year-old accidentally shot himself in the head Wednesday when he got into his grandfather's locked gun cabinet in Brazoria County.\nThe incident happened about 11 a.m. in the 4000 block of East Texas 6 in Alvin, according to the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office.\nDeputies said the boy grabbed a .38-caliber revolver from the cabinet and pulled the trigger. The bullet went into the boy's forehead just below the hairline, traveled under the skin on the crown of his head and then exited without piercing his skull.\nThe boy is expected to recover.\nThe grandparents, deputies said, will not face any charges since their grandson had to make great efforts to the find the key to the locked gun cabinet.\nMike Glenn contributed to this report."}
