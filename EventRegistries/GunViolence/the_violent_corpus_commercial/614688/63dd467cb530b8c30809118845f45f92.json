The other two remain under investigation. The link to the Littleton burglaries was first reported by KDVR-TV.\n\u201cWe are still investigating, including how that firearm ended up in Edgewater,\u201d said Lisa Meiman, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nMackey said the 13-year-old had a through-and-through gunshot to his lower leg.\n\u201cThis is real concerning that it ends up here in Edgewater,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is, we\u2019re fortunate it wasn\u2019t worse. The shooting could have resulted in a homicide. The doctor said he was just a very lucky young man.\u201d\nThe gun shop burglaries happened on consecutive days, June 21 and 22.\nIn the first, 29 handguns were stolen from Colorado Gun Broker on West Bowles Avenue. The next day, burglars crashed a van into the entrance of Triple J Armory, on East County Line Road, stealing numerous firearms, most of them handguns.\nThe ATF said both burglaries remain under investigation. Mackey said it wasn\u2019t clear from which store the handgun involved in the teen\u2019s shooting was taken.\nEdgewater police, the ATF and Littleton police are investigating the gun thefts.\nSponsored Links\n.\nVital Reds SupplementHow To Fix Your Fatigue (Do This Every Day)Vital Reds Supplement\nScribolHikers Found This Horse Alone In The Woods.
