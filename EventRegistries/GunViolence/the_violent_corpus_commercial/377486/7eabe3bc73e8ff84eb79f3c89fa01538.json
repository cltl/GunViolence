Their bodies were found in an upstairs bedroom and investigators believe the father and son had been dead for days.\nThe mother was nearby, bleeding from what the sheriff says is a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, but her condition is not known.\n\"At this time, we believe the woman is responsible for the shooting and there is no one else at large,\" Elfo said. \"This appears to be an incident involving domestic violence.\"\nThe couple was identified as Michael D. Jordan and Erin Agren by a spokesperson for Lummi Nation School, where both were teachers. School officials said the couple met while teaching at the school. Michael had been there for 8 years while Erin taught for a year before leaving a couple years ago to become a full-time mother, the spokesperson said.\nShe said the entire school is \"devastated\" by the news as the entire school system is a tight-knit family. The school principal was having an all-staff meeting Monday morning to discuss the murder.\nPolice are still investigating the motive behind the murders."}
