(KCRA) \u2014\nSacramento County sheriff's deputies arrested a 21-year-old in connection with a deadly shooting at a North Highlands apartment in which several other people were shot, the sheriff's department said Wednesday.\nLawrence Johnson, of Sacramento, was taken into custody Tuesday on charges of murder and a parole violation.\nInvestigators determined that Johnson fired multiple shots just before 9 p.m. on Dec. 12 through the closed door of the apartment in the 4800 block of Myrtle Avenue, deputies said.\nA little more than a week later, Sungaya Fleming, 38, died Monday at a hospital, officers said.\nA 39-year-old woman, 21-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl are recovering from their injuries.\nFleming's daughter, Tierra Sanford said she saw Johnson and a few others trying to break through the door. Her mom and cousin used their bodies to block them from getting in.\n\"Once they got the door closed, that's when Lawrence started shooting through the door,\" Sanford said.\nHer mom and cousin were both shot in the head.\n\"I feel traumatized about the situation,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cIt could have been a massacre. I just imagine if I would have opened the door. Everybody probably would be dead right now.\"\nDetectives believe a fight took place earlier in the day between Johnson and someone else who was at the apartment, which may have led to the shooting. Officers also believe there were possibly other people with Johnson when he fired at the apartment.\nIn a jail interview, Johnson said the fight earlier in the day was over an argument on Facebook, but claims he wasn't the shooter.\n\"I turned myself in trying to prove my innocence,\" Johnson said from jail.\nThere were 16 people at the apartment at the time of the shooting, and five of those children were between the ages of 4 and 16.\nSanford will now become the guardian of her 4 younger siblings. She's trying to raise money and figure out how to take care of them.\n\"I'm happy he's in jail, but my mom will never be here again,\" Sanford said.\nJohnson is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Sacramento Superior Court.\nAnyone with additional information about this shooting is asked to call the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department at 916-874-5115."}
