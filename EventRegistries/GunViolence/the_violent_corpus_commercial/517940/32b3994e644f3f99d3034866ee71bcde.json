No gun has been found by investigators.\n\u201cMy heart dropped and I found her on the ground with blood \u2026 I just picked her up, screamed and ran outside,\u201d said her mom Annique Davis.\nShe didn\u2019t want to show her face on camera and says she has post-traumatic stress. She says she hasn\u2019t been allowed to see Aubrey since she found her lying on the floor in an upstairs bedroom while visiting a friend in South Sacramento on Monday afternoon.\nREPORTER: When you put the baby in that room, did you see a gun?\nANNIQUE: I\u2019ve never seen a gun in that room ever. I never knew there was a gun in the house; if I did I wouldn\u2019t have put my daughter in that room, period.\nShe says she was in the kitchen making food. Her friend Linda was helping, and an older woman named Deborah was in another upstairs bedroom.\nREPORTER: When you went to get your baby, did you see a gun?\nANNIQUE: At the moment I didn\u2019t look to see a gun. I just thought to pick my daughter up and I didn\u2019t see anything but blood all over the place.\nBut questions remain. The gun has never surfaced, raising red flags for the Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department and Aubrey\u2019s father, DeAngelo Mansion.\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s not telling the truth and my daughter is here fighting for her life, and I\u2019m feeling the same pain she is,\u201d he said.\nMansion is no longer in a relationship with Davis, but he\u2019s angry and frustrated, feeling someone is covering up what really happened.\n\u201cWhere is the gun?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is the gun missing? If my daughter was able to pick it up then where is it?\u201d\nThe sheriff\u2019s department says there were two 911 calls made that day. One was by Davis who told the dispatcher her baby was shot. The other was by someone else in the home who said the baby shot herself.\nPlease install the latest Adobe Flash Player Plugin to watch this content.\n\u201cI\u2019m angry I\u2019m lost I don\u2019t know what to think, just seeing my daughter like that is tearing me up and I\u2019m trying to stay strong for her,\u201d he said.\nTwo parents are searching for answers while their little girl fights to stay alive.\n\u201cI want to know if someone shot her and if someone did why?\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd if she shot herself, why someone would hide a gun?\nMansion says he hasn\u2019t been able to reach Davis, and says her neglect is not surprising.\nDavis, clearly torn up, says she hasn\u2019t spoken to the other two women in the house since the incident, and has her own questions."}
