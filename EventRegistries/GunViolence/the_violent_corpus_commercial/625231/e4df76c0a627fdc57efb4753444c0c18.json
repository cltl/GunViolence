He got hit in the pancreas; they took a piece off. He got hit in the intestines; they took a piece off. He got hit in the spleen; they removed it. And bullet is lodged in his chest,\u201d said his mother, Mellanie Washington.\nTavon was on his porch in the 3900 block of West Polk Street with his mother, aunt, and 7-year-old brother when shots were fired around 10:15 p.m. Monday. A bullet struck Tavon in the back.\n\u201cHe fell down, he fell backwards on the floor, and he started beating the floor, saying, I\u2019m burning, I\u2019m burning,\u201d his mother said.\nHis twin sister, Taniyah, who was inside the home at the time, ran out on the porch to be with her brother.\n\u201cShe was down there with him, holding him, saying \u2018Twin, don\u2019t leave me. Please don\u2019t leave me.\u2019 My heart is real heavy right now,\u201d Washington said.\nTaniyah said she felt her brother\u2019s pain, even though she wasn\u2019t physically hurt. The two are best friends, and have been looking forward to starting the 5th grade in the fall. Tears rolled down her eyes as she talked about doing what she could to help him after he was shot.\n\u201cI told him to keep his eyes open, and he kept it open. He kept his eyes open, because I told him to keep it open, and if he closed it, I opened it back up,\u201d she said.\nTavon\u2019s family is praying for a full recovery. Washington said doctors have told them the road to recovery will be a long one.\nShe also pleaded with the shooter to turn himself or herself in.\n\u201cI nor my child did anything to anyone. My baby is innocent. He\u2019s only a baby. I\u2019m just sitting on my own porch, and my child gets shot like that,\u201d she said.\nArea Central detectives were investigating."}
