The four others were adults. None of the injuries was life-threatening. Police mistakenly reported late Friday that seven people had been shot.\nPolice arrested two 20-year-olds from Norfolk, Darren Lamont Roberts and Kyle Edward Thornton. They are looking for a third male they say fired shots.\nThe party started Friday at Lexington Park Apartments in the 1200 block of Tidewater Drive, off Princess Anne Road. Shortly before 11 p.m., Thornton got into a fight with another partygoer, police said.\nBoth Thornton and the other male fired at each other. Thornton was hit.\nDuring the fight, Roberts took out a gun and also began shooting, police said.\nThornton is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and discharging a firearm within an occupied dwelling. Roberts is charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a public place.\nPolice don't expect any more trouble at the apartments but will monitor the area closely, department spokesman Chris Amos said.\nAnyone with information on the third shooter is asked to call the Crime Line at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP (562-5887)."}
