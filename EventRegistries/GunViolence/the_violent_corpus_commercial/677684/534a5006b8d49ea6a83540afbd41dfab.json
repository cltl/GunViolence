The 21-year-old woman and her boyfriend were in a vehicle with a second man in the backseat. The man in the backseat discharged a firearm through the driver\u2019s seat, apparently unintentionally, striking the woman. The suspect fled the vehicle after the incident.\nThe boyfriend took the woman to Regions Hospital, where she underwent surgery. She is listed in critical but stable condition and is expected to survive.\nLinders said no arrests have been made. The suspect is described as a black man in his early 20s with a slight build and a mustache.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the location of the shooting."}
