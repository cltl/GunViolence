They plan to return Wednesday to encourage residents to talk about what they know.\n\u201cWe need to be more active. Stop hiding behind the curtains. Step out and say enough is enough, we need to stop this,\u201d said Rita Turner, who works with the Coalition.\nReverend Al Wilson from the Martha Mitchell Community Center says he knows the victim. The center is less than a block away from the shooting and feeds around 300 kids breakfast and lunch each day.\n\u201cThey come into the center all the time and it\u2019s very sad,\u201d Wilson said.\nCommunity members are already talking about ways to help stop this violence from happening again.\nDawn Sanders-Garrett, executive director of the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority, says the organization wants to \u201cprovide activities for the children, so they have positive way to work with one another and to be engaged with their local communities.\u201d\nWilson says the healing process will be hard but the community should stick together. He told News 4, \u201cIt\u2019s time to get together and pray for our community.
