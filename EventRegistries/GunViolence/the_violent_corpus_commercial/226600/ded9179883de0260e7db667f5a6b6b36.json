The boy was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead about noon.\nThe death, which police say appears to be a tragic accident, has set off a wave of grief and mourning in the tiny farming town of 3,500 that sits on the high plains about 150 miles northeast of Denver. Jaden and his family are known well in the community, according to law enforcement officials.\n\u201cPeople are pretty confused about how they are supposed to act, how they are supposed to feel,\u201d Chad Day, the Yuma County sheriff, told The Denver Post on Tuesday from the high school, where he was helping community members mourn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very common for students to leave on their lunch hour to eat somewhere else,\u201d said Day, who knew the boy and his family. \u201cIt sounds like these students were on their way to a home to grab some lunch together.\u201d\nStudents at the high school of roughly 275 were told of Jaden\u2019s death at an assembly Monday afternoon as word quickly spread throughout the school and town of the teen\u2019s death.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rough day,\u201d Day said. \u201cThey\u2019re leaning on each other.\u201d\nAn autopsy was conducted Tuesday morning. The results have not been released.\n\u201cThis town lost one of the best kids ever,\u201d wrote Dawson Grietsch, a friend, on Facebook. \u201cLosing my buddy is the toughest thing I\u2019ve ever (gone) through. I have memories I will never forget.\u201d\nWhile some forensic evidence is still being processed, officials are confident the shooting was accidental. The Yuma Police Department is leading the investigation into Jaden\u2019s death.\nAuthorities said the firearm that killed Jaden, who played baseball at the high school, was a bird hunting shotgun. Those in the vehicle at the time of the shooting are not considered suspects.\nCounseling services are being offered to the school\u2019s students and staff members, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\nCommunity members gathered Monday night for a candlelight vigil to remember the teen. Jaden\u2019s death also sparked an outpouring on social media of condolences and support for his family.\n\u201cJaden Rahm was a genuinely sweet kid, who will be greatly missed,\u201d Eric Metcalfe posted on Twitter. \u201cPlease send prayers for the Rahm family.\u201d\nJaden\u2019s Facebook page was filled Tuesday with photos and memories from family, friends and friends of friends. Many changed their profile pictures on Face book and Twitter to a black box with Jaden\u2019s initials, \u201cJR.\u201d\nJaden\u2019s family declined through law enforcement to comment on the shooting and asked for privacy.\n\u201cI\u2019ll always remember you,\u201d one girl wrote.\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul"}
