They knocked on the door and announced \u201csheriff\u2019s department\u201d.\n\u201cImmediately shots fired from inside the house towards the deputies and deputies returned gunfire,\u201d said Bullock. \u201cA standoff with numerous deputies took place. Everybody was going to a fundraiser for Deputy Tim Harris when all this occurred, so 10 or 12 of us ended up at the address instead of going to the fundraiser.\u201d\nBullock said they secured the residence from outside and evacuated the area. He said they eventually made phone contact with the suspect.\n\u201cHe would not come out of the house and the phone conversation went on for several hours,\u201d said Bullock. \u201cWe called in the Farmington City SWAT team in case we had to go in. Eventually the deputy talked the suspect into coming out and giving himself up.\u201d\nBullock said they had been after Winston throughout the day Friday and they sent the extra deputies to cover both sides of the door so he wouldn\u2019t run out of the house. The standoff began at about 6 p.m.\n\u201cWe finally took him into custody at 9:20 p.m.,\u201d said Bullock. \u201cIt was one my deputies that did all of the negotiating. He built a rapport with the guy inside the house. One deputy was injured. A bullet came through the wall and hit him in the leg, but it did not penetrate him, it just bruised him.\u201d\nBullock said at that point they called in Missouri State Highway Patrol to take over the investigation because an officer fired their weapon.\n\u201cThe patrol will handle the actual investigation of the shooting to show there is no impropriety,\u201d said Bullock. \u201cWe are in the process of obtaining a search warrant for the apartment, but they may have it by now.\u201d\nBullock said Winston has a bond of $250,000 for the warrant they were trying to serve, but they also plan to file charges against him with the state prosecutor\u2019s office.\nWinston has a history of charges including three class C felonies of endangering the welfare of a child, distribute, deliver, manufacture, produce or possess with the intent to distribute, deliver, manufacture, produce a controlled substance, and assault in the third degree.\n9:35 p.m. Update: It has been reported the suspect is in custody. We will have more details as information is made available.\nOriginal story: An individual has barricaded himself in an apartment off Corcoran Road just outside of Doe Run after firing several shots at law enforcement while they were trying to serve a felony warrant Friday evening."}
