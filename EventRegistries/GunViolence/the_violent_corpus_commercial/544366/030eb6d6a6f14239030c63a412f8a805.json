His wife was struck by the same bullet in the arm.\nAccording to Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Office reports, Robert T. Edwards, 41, was pronounced dead at Morgan Memorial Hospital after a single gunshot from a Taurus 9mm pistol struck him in the head. Reports state that his wife, Jamie Renee Edwards, 48, was struck in her right bicep with a \u201cthrough and through\u201d wound. Morgan County Sheriff Robert Markley said the bullet came to rest in the wall of the bedroom of the couple\u2019s Aqua Road residence. Capt. Chris Bish, Investigations Division, Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said investigators are treating the shooting as \u201ca death investigation.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to determine if it was accidental or intentional.\u201d\nThe shooting occurred, reports state, at approximately 12:45 a.m. on Saturday, February 6. Bish said the couple and other family members had been at a Madison restaurant earlier in the evening and on the way home Robert Edwards stopped to aid a stranded motorist at the BP gas station on Highway 83. Later that night, Bish said, the couple began to argue and the argument became physical. He said both had consumed alcohol. An autopsy was completed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab on Monday, Bish said, and preliminary results show that the fatal shot \u201cappears to be self\u2013inflicted.\u201d Bish said the \u201cseries of disputes that led up to the shooting\u201d were on\u2013going. The dispute at some point turned physical, Bish said, and investigators believe Jamie Edwards \u201cmay have had her arm wrapped around his head,\u201d when the shot was fired. Jamie Edwards was treated at Morgan Memorial and released. Bish said Robert Edwards was killed with a pistol that belonged to his wife and investigators are attempting to try and understand why he had her pistol and her holster. \u201cIt appears it was the wife\u2019s weapon,\u201d Bish said. \u201cHe had her weapon on his right hip.\u201d"}
