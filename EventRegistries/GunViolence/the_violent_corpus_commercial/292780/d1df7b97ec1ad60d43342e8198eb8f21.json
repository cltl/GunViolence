Fresno police Lt. Joe Gomez said officers found an 8-year-old girl with a gunshot wound to her torso. She was talking and in stable condition Friday afternoon at Community Regional Medical Center.\nGomez said preliminary findings are that the girls\u2019 father was getting ready for work and put his handgun on the bed in his bedroom while he was in the bathroom. The magazine was removed from the weapon, but there was a round in the chamber. The 10-year-old grabbed the gun, \u201cmanipulated it\u201d and one round discharged, hitting the younger girl in the lower torso. Gomez said the lieutenant immediately called 911 for an ambulance and also notified Fresno police, who sped to the home.\nHe said it would be up to the Fresno County District Attorney\u2019s Office to determine whether the lieutenant would face legal consequences, but added \u201cwe absolutely support him in this very difficult time \u2014 and his family \u2014 and what they are going through right now.\u201d\nGomez said the findings of the investigation would likely be submitted to the DA\u2019s office within the week.\nLt. Bill Ward of the Madera County Sheriff\u2019s Office said the incident would be treated as a confidential personnel matter.\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by this tragic event,\u201d he said. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with the family.\u201d\nThe lieutenant and his family have been offered support services available outside the sheriff\u2019s office.\nAt a 5 p.m. news conference, Madera County Sheriff Jay Varney said the gun used was the employee\u2019s service weapon but that the employee \u2014 whose name was not provided \u2014 would not be placed on paid administrative leave.\n\u201cI\u2019ve considered the circumstance of what\u2019s happened here and since he wasn\u2019t directly involved with the discharge of the firearm \u2014 no, I will not be putting him on administrative leave.\u201d\nVarney wouldn\u2019t describe the shooting because it remains under investigation, but said, \u201cthe gun was only left unattended for a short time.\u201d\nVarney said the employee is cooperating with the Fresno police criminal investigation. Following that, Varney said the Madera County Sheriff\u2019s Office will conduct an internal administrative investigation to determine if any of the department\u2019s policies were violated.\nVarney didn\u2019t discuss those policies during the news conference, instead paraphrasing state law: \u201cIf you are going to store your firearm within your home with the ammunition, it has to be outside of the access of anyone under 18.\u201d\nVarney issued a warning to other gun owners: \u201cIf you have a loaded firearm within your household, it takes a fraction of a second for something to go wrong.\u201d\nHe said free gun locks are available by calling the Madera County Sheriff\u2019s Office or any of its partner agencies, which also provide them to residents for free."}
