(Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun video)\nA 10-year-old boy was walking into an East Baltimore dollar store Friday evening when police said he was shot in the arm.\n\"Somebody was randomly firing,\" Police Col. Stanley Brandford said.\nThe shooting occurred around 6:30 p.m. Police wrapped yellow crime tape around the entrance to the Family Dollar store at 5330 Frankford Ave.\nThe boy was walking into the store with his brother, who wasn't hit, while their mother waited in the car.\nCity Councilman Brandon Scott arrived at the scene shortly afterward.\n\"It's unacceptable,\" he said, \"if you're a grown man and you shoot a young kid.\"\nScott's district includes the strip mall with the dollar store.\n\"This is a 10-year-old that has nothing to do with whatever ridiculous conflict you're involved in,\" Scott said.\nThe bullet was still lodged in the boy's arm an hour later at Johns Hopkins Hospital.\nHis family had gathered and his mother walked out from the room where her son was being treated. He was going to be fine, said his mother, who declined to give her name. He was going to the store to buy juice, she said."}
