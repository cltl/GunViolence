(WBTV) \u2013 A Caldwell County teenager is dead after family members say he was showing off a pistol on video chat and the gun went off. Investigators are calling the incident an \u201caccidental shooting.\u201d\nSixteen-year-old Dekota Smith was at his home along Baton Church Road Sunday night, according to his family, showing the pistol to a friend. The friend told family members they could see Smith\u2019s face on the screen, then all of a sudden they could only see the ceiling.\nAccording to his uncle, Greg Johnston, Smith\u2019s family was out of town when the incident happened. His grandparents, who live in the home, were upstairs when the shot rang out, but didn\u2019t know it came from inside the house.\nDekota\u2019s friend called several people to go check on him and they found the teenager with a gunshot wound to the head.\n\u201cThere was nothing anyone could do,\u201d said Johnston.\nInvestigators say they are looking for additional information, including who owned the gun. Smith\u2019s uncle says it was left behind when someone in the house moved out. He says the family didn\u2019t know it was there.\nHe says Dekota was a \u201cgood kid\u201d and a that lot of people will miss him.\nDekota was a sophomore at South Caldwell High School, where extra counselors, clergy and others came to comfort the students. According to a school spokesperson, he was involved in the school\u2019s wrestling team, track and ROTC.\n\u201cHe was well-loved and he was well-respected on this campus,\u201d said spokesperson Libby Brown.\nOfficials say this is a reminder about safety and securing guns inside the home. Sheriff Alan Jones says if you can\u2019t afford a lock for your gun, the Sheriff\u2019s Office will try and get them for you.\nCary's mayor strongly hinted in a blog post that a \"blue and yellow\"\u2026\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
