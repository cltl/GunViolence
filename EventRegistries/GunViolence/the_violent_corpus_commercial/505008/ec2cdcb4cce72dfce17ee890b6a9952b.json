He has not been arraigned on the charge.\nKayla Babick, 24, died from a single gunshot wound on Feb. 14 after Battle Creek police said she apparently laid on a handgun that was on her bed. The gun fired when she reached behind her to move it.\nBabick was on the phone with her mother when the gun fired and Gaines was also on the bed looking at Facebook on his cell phone, police said.\nBabick reached behind her and apparently held the gun in a way that deactivated the grip safety and touched the trigger. After the shooting, she was able to walk downstairs but then collapsed.\nDetective Scott Silverman said in April he didn't believe Gaines fired the shot and that the shooting was accidental. Police have said Gaines was cooperative and passed a polygraph test.\nGilbert declined to discuss specific evidence in the case but said the charge was issued because Gaines was the owner of the handgun and it was his duty to maintain control of the weapon.\n\"If it is his gun, he is responsible for the gun,\" Gilbert said.\nContact Trace Christenson at 269-966-0685 or tchrist@battlecreekenquirer.com.
