Javier Salazar said.\nPolice were called to an apartment complex at Hamilton and Ceralvo about 11:30 this morning on a report of a shooting. When they arrived, they say the boy was already dead from a gunshot wound to the head.\n\"The suspect pointed the gun at the victim's head and pulled the trigger,\" he said. We are trying to determine what the suspect's intent was, and if he knew the gun was loaded.\"\nNo word on what charges the 18 year old might face."}
