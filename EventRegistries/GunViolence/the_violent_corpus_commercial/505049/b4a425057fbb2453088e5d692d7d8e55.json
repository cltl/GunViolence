Brown, who died this month after walking into a hospital with a gunshot wound.\nJohn E. Nash was charged Saturday with homicide by negligent handling of a dangerous weapon. His bail was set at $10,000, and he is due back in court March 1 for a preliminary hearing.\nBrown, 44, was shot about 7:15 p.m. Feb. 13 in the 3000 block of W. Wisconsin Ave., according to Milwaukee police.\nNash and another man were drinking beer and vodka-cranberry cocktails at a friend's house near N. 22nd and W. Townsend streets with Brown, the criminal complaint says.\nThe man later told police Nash was armed with a gun, which had malfunctioned in the past, according to the complaint.\nThe three men decided to purchase food at El Rey, and Brown drove because he had not been drinking. Nash was sitting in the back seat of the car when his gun fired, the complaint says. Brown was shot in the side and drove to Aurora Sinai Medical Center, where he walked in for treatment.\nPolice officials say because Brown's death was ruled negligent, it will not be included in the city's homicide total reported to the federal government, which follows the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting guidelines.\nAs of Monday, nine homicides following those guidelines have been recorded in the city this year, according to records maintained by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. That total does not include two killings that authorities ruled were self-defense, nor the negligent homicide of Brown."}
