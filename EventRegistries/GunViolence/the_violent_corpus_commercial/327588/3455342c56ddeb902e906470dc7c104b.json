She is in stable condition and expected to recover.\nThe victim initially told police that she had been shot in the street near Crescent Avenue and Chester Place by a stranger. Police investigated, however, and found that no one witnessed a shooting in that area.\n\"The story just didn't add up,\" said Detective Lt. Patrick McCormack.\nAfter further questioning, he said, the teen told police that she and her friend were playing with a gun inside an apartment at 82 Chester Place when the gun went off.\nPolice found blood in the apartment but have not located the weapon.\nThe friend, Omaiah Thompson, is now facing felony charges of assault and weapon possession. She is awaiting arraignment.\nThe victim will likely be charged with filing a false report, McCormack said.\nMcCormack reminded residents that they can anonymously call police to report an illegal gun. They are given a code number and if the gun is recovered, they will receive $500 cash. The number is 914-377-4867."}
