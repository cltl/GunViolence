Deonta Jackson, the boy\u2019s uncle, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the child was visiting family at the complex and they were in the parking lot when shots rang out nearby.\nDekalb police said the child was riding a Big Wheel when he was hit.\n\u201cI pulled him into the truck,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cbut by the time I pulled him in the truck it was too late (to protect him).\u201d\nIt was unclear how many times the boy was shot. DeKalb police Maj. Antonio Catlin said, as of about 7:30 p.m., the boy was in stable condition.\nCatlin said the incident began around 4:40 p.m., when an unknown individual fired multiple shots at two men in the area. The motive for the shooting was unclear, but Catlin said authorities were speaking with the men who were shot at.\nNo arrests had been made.\nFour Georgia children have been killed in accidental shootings since Oct. 17, with the most recent coming a week ago. That\u2019s when Atlanta police believe 6-year-old Ja\u2019Mecca Smith found a loaded handgun tucked between couch cushions inside her family\u2019s apartment and shot herself.\nHer father, Demarqo Smith, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct.\nThe other three incidents were in Paulding, Butts and Cobb counties.\nThe apartment complex where Saturday\u2019s shooting occurred was also the scene of the death of Troy Lee Robinson, who died Aug. 6 after being Tasered while fleeing police officers."}
