John Walker said.\nIt was around 9 p.m. that night when the men drove to the street and opened fire at least once with the shotgun and then fired several times with a handgun, police said.\nThe gunfire injured 11 people, eight from the same family, with the youngest victim being a 1-year-old girl. Two boys, an 11- and 12-year-old, were also struck. Police discovered the 11th victim over the course of their investigation.\n\"It's a blessing though that they made it, seriously,\" Tyrone Jones, who helped organize the party, told NBC10 this week.\nThe victims have all been released from the hospital, but some are continuing to be treated because they have shotgun pellets embedded in their bodies that cannot be removed without inflicting more damage, according to the lieutenant.\nWalker said Harley and Lamar were looking for a person in that area and appeared to open fire randomly. Both have a criminal background and will face several charges when arrested including attempted murder and aggravated assault.\nAnyone with information is asked to call Philadelphia Police's tip line at 215.686.TIPS."}
