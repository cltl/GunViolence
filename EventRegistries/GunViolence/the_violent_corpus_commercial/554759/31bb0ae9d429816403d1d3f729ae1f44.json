Too often, there are guns involved.\nThe Minneapolis Police Department calculates that there have been 131 people wounded or killed by gunshots in the city so far this year. Eighty percent of those \u2014 105 victims \u2014 were shot in the Fourth Precinct on the North Side. The next largest percentage was in the Third Precinct in south Minneapolis, with 9 percent.\nTen-year-old Jon\u2019tayasia Dillon-White, who lives with her mom and four brothers on Plymouth, between James and Knox avenues N., was one of the North Side victims.\nIt was 10:20 p.m. on May 5, a Thursday night. She and her 11-year-old brother were in bed watching TV when a stray bullet came through the second-floor bedroom wall, pierced her right foot from sole to instep, and disappeared into the back wall of her closet.\nHer mom, Tequila Dillon, who works long hours at a restaurant in Eden Prairie, had been home about 20 minutes and was running the water in the bathroom next door, getting ready to take a shower.\nShe didn\u2019t hear the gunshots. But she heard her youngest scream.\n\u201cShe been shot, y\u2019all, she been shot!\u201d Tequila Dillon recalled Tuesday.\nDillon, 31, sat on the front stoop of her home, describing what it\u2019s like to live in the violence-plagued area. Her five kids popped their heads in and out of the front door.\n\u201cCan I wash your car?\u201d the 11-year-old asked.\n\u201cNo, leave it alone. Go in the house,\u201d Dillon told him.\nJon\u2019tayasia brought her a small plastic container planted with weeds and flowers.\n\u201cFor your birthday,\u201d the girl said.\n\u201cOh, how pretty,\u201d Dillon replied.\nTheir home is just a few yards from where Jamar Clark was killed by police officers during a confrontation last November, prompting weeks of protest in the area.\nDillon and the kids hear gunshots at least three times a week. Jon\u2019tayasia was one of three people shot that night on the North Side, according to news reports.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a never-ending battle over here,\u201d she said. \u201cDrugs, drug dealing, gambling, disrespectful men that don\u2019t want to get off my block. You gotta worry about bullets being fired. You never know when it\u2019s going to happen; it just happens.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t live over here. Why bring your drama over here? Take the drama somewhere else. We\u2019re tired of it,\u201d she said.\nDillon worries about keeping her sons \u2014 particularly her 14-year-old twins \u2014 off the streets.\n\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s a hard battle,\u201d said Dillon, who speaks with the passion of a community organizer. \u201cThey don\u2019t really try to be part of that lifestyle, \u2019cause they know mama ain\u2019t havin\u2019 it. Just because we live here don\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to be a product of their environment.\u201d\nDillon wants out, though. She\u2019s tired of tackling the problem all on her own, she said.\n\u201cNo matter how much you try to fight it, try to tell them to take it somewhere else, it\u2019s never going to take just one person to stand up,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a whole block to stand up and say we\u2019re tired of this \u2026 we want our block back, we want our kids to be able to play.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of doing it myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI get reckless. I sit out there with a bat. Get the [expletive] off my block. I\u2019m not playing no more.\u201d\nAlthough there were numerous people around the night Jon\u2019tayasia was shot, nobody has stepped forward to help police.\n\u201cThis area is really rocked with violence that needs to stop,\u201d said police spokesman John Elder. \u201cWe need to get this solved. Her daughter needs to feel safe.\u201d\nPolice said they\u2019ve sent extra patrols in to high-crime areas like Dillon\u2019s neighborhood. For the week of May 3-9, in the Fourth Precinct, foot patrols were up 108 percent over last year, and hot-spot patrols were up 84 percent. Still, that week, ShotSpotter was activated in the precinct 118 times, with 10 reports of shots fired.\nCrimeStoppers is offering a reward (of an amount to be determined later) for information leading to an arrest and conviction in Jon\u2019tayasia\u2019s shooting. Tips can be called in to 1-800-222-8477 or texted to 274637. The incident number is 16-160009.\nA month after the shooting, Jon\u2019tayasia is up and running around. But her foot isn\u2019t healing as well as doctors would like, and she may need surgery. Dillon and her family rarely venture upstairs anymore except to shower. All six sleep in the first-floor living room, hoping the brick facing on the townhouse might protect them from any more bullets.\nAnd she tells her kids about karma.\n\u201cIf you do something out on the streets, it\u2019s going to come back on you,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything you do, there\u2019s a cause and there\u2019s an effect. My older boys, they\u2019re mad, they\u2019re thinking that whoever did this, they want to get him back. But like I told them, at the end of the day, you don\u2019t have to do nothing, because the same way somebody did something to her is the same way somebody is going to do something to them.\u201d\nTuesday was a rare day off for Dillon, and the large extended family was at her house, preparing a barbecue to celebrate her twins\u2019 graduation from middle school.\nDillon said people at her workplace helped her set up a GoFundMe page, hoping to make enough money so she can move her family out of the neighborhood.
