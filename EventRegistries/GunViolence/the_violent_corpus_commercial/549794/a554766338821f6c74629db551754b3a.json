According to the police report, Dikowski told police the night before the shooting, he went to check his mail using the flashlight mounted on his 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun.\n\u201cI wouldn't guess that is not standard protocol throughout Gladwin County,\u201d said Sheriff Mike Shea.\nShea says when Dikowski went back into the home, he placed the gun under a couch, thinking his son wouldn't be able to find the weapon. Dikowski told investigators he does have a gun safe where the handgun is usually kept.\n\u201cThe idea that you can actually put it somewhere loaded, where it\u2019s safe, not when there is a child in the house, there is no place safe,\u201d Shea said.\nThe next day, Dikowski fell asleep watching cartoons with his son. A loud pop woke him up and he noticed his son's left arm had a bullet wound and immediately drove him to the hospital.\nDikowski wouldn't comment on the charges, but says his son is doing fine.\nShea says anyone purchasing a firearm should look into buying gun safety products, like safes and trigger locks. Before bringing a gun into a home, they should think about three things.\n\u201cSafety, safety, safety,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThere is a lot of different things out there on the market that can keep these weapons safe, especially when it comes to younger children.\u201d\nDikowski is free on a $2,500 bond and his bond conditions state he cannot have any firearms in the house while he cares for his son."}
