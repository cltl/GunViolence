The child was rushed to Barton Memorial Hospital.\nThe boy fired the gun just before his grandmother made it back to the car and shot himself in the hand. Although severely hurt, the gunshot wound is not life-threatening.\nThe boy\u2019s grandfather is a California law enforcement officer from out of the area, and is lawfully authorized to carry a loaded gun in his car. The child\u2019s grandfather\u2019s gun was in his closed glove box, which did not have a lock. The man was waiting with his grandson in the parking lot while his wife went into Staples.\nThe boy was sitting in the backseat of the car. The grandfather got out to walk their dog just outside of the parked car. While he was standing behind the car, the child got into the front seat and pulled the gun out of the glove box without his grandfather noticing.\nOfficers secured the weapon as evidence and are submitting their investigation to the El Dorado County District Attorney\u2019s Office for review and disposition concerning the possible filing of criminal charges for child endangerment. To help protect the identity of this special-needs child, neither his name, nor the names of his hrandparents, will be released by SLTPD at this time.\nGreg Cotta filed this report."}
