In addition to the Sheriff\u2019s Department, officers from Munster, Hammond, Schererville, Griffith and Michigan City are part of the Region contingent.\nProtesters trying to stop construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline were bracing for a confrontation with police Thursday after the demonstrators refused to leave private land in the pipeline\u2019s path, The Associated Press reported.\nA months-long dispute over the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline reached a crisis point when some 200 protesters set up camp on land owned by pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners. The disputed area is just to the north of a more permanent and larger encampment on federally owned land where hundreds of protesters have camped for months.\nLaw enforcement officials demanded that the protesters leave the private land on Wednesday, but the protesters refused.\nNorthwest Indiana officers from the Indiana Department of Homeland Security District 1 Task Force were deployed Saturday and will remain there for about two weeks under the contract, said Munster Police Chief Steve Scheckel, also the state\u2019s Homeland Security liaison.\nNorth Dakota will be responsible for reimbursing out-of-state police agencies for various costs, said John Erickson, spokesman for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security. Such costs include wages, overtime, officer benefits, meals while officers are on duty, a per diem while officers are off duty, lodging and mileage for the communities that sent vehicles.\n* Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct the date of the accidental shooting.
