He was told the juvenile was taken to the hospital by private vehicle.\n(A gun safety brochure from the state Department of Insurance is included as a PDF attachment at the end of the story)\nMembers of B Squad secured the residence and interviewed witnesses. Investigator Chris Babb was called to continue the investigation and spoke with the juvenile and the child\u2019s mother at the hospital.\nInitial witness statements indicate the gun went off when it was knocked over and fell to the floor. Police are trying to determine the circumstances of the matter.\nHasty said investigation is ongoing to determine whether charges will be filed as well as whether the weapon was properly stored.\nHasty in the statement also included tips from Project Child Safe and the National Shooting Sports Foundation.\nThey are as follows:\n\u2022 Always keep the firearm\u2019s muzzle pointed in a safe direction. A \u201csafe direction\u201d means that the gun is pointed so that even if an accidental discharge occurred, it would not result in injury.\n\u2022 Always keep your finger off the trigger until you actually intend to shoot. When handling a gun, rest your finger outside the trigger guard or along the side of the gun. Don\u2019t touch the trigger until you are actually ready to fire.\n\u2022 Firearms should be unloaded when not actually in use. Whenever you pick up a gun, such as when removing it from or returning it to storage, remember to point it in a safe direction and make sure it is unloaded.\n\u2022 Be sure you know how your firearm operates: read the manual on your firearm, know how to safely open and close the action of the firearm and know how to safely remove any ammunition from the firearm and its magazine.\n\u2022 Store your firearms in a locked cabinet, safe, gun vault or storage case when not in use, ensuring they are in a location inaccessible by children and cannot be handled by anyone without your permission.\n\u2022 Store your ammunition in a locked location separate from firearms.\n\u2022 Use a gun locking device that renders the firearm inoperable when not in use. A gun lock should be used as an additional safety precaution and not as a substitute for secure storage.\n\u2022 Make sure young people in your home are aware of and understand the safety guidelines concerning firearms. Have them sign the Project Child Safe Pledge for young people\u2014a reminder that if they find an unattended firearm in their home or a neighbor\u2019s to not touch it, and tell an adult.\n\u2022 Always unload, clean and place your firearms in their secure storage location immediately after returning from a hunting trip or a day at the range.\n\u2022 Educate everyone in your family about firearms safety.
