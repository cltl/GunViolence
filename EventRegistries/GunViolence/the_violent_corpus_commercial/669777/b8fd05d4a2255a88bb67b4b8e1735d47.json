The photo has been removed.\nNew Orleans Police are asking for the public's help in locating a man they're describing as a \"person of interest\" who may have information related to the Oct. 4 Mid-City shooting that killed three people and wounded two others.\nPolice say the man is not a suspect in the slayings, but homicide detectives want to speak with him about information he may have. Police did not release the man's name, but they provided a photo.\nIt's the second group shooting in the city in just over three weeks.\nThe three victims have been identified as two men and a woman: Darome Hilton, 34, Glenquel Emerson, 20, and Bobbie Basquine, 22. Witnesses said there were two cars that left the scene quickly after the shootings.\nAnyone with information about the man's whereabouts should call Detective Robert Bachelder or New Orleans Police Department's homicide unit at 504-658-5324 or 504-658-5300.\nFive people were shot dead in New Orleans and one in Metairie the week that ended Sunday (Oct. 23)."}
