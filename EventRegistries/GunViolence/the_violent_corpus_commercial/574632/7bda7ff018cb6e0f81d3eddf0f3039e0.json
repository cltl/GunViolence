In a brief hearing before Referee Nicholas Bobak, he received a $50,000, 10 percent bond, despite a request by his defense attorney to be allowed to go home.\nBobak said given \u201cvery serious allegations\u201d against the teen, his family would need to post at least $5,000 cash to bring him home while he awaits his pre-trial hearing scheduled for June 22.\nThe teen on Wednesday waived the formal reading of the charges against him as well as his probable cause conference. These are his first alleged offenses in the Wayne County juvenile system.\nWhen Bobak asked his mother in court if the child listened to her instructions at home, she replied, \u201cHe\u2019s hardheaded.\u201d\nThe mother left the brief hearing Wednesday without making any comments about what happened.\nIf released, the teen must have no contact with witnesses or the victim\u2019s family. He also is to follow a curfew.\nThe teen tested positive for marijuana after his arrest, according to the court. Bobak admonished the boy to \u201cstay away from marijuana\u201d if released from detention.\nIf convicted of the charges against him, the teen will be sentenced under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\nPolice late Tuesday questioned and detained the teen, who is a seventh-grader and football player at Marquette Middle School.\nIt was not immediately clear who owns the gun used in the shooting, according to Detroit Police Officer Dan Donakowski.\nThe youths may have been involved in an earlier dispute, Police Chief James Craig told Fox 2 Detroit. Authorities also were probing the possibility that they were playing, Donakowski said.\nThe incident is the latest round of violence involving children in Detroit.\nSince Easter, at least eight youths ages 15 and under have been injured or killed by gunfire, sparking outcry from police and residents.\nLast week, the body of Deontae Mitchell, 13, was found in an east-side field, days after he\u2019d been taken at gunpoint outside a store. An autopsy has been completed but the manner and cause of death remain pending.\nHFournier@detroitnews.com\n(313) 223-4616\n@HollyPFournier\nStaff Writer Mark Hicks contributed."}
