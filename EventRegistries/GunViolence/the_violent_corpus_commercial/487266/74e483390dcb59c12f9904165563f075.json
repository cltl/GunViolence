We know we\u2019ll see uniforms\u2026visible uniforms\u2026in those neighborhoods, but in those areas where its covert, you may not necessarily see them, but it\u2019s there.\u201d\nRiggs said a group of potential offenders and victims will get special attention from IMPD.\n\u201cWe have five thousand individuals coming back to this community every year from prison,\u201d said Riggs. \u201cFive thousand. 1500 of these five thousand have never lived in this city before.\u201d\nHite said officers are working closer with the Department of Corrections and the Marion County Probation Department to identify those people.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified targets over the year. Some have come back from prison. Some have been lingering for decades. Some families have been operating in this town for a very long time with impunity. We\u2019re just sending a message in a strong way that\u2019s not going to happen much longer.\u201d\nPolice commanders have also encouraged beat officers to emphasize legitimate traffic stops in the search for potential warrant violators and suspected felons.\nOn the city\u2019s northwest district, of approximately 30,000 traffic stops in the last year, one in 11 contacts led to arrests on traffic or other charges, though officers have the option to issue warnings instead.\nMany of the stops result in arrests for weapons, probation violations or outstanding warrants."}
