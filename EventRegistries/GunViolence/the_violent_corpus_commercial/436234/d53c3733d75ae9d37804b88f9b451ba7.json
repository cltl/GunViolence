Three other victims were injured but sustained non-life-threatening injuries.\nOne victim was taken to a nearby residence, which is now part of the investigation in addition to other vehicles possibly hit in the shooting, according to Crump. Ultimately, all of the victims were taken to three local hospitals.\nOne weapon was recovered at the scene, and Phoenix police have also detained two people as investigative leads.\n\"We are questioning them at this point to determine what their involvement in this was,\" Crump said.\nAs investigators continued to piece together clues Sunday morning, family members and friends began to visit the property attempting to do the same.\nEarlier reports of the shooting taking place near St. Luke's Medical Center were incorrect."}
