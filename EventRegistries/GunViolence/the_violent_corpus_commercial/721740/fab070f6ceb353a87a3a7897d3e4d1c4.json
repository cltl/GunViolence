We didn\u2019t hear about it until the victim\u2019s father contacted us last night. There was no \u201cassault with weapons\u201d medical callout because friends drove the victim to the hospital. The police report we obtained today says that several people called 911 to report suspected gunfire; police found no victim, no shell casings, no blood. Then, about half an hour later, the investigating officer found out that a person with a shoulder wound had shown up at Harborview Medical Center, saying he had been shot at a party in West Seattle. The person whose house was the scene of the party told SPD he didn\u2019t know anything about a shooting. The officer looked a second time and still found no physical evidence of a shooting in the area.\nThe victim\u2019s father tells WSB that his son is believed to have been shot by someone who pulled up in a vehicle outside the party, opened fire, and left. No description information. The Gang Unit is following up, according to both the police report and the victim\u2019s father, who says his son is not involved with gangs but the shooter is believed to be. If you have any information about the shooting, contact SPD and refer to case 2016-435767. (Anonymous tips can be sent this way.)"}
