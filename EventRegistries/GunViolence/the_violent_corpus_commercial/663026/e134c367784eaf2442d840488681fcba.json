We believe they are preventable tragedies,\" said Beth Joslin Roth of Safe Tennessee Project.\nRoth is working to bring awareness to this type of gun violence.\nOn Sunday night at Exit-In in Nashville she put together a concert series, one of many taking place nationwide.\n\"There are concerts happening all the way from Maine to Hawaii in 350 venues across the nation,\" said Roth.\nAll of the concerts are to raise awareness and help people to get involved in gun violence prevention.\nIn this weekend's shooting, police said the gun owner was legally allowed to have her firearm in her car.\nHowever, she does not have a carry permit.\nAs of Sunday night no charges have been filed in this case.\nCopyright 2016 WSMV (Meredith Corporation).
