Cruz Hernandez, said the mother of the child left the house to run an errand and when she returned she found her son with a gun shot wound and called police.\nHernandez said not many details can be released because it is an ongoing investigation.\nThe child's name can't be released because he is a minor.\nPolice are still investigating whether a crime occurred or if it was self-inflicted or accidental. They are also waiting on a preliminary report from the Dallas County Medical Examiners office.\nCheck back for updates as they become available."}
