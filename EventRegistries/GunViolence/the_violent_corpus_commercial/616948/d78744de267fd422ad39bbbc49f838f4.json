On Sunday, a court commissioner had also found probable cause to hold Ivanov on the same allegations.\nHoward ordered Ivanov \u2014 who appeared via video feed from the Snohomish County Jail \u2014 to be held without bail.\nProsecutors are expected to formally charge Ivanov on Tuesday or Wednesday, Deputy Prosecutor Adam Cornell said.\nKilled were Ivanov\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Anna Bui, Jake Long and Jordan Ebner, all 19. Will Kramer, 18, was wounded and was in serious condition Monday in the intensive-care unit at Harborview Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said.\nAlso Monday, a vigil was held for Bui at the University of Washington\u2019s Bothell campus, where she and Ivanov were students. Recently returned from a monthlong trip to Europe, Bui was remembered as a \u201cbright light\u201d who was considering a career in medicine.\nThe mass shooting has rocked a tight-knit group of friends who attended Mukilteo\u2019s Kamiak High School.\nSultan Akbar, 18, had classes with Ivanov and the victims. He wasn\u2019t at the party where the shootings happened, but showed up at court with three friends Monday to express support for the victims\u2019 families.\n\u201cI just feel shook up,\u201d Akbar said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked \u2026 those guys aren\u2019t here anymore.\u201d\nHe was friends with Ivanov, who he said seemed to have an explosive temper, once threatening to get Akbar kicked out of school after Akbar reported to a teacher that Ivanov had copied his work.\n\u201cHe was always wanting to be in control of the situation\u201d and at times displayed \u201cillogical anger,\u201d Akbar said.\nSeattle defense attorneys Tim Leary and Zach Wagnild were retained by Ivanov\u2019s parents over the weekend and said the couple are devastated for the victims\u2019 families as well as their own. Ivanov\u2019s mother told them Bui \u201cwas essentially like a daughter to them,\u201d Wagnild said.\nLeary said he was troubled that Ivanov was able to buy an assault-style rifle but was too young to buy a six-pack of beer. He underscored the police contention that Ivanov read the weapon\u2019s instruction manual just before the shooting.\n\u201cI think it speaks volumes to his youth and inexperience and highlights the lethality of the weapon involved,\u201d Leary said.\nMukilteo police say Ivanov told detectives he broke up with Bui two months ago but then decided he wanted her back, according to the affidavit. He told police he began spending time with Bui last week.\nAfter his arrest, \u201cIvanov stated that everything that went on tonight was about a girl,\u201d police wrote in the affidavit.\nIvanov became jealous after he said he saw photos of Bui on Snapchat with other young men \u2014 evidence \u201cshe was getting on with her life without him,\u201d the document says. He told police he realized she was his \u201cdream girl,\u201d \u201cand wanted to get back together,\u201d the affidavit says.\nIvanov said he became angry when he heard from others that Bui \u201cwas seeing other guys while the two of them were talking and that made him angry,\u201d police wrote.\nThe affidavit says Ivanov claimed he purchased the Ruger AR-15 rifle about a week ago, intent on using it for target practice. He signed up for a firearms-safety class, which was to begin early this month.\nHe told police he viewed \u201cthe rifle as a symbol of power,\u201d the affidavit said.\nOn Friday night, Ivanov left work early because he \u201cwasn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d then went to the Cabela\u2019s store in Marysville to buy a second magazine for the rifle because he had been told he would need it for the firearms class, the affidavit says.\nIvanov told police he arrived at the party in the 10000 block of 64th Place West at 10 p.m. Friday but parked across the street and watched the house, the affidavit says. He crept up toward the house, looked inside and saw Bui \u201cwith another male and got angry,\u201d it says.\nIvanov then returned to his car, where he read the owner\u2019s manual for the rifle, loaded the magazine and inserted it into the AR-15, the affidavit says.\nAround midnight, he crept to the back of the house, hiding \u201calong the west wall near the living room windows,\u201d it says. He was discovered by a male partygoer, who said, \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d before Ivanov opened fire, shooting the male, according to the affidavit.\nIvanov told police \u201cit was too late to turn back, and once he had pulled the trigger, his adrenaline kicked in.\u201d He entered the house through a side door, found Bui and shot her twice, it says. He continued through the house, then shot another male \u201crunning toward the house,\u201d police wrote.\nIvanov went upstairs and onto the balcony off the master bedroom and fired at two more males in the driveway, police wrote. \u201cHe then went up on the roof and realized his magazine was empty,\u201d so returned to his car and drove away. He was arrested about 90 minutes later on Interstate 5 near Chehalis.\nAs part of the investigation into the killings, a detective spoke by phone with a person described as a \u201cwitness from Kentucky,\u201d who said that two or three days earlier, Ivanov had sent him text messages \u201cregarding committing a mass shooting,\u201d the affidavit says.\nDetectives say Ivanov\u2019s recent social-media posts suggest he \u201cwas considering the murders \u2026 he later committed.\u201d\nPlay VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:00Loaded: 0%Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:00Playback Rate1\nChapters\nChapters\ndescriptions off, selected\nDescriptions\nsubtitles off, selected\nSubtitles\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\ncaptions off, selected\nCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreen\nThis is a modal window.\nCaptions Settings Dialog Beginning of dialog window.
