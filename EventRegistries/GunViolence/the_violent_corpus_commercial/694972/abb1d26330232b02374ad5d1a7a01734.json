There were some decisions made that made this reckless endangerment,\" Haskell said. \"I would suspect you've probably been beating yourself up every day since it happened and that's probably appropriate, but I don't think you need to continue doing that.\"\nSimmons' attorney Tom Dickson said the baby is OK and doing well. Burleigh County Assistant State's Attorney Justin Schwarz said the baby's mother was consulted on the plea agreement, which released Simmons from having to serve a mandatory two years in prison.\nSimmons was required to sell all his guns and pay $575 in court administration fees.\n\"He's a good father,\" Dickson said. \"We were unlucky here.\""}
