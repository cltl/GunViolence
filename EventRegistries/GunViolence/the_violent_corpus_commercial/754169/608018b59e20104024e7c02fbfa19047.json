The teen was reportedly sharpening the knife across a concrete sidewalk.\nResponding officers tried to disarm the teen using fire hoses, rubber bullets and Tasers over the course of about an hour, but all of it was ineffective, said Ed Hazel, Managing Deputy District Attorney.\nOfficers then chased him into a residence where the teen reportedly turned and charged the officers, and they opened fire on him. Officers were unclear at the time whether the residence was occupied or not, Hazel said.\nThe DA\u2019s Office is now reviewing evidence, witness statements, body camera footage, toxicology and autopsy reports, as they continue the investigation. Once completed, the DA\u2019s Office will publicly release its findings.\nIt will likely take about six to eight weeks for toxicology reports to come back, and it may take two to three months for the DA to complete its report, Hazel said."}
