He shot and killed his girlfriend, 37-year-old Tarasha Townsend, in the roadway out front, then chased Gabriel Taylor to nearby Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.\nMason shot his half-brother five times before he accidentally was struck by a Dodge pickup truck traveling along the road, police said.\nBoth men were taken to Bayonet Point Hospital in Hudson.\n\u201cSomething sparked Mr. Mason to decide he was going to kill everybody in the residence, and that\u2019s what he did,\u201d said Brooksville Police Chief George Turner.\nMore people were in the house at the time of the shooting but were not injured, Turner said. Investigators on Saturday were trying to determine what Mason and the others were discussing before the suspect pulled out the gun, the chief said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what the deal was,\u201d Turner said.\nGabriel Taylor was in critical condition Saturday and underwent surgery, Turner said. Mason sustained numerous internal injuries when he was struck by the passing truck. His condition was unknown.\nThe truck driver had nothing to do with the shooting, police said. He stopped immediately and cooperated with investigators.\nMason and Townsend had children together, Turner said.
