The Brevard County Sheriff's Office's bomb squad also responded and sent its robot inside, but it was later determined Smith wasn't inside the apartment.\n\"Palm Bay Authorities and U.S. Marshalls went to the address there, however, he had just left,\" said Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood. \"His girlfriend somehow found out we were coming and she tipped him off.\"\nDaytona Beach police officials said more than 50 people at the party. Smith was kicked out of the party, police said, and that's when shots were fired.\nInvestigators said there were no shooting victims at the scene when crews arrived, but officers saw drops of blood in the driveway.\nPolice then learned four victims drove to Halifax Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\nThe victims have been identified as Reginald Graham, 20, of Jacksonville; Vintonisha Smith, 19, of Mirimar; Frank Thomas, 21, of Jacksonville; and Darian Baker, 21, of Jacksonville.\nThomas and Baker are members of the Bethune-Cookman football team, according to the school's official roster.\n\"This isn\u2019t some neighborhood person coming in or some outsider coming in and creating an issue \u2013 these are people who have a direct connection to Bethune Cookman University in these two incidents,\" Chitwood said.\nSmith is believed to be driving an orange-colored 2011 Chevrolet Camaro with Florida tag DGK-D87 or temporary tag BFJ-3044, which may still be on the vehicle.\n\"We believe he\u2019s headed down to Miami,\" Chitwood said. \"That\u2019s where he\u2019s from, that\u2019s where he probably has family and friends that he thinks are going to hide him. But I\u2019ve been doing this for 28 years and I can tell you one thing, you can\u2019t outrun an arrest warrant.\"\nAnyone with information on the shooting or Smith's whereabouts is asked to call Crimeline at 800-423-TIPS (8477).\nBethune-Cookman University released the following statement Friday afternoon:\nThe Daytona Beach Police Department responded to an early morning shooting in the 300 block of Henry Butts Street. The off-campus incident did result in four B-CU students being injured and taken to the hospital. The students are currently recovering and all parents have been notified.\nWhile this unfortunate occurrence did take place off campus, B-CU administrators and the public safety department are proactively involved with this investigation. President Jackson is deeply concerned with the violence within the surrounding communities and will take the necessary steps to quickly address the challenges that pose threats to the safety of the campus and students.\n\"We are proud to be a part of this community. Essentially, it is an extension of our campus. We have a long and rich connection and we want to work together to find healthy alternatives for both our campus and the community,\" says President Edison O. Jackson.\nPresident Jackson and his leadership are continuously strengthening their policies and procedures and have complete confidence in their public safety department to keep their campus and students safe and secure. In addition, the president is looking into creating more opportunities to keep students involved with events and recreational activities on campus. The university is committed to increasing its efforts to eradicate violence and negative influences on its campus and within the community.
