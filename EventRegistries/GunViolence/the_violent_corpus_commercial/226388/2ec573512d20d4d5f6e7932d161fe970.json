There was a baby shower going on inside the location at the time.\nA group of people stepped outside for a smoke, unaware of what was about to happen: a hail of bullets, with people running in all directions to escape.\nThree men and one woman were shot, all in their early 20s.\nTwo victims, a 22-year-old man was shot in the chest and a 22-year-old woman was shot in the arm, were taken to Kings County Hospital.\nA 21-year-old man who was shot in the leg was rushed to Brookdale University Hospital.\nNone of the injuries is life threatening, and all three reportedly have criminal records.\nThe fourth victim, a 20-year-old man, was shot in his back right shoulder. He walked into Kings County Hospital hours later for treatment, telling detectives he was just walking by at the time of the shooting. He does not have a criminal record.\nPolice don't believe the shooting had anything to do with the baby shower, attended by about 100 people. There were seven people in front of the building at the time, five from the baby shower and two pedestrians.\nIn surveillance video, a white car can be seen slowing down and stopping before one, possibly two people get out and open fire.\nThe suspects were shooting at the direction of the individuals, but detectives believe their intended targets were not hit.\nPolice are still scouring the neighborhood for more surveillance video to get a better look at the car involved.\nSeveral cars in the area had their windows shattered by bullets. Police say more than 20 shots were fired.\nThe investigation is currently ongoing, and no arrests have been made. It is unclear how many gunmen were involved.\nPolice do not know whether there was a verbal dispute before the shooting. They believe the victims were originally inside the baby shower."}
