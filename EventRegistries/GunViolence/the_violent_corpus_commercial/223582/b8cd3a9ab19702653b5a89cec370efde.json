We\u2019re not sure where they\u2019re from, and shortly after they arrived, there was some type of fight and then the shooting following thereafter,\u201d said Allegheny County Police Lt. Andrew Schurman.\nIn all, six people were shot, and victims as well as patrons scattered. Two were in serious condition at mid-day. Three people were transported to hospitals from the scene. Three other victims showed up later at area hospitals by their own means.\nAll of the victims are men in their early 20s.\nThe gunfire started in the building, but may have spilled out into the street.\n\u201cThere is a car that showed up at one of the hospitals with bullet holes in it, so it may have,\u201d said Lt. Schurman.\nThe sign on the door said members only 21 or older, but investigators called what went on inside as a speakeasy where liquor was sold without a license.\n\u201cIn speaking with the Clairton police, the understanding that I have is that this establishment is not a licensed business, and in some capacity, they are selling alcohol illegally,\u201d said Lt. Schurman. \u201cThey used the term \u2018speakeasy\u2019 to describe it. Obviously, they were looking into what was going on in this building prior to the shooting.\u201d\nAllegheny County Police are continuing to investigate and look for witnesses.\nAnybody with information about the shooting is asked to call Allegheny County Police.\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Latest News Stories\nJoin The Conversation On The KDKA Facebook Page\nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter"}
