(AP) - Authorities say a 7-year-old girl was killed at a birthday party in Lexington County after a 5-year-old boy accidentally fired a gun.\nSheriff James Metts said the boy was trying to get a toy gun out of a trunk Saturday night at a home in Gaston when he picked up a real gun also in the trunk by mistake and fired it.\nDeputies say the bullet went through the car, and fragments hit Juliet Lynch in the chest. She died a short time later.\nMetts says the real gun belonged to the boyfriend of the boy's mother and she did not know it was in the trunk.\nThe sheriff says deputies are still investigating and charges could be filed in the shooting.\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
