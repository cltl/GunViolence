Authorities say the gunman was armed with at least two weapons when he fired at the Days Inn, then he shot at \"several vehicles.\"\nUpon the arrival of three BTPD officers, the suspect reportedly fired at police. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman Josh Devine says the officers returned fire and struck the suspect. BTPD Chief Blane Wade added that the incident was contained \"almost immediately\" upon the police response.\nDevine says all aspects of the investigation are ongoing, meaning that many specifics of the shootings cannot currently be discussed -- motives, where the shooter was from, his weapons used, exact timeline and progression of his firing of weapons.\nHe said investigators are working to determine any possible relationships between the suspect and victims, but at this time there appear to be no known associations.\nRead more from our media partners at the Kingsport Times-News."}
