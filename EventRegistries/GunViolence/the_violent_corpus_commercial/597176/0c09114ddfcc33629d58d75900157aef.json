(AP) -\nAuthorities say a man accused of killing a woman and injuring a police officer and two others when he shot at passing cars along a Tennessee highway has been indicted on charges including murder and attempted murder.\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation announced the indictment of 37-year-old Lakeem Keon Scott in a statement Tuesday. The statement says Scott also faces a charge of using a firearm during a felony for the shootings in Bristol last week.\nAuthorities have said they think Scott targeted police officers and others because he was troubled by incidents involving black people and law enforcement officers, but they're still investigating his possible motives.\nScott remains at a hospital, but was to be transferred to a jail after his release. It wasn't immediately clear whether he has an attorney.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."}
