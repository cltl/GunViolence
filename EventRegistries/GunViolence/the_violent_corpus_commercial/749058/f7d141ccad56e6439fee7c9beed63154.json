Chowchilla Police say the shooting happened Wednesday night just before 5 o'clock in the 200 Block of Alameda Avenue.\nChowchilla police officers describe this shooting as tragic and say officers who responded to the call are still shaken up. The Chowchilla Police Department is still in the early stages of this investigation. They know a young child got a hold of a gun and shot her sibling.\nInvestigators want to know how this could've happened.\n\"That's all part of the investigation and what we're trying to figure out but it's obvious that somehow the child was able to gain access to a firearm that they probably shouldn't of had access to,\" said Lt. Jeff Palmer of the Chowchilla Police Department.\nThe toddler who was shot died on the way to the hospital the Madera County coroner will do an autopsy soon.\nInvestigators say this is the first time in about two decades they've dealt with anything like this and the worst part is it was 100-percent preventable. They ask all gun owners to lock up their guns for safety. You can get gun locks at the Chowchilla Police Department.\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
