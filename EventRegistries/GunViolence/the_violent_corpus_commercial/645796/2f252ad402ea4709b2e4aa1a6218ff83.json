But evidence was still being compiled and analyzed Friday afternoon.\n\u201cRight now, it just looks like an accidental shooting,\u201d Lott said. His office also is consulting with the 5th Circuit prosecutor\u2019s office.\nDeputies who answered the emergency call from the Meredith Square townhouse apartments said they laid the 2-year-old in the yard. They tried to keep her alive with chest compressions and by applying pressure to the wound until an ambulance arrived, according to a sheriff\u2019s department incident report.\nHeaven Miller was pronounced dead at 7:07 p.m. at Palmetto Health Richland hospital minutes after her arrival, Richland County Coroner Gary Watts said. She died of complication from the gunshot, he said.\nThe unidentified 30-year-old father told deputies that he was cleaning his gun about 6:40 p.m. on the family\u2019s porch when it misfired after he sat on it, according to the incident report and Lott.\nThe bullet that struck the toddlers in the upper body also grazed the father\u2019s hand, according to the report and a news release. The 4-year-old required surgery, but her injury is not life threatening, Watts said.\nThe pregnant mother was at home when the shooting occurred and was taken to the hospital\u2019s delivery room, deputies said. Her baby was not born, said Watts, whose office is involved in the case."}
