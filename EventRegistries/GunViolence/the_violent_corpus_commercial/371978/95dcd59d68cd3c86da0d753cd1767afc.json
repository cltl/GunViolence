No adults were present at the time of the shooting, police say.\nThe shooting happened at a home in the Hoffman Heights neighborhood in 1000 Block of North Vaughn Street in Aurora. The 7-year-old does not live where the shooting happened.\nTabitha Christy lives next door and says a child ran to her home Thursday afternoon stating that his friend had been shot. Christy rushed to help and said the boys were crying and hysterical.\n\"The kid was laying on the flood half dead,\" Christy said, \"He was lifeless. His eyes went back to his head and I touched him to see if he was breathing, and he was barely breathing.\"\nInvestigators have not determined who fired the shot, but they think the shooting was an accident. Police are trying to figure out how the children were able to get the gun.\nIt's too soon to say whether any criminal charges would be filed in the case.
