New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison said the victims were driving into the complex when they were approached by \"at least one subject, perhaps more\" who opened fire into their car.\nOne man died at the scene. Harrison said the baby is listed in serious condition after surgery and another adult male victim is believed to be in fair condition.\n\"It's heartbreaking. It rips communities apart, it rips families apart, and some people kind of never fully recover from that,\" Harrison said. \"We know all to well what it is like to have lost children in our community.\"\nThe chief is urging anyone with information to call Crimestoppers at (504) 822-1111.\nCopyright 2016 WVUE.
