No bullet was recovered, police said.\nOfficers have no suspect information because the round \"seemed to be from the voluminous amounts of gunfire\" happening at the time, they said.\nOn Wednesday, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said celebratory gunfire is illegal and dangerous.\n\"There are many ways to enjoy the New Year, but firing random shots in the air should not be among them,\" Demings said in a statement.\nCharges for firing a firearm in public or on a residential property range from a first-degree misdemeanor to a third-degree felony, Demings said."}
