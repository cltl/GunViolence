Mims said staff in the investigations unit are plainclothes officers who investigate crimes such as narcotics and vice. No one was wearing a bulletproof vest.\n\u201cHe was truly a leader in the best terms I can describe,\u201d Mims said of Lucas, who joined the Sheriff\u2019s Office in September 1996. \u201cHe was the sergeant that people wanted to work for.\u201d\nLucas is the 12th sheriff\u2019s deputy killed on duty since the office\u2019s inception in 1856.\nThe incident still is being investigated. Mims said the detective whose gun went off has not been interviewed, nor had the sheriff spoken to him, \u201cbecause of his mental state,\u201d she said.\nPlease pray for us.\nMessage Sgt. Rod Lucas\u2019 wife asked Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims to pass along\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving him the time he needs,\u201d said Mims, who declined to identify the detective by name. \u201cWe\u2019re taking care of him.\u201d\nThere was no disagreement or argument occurring when the gun went off, Mims said. \u201cThere was nothing like that going on. We have no reason to think it was anything but an accident.\u201d\nThe sheriff said Lucas\u2019 death, coming less than two months after two correctional officers were shot in the jail lobby in early Septermber, hit the office hard.\n\u201cWe\u2019re grieving,\u201d she said.\nfacebook twitter email Share\nProcession for Fresno County sheriff's deputy who died after accidental shooting\nA procession of law enforcement vehicles travels from Community Regional Medical Center to highways 41 and 99 on Monday, October 31, 2016, for a Fresno County sheriff's deputy who died after being shot accidentally.\nSilvia Flores The Fresno Bee\nThe sheriff said she had spoken with Lucas\u2019 wife, and said she passed along a request: \u201cPlease pray for us.\u201d\nFamily man\nLucas grew up in Tranquillity in western Fresno County. He was married and had four children ranging in age from 12 to 28. He had one grandchild.\nLucas was an active member at Riverdale Assembly of God church in Riverdale. Pastor Charles Spencer said Lucas spoke at chapel services for the church\u2019s K-12 school and volunteered with outreach programs in the community\u2019s poorer neighborhoods.\nSpencer recalled an occasion when the sheriff\u2019s office brought in its dog unit for a demonstration and Lucas put on the protective gear. \u201cThey had the dog chase him down. He would say, \u2018I really hate to do this. It\u2019s not fun.\u2019 But he did it for the families.\u201d\nSpencer said several Fresno County sheriff\u2019s chaplains attend his church, including his son-in-law. Spencer\u2019s daughter and son-in-law taught Lucas and his wife in an adult Bible study class every Sunday and took the news very hard, he said.\n\u201cHe was a stable gentleman \u2013 faithful,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cEveryone in the church looked up to him.\u201d\nSunday\u2019s service would likely center around Lucas, Spencer said. The church typically has around 450 attendees each week.\n\u201cHis life is in harm\u2019s way all the time, but to have an accident like this happen \u2013 it affected me and my family very much,\u201d Spencer said.\nBoxing gold medalist\nLucas was athletic, playing football at least through community college (he was on the 1990 roster at then-Kings River, now once again Reedley College) and winning a gold medal in boxing at the 1997 California Police Summer Games in Fresno.\nFresno police Chief Jerry Dyer released a statement shortly after Tuesday\u2019s news conference:\n\u201cOn behalf of the Fresno Police Department, I would like to offer my condolences and ongoing support to the Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s department over the tragic loss of Sgt. Rod Lucas. Rod was a godly man with a reputation for being a great cop. He will be sorely missed in the law enforcement community and by those he worked with. My thoughts and prayers are with the sheriff\u2019s department, as well as Rod\u2019s wife, children, and parents.\u201d\nAt the news conference, Fresno County Supervisor Buddy Mendes said Lucas and his family lived in a tight community. Mendes said he knew Lucas\u2019 mother, and learned of the connection when he went to Community Regional hospital Monday night.\nAs the news conference ended, several sheriff\u2019s staff in attendance hugged each other.\nJim Guy: 559-441-6339, @jimguy27 Rory Appleton: 559-441-6015, @RoryDoesPhonics\nHow to help\nAnyone wishing to offer financial help to the family should send it to:\nFresno Deputy Sheriff\u2019s Association\n1360 Van Ness Ave., Fresno CA 93721\n(Place \u201cRod Lucas\u201d in the memo field)"}
