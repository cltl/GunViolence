Footage from the deputy's body-worn camera shows the dog slowly approaching Bray as she stood in the front yard of a home on Oakley Avenue.\n\"You better stay there, brother,\" the deputy said, addressing the dog.\nImmediately after, the video shows the dog becoming more aggressive, latching onto the deputy's pants leg. The deputy tripped and fired two shots at the dog, one of which hit the tip of her left ring finger.\nThe dog, meanwhile, died.\n\"I just shot my finger,\" Bray said. \"Okay, it hurts.\"\nWhen another deputy asked to see, Bray said she didn't want to look at it.\nThe Sheriff's Office noted that Bray is the owner of three pit bulls herself. She was placed on paid administrative leave and will return to light duty, sheriff's officials said."}
