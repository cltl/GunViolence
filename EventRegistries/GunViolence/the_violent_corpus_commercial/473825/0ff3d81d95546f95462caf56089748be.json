At this point the bullet has not been removed, which leaves investigators clueless as to what type of gun was fired.\nThe shooting was reported to the Stanislaus County Sheriff\u2019s Department around 3:15 p.m. Sunday at a farm that is off Marshall Road in Crows Landing. The farm is about a quarter mile east of the Turlock Sportsman Club, said sheriff spokesman Sgt. Anthony Bejaran.\nSheriff\u2019s investigators spoke to the members at the club that day and inspected all the guns, Bejaran said.\nThe club members were not the only shooters that day, however. There were people on the northwest corner of the San Joaquin River who had also been shooting, Bejaran said. The identity of those individuals and the types of guns they were shooting is unknown to investigators.\n\u201cAt this point we don\u2019t know where the bullet came from and it\u2019s possible we may never know,\u201d Bejaran said. \u201cWithout the round we can\u2019t determine the type of gun used.\u201d\nIt is not illegal to shoot guns from the riverbank, as long as the people are not trespassing, Bejaran said.\nBejaran said this was the first report of an errant round striking a person in that area.\n\u201cIt appears the shooting was unintentional,\u201d Bejaran said.\nInvestigators are hoping to speak to the individuals that were shooting from the riverbank. Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact the sheriff\u2019s department at 525-7114."}
