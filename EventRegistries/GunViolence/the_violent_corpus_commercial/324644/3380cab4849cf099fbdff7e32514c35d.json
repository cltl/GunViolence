Another car had pulled up alongside them and two people inside opened fire.\nIn court papers Kent detectives say the girl's father had been involved with the Deuce 8 street gang, which has an ongoing feud with a gang called Low Profile following the shooting of John Gerald Williams in Seattle on March 19."}
