Flamingo Road about 5:20 p.m., Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Tadd Dodds said.\nAfter the three masked teens rushed into the shop, the store employee fired about five rounds, Metro homicide Lt. Dan McGrath said. A bullet fatally struck one teen in the head, he said.\nPolice had yet to gain access to surveillance video from inside the store, McGrath said. It\u2019s unclear whether the teens had demanded money or were armed when they entered the shop, he added.\nBecause police have not seen the surveillance footage, it remains unclear whether the store employee will face charges in the shooting or whether either of the other two teens will be charged.\nThis was the 158th homicide within Metro\u2019s jurisdiction this year. The county coroner\u2019s office will name the teen killed once his family has been notified.\nReview-Journal writer Jessica Terrones contributed to this story.
