Christopher Simpson said.\nSpeaking to police, the man said he was walking along Homewild Avenue, near Loomis Park, when he approached a group of people who appeared as if \"they were ready to start fighting,\" Simpson said.\nPassing the group, the man said he heard a gunshot, while a bullet struck him in the pelvis-area, Simpson said.\nAfter the shooting, the man walked to a home in the 1700 block of Homewild Avenue, east of Loomis Park, where a friend transported him to Allegiance Hospital, Simpson said.\nAccording to Simpson, police are unsure what caliber gun was used during the shooting and believe the gunshot wound may have been self-inflicted.\n\"He wasn't the most cooperative victim,\" Simpson said, noting the man was unable to provide viable leads or suspect information.\n\"There appears to be more to this story than what we're (being) led to believe,\" he added.\nThe man's injuries were described as non-life-threatening. He was treated at Allegiance Hospital.\nThe shooting is under investigation.\nRyan Shek is a reporter for the Jackson Citizen Patriot and MLive.com. Contact him at rshek@mlive.com."}
