We\u2019re looking to see if any outstanding witnesses at the hiking trail might have seen or heard anything.\u201d\nAt 3:40 p.m. Sunday, authorities said, LAPD West Valley Area patrol officers responded to a radio call of a homicide at Northridge Hospital Medical Center.\nWhen officers arrived, they found Hernandez with a single gunshot wound. She died from the injury.\nInvestigators allege that at 3:15 p.m. Sunday, Hernandez and Gonzalez, along with two other people, drove to the south end of Vanalden Avenue in Tarzana.\nThe occupants then left the vehicle and hiked up a dirt trail, authorities allege, to test fire Gonzalez\u2019s handgun. When they returned to the car, Gonzalez shot Hernandez, police said.\nDetective Armijo said there was no dispute before the incident but he could not give more details about what may have led to the shooting.\n\u201cThey went out there to go fire a handgun. It was a 9 millimeter. That\u2019s all we have,\u201d Armijo said.\nHernandez was struck in the torso \u201cfrom side to side,\u201d the detective explained.\nGonzalez and Hernandez knew each other from work.\n\u201cShe met the suspect at a job where they formally worked together,\u201d Armijo said.\nThe two were friendly but were not dating, he added.\nAfter the shooting, Hernandez\u2019s friends drove her to the hospital, where she later died.\nFrom interviews, police learned of Gonzalez\u2019s alleged involvement.\n\u201cWe found the guy and interviewed him, and he confessed,\u201d Armijo said.\nAnyone with more information is urged to call Los Angeles Police Department Detective D.
