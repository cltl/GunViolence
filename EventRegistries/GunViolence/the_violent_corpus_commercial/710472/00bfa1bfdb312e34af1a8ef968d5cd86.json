Police said the woman found her car, saw it was empty, and went to have an extra key made, but when she arrived the second time, her car was gone.\nMetro-Nashville police were called on Thursday and an investigation began.\nThe car\u2019s GPS was tracked again Friday, and both K-9 officers and a helicopter were used to pinpoint the location.\nAccording to Aaron, the Oldsmobile was found driving down Oceanfront Circle in the South Shore neighborhood as a police cruiser was driving up the same street.\nThe Oldsmobile collided with the driver\u2019s side of the police cruiser, pinning the officer inside. Four people inside the Oldsmobile then bailed out of the passenger\u2019s side and took off running.\nAaron reported a K-9 officer spotted two of the suspects run into nearby woods a short time later.\nThe officer let his K-9 go after the suspects and one shot as heard. Once police got to the scene, one suspect was captured by the K-9 while another was found dead.\nAaron said the suspect was either shot by his accomplice or himself; two guns were found on the ground, and no Metro police officer ever fired a weapon.\nA third suspect was also caught by the K-9 about eight-tenths of a mile away, while the fourth was located inside a shed back near the homes in South Shore in the area of Beachfront Avenue and Oceanfront Circle.\nNone of the suspects\u2019 identities have been released at this time.\nThe investigation is ongoing.\nAaron said police still need to determine who shot the suspect that was killed in the woods\u2014himself or an accomplice.\nHe also said two bullet holes were found on the top of Oldsmobile, \u201cstrongly suggesting\u201d one of the suspects got out of the vehicle and fired two shots toward the police car.\n\u201cThe bullet holes are angled in such a way that they are facing toward the police car,\u201d Aaron explained. \u201cThe shots were fired in that direction.\u201d\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
