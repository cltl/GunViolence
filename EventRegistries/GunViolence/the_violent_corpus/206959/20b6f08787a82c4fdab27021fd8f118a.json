Tye Grant. Police were looking for the gunman.\nThe shooting occurred shortly after 7 p.m. at a 7-Eleven store at 10615 Blue Ridge Blvd.\nGrant said the Hooper was walking out of the store with a family friend when someone in a passing car fired multiple shots. The girl was struck by at least one bullet.\nThe car was driving on 107th Street, on the south side of the convenience store.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they were not intending to hit the young lady,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBut this is what happens when you\u2019re irresponsible like this.\u201d\nInvestigators will review surveillance video from the store. \u201cWe have some leads that we are working on right now,\u201d Grant said.\nA 7-year-old girl was in the store with a family friend when the shooting occurred.\n\u201cWe heard a big boom,\u201d the girl said. \u201cThere was a lot of drama going on. Everybody was freaking out.\u201d\nOfficers who were detaining possible witnesses at the store released the girl to her mother about 9 p.m.\nTia Strickland said her father and daughter drove into the store parking lot a few moments after the girl was shot.\n\u201cThey did see the little girl on the pavement. Very disturbing,\u201d Strickland said. \u201c... It could have been my daughter.\u201d\nIn a Twitter message, Police Chief Darryl Fort\u00e9 urged the shooter or shooters to surrender to police:\n\u201cTO SUSPECT(S): Please turn yourself in. I know you have a conscience. I don\u2019t believe the (girl) was the intended victim.\u201d\nThe store has been the site of other shootings in recent years.\nOn the afternoon of June 5, 2014, a shootout occurred in the store parking lot. Two men got into an altercation, and both pulled out guns and began shooting. Bullets struck the front window of the store and a nearby auto repair shop. No one was injured.\nOn April 17, 2013, a gunman tried to shoot a rival in a car parked outside the store.
