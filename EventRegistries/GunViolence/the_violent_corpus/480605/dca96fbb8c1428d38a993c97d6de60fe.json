Women are rarely the shooters in murder-suicides.\nNavarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner said at a news conference that the bodies of Ronquillo-Ovalle; her husband, Israel Alvarez, 33; and their sons, ages 4, 8 and 10, were discovered by Alvarez\u2019s father, who had to use a ladder to get into the house through a second-floor balcony. Tanner said there was no indication that Alvarez fired any shots.\nThe killings came less than two weeks after Alvarez was arrested Sept. 11 on a family violence charge.\nAccording to a sheriff\u2019s office report released Monday, Ronquillo-Ovalle went to her children\u2019s elementary school to call 911 because Alvarez took away her cellphone and removed the battery. She told a deputy that she was on the phone talking to her sister when Alvarez entered the room and pushed her.\nRecords show Alvarez pleaded no contest to family violence assault, a misdemeanor, and paid a $367 fine and was released after spending two days in jail.\nNo divorce filings or requests for a restraining order were filed, and Ronquillo-Ovalle did not ask for a protective order, according to records.\nTanner said investigators could not determine much from his arrest \u201cother than that was an isolated incident involving family violence.\u201d\n\u201cWe can only assume that there were problems in the household,\u201d Tanner said.\nMaria Franco, a family friend, said the couple came to her home on Sept. 16, asking for advice about keeping their relationship together. The couple talked about \u201cnormal problems\u201d they were having, she said.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything dangerous,\u201d Franco said.\nJosh Sugarmann, the executive director of the Violence Policy Center, said family murder-suicides usually happen after \u201can event that prompts the person to lose control,\u201d such as financial issues or domestic violence.\nBut usually, men are the shooters. Women commit only about 1 in 10 murder-suicides, according to the policy group\u2019s study of news accounts.\nA few such shootings have occurred in recent years in North Texas.\nIn 2010, Coppell Mayor Jayne Peters killed her 19-year-old daughter and then herself. Peters had faced financial difficulties, and investigators found depression medication in the home.\nAbout six months ago in Mesquite, Angelica Vazquez fatally shot her two adult children and her husband before killing herself.\nDetectives believe that before the slayings, Vazquez had withdrawn from her family and \u201cmissed family functions that she typically would have attended and had refused family members\u2019 suggestions to seek professional help,\u201d police spokesman Bill Hedgpeth said.\nVazquez family friend Gustavo Herrera said the mother hadn\u2019t been her usual happy, family-oriented self. But nobody saw any signs she would do something that \u201cwas so drastic,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is something you didn\u2019t expect from the mom,\u201d he said.\nStaff writer Tristan Hallman,\nThe Associated Press"}
