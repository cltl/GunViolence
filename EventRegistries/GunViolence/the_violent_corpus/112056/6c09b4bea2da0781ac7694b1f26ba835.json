Four men, including Pipkins and the victim, were sitting in a parked car when a gun went off, fatally wounding the victim, officials said.\n\"A back passenger pulled out a pistol, unloading it and was showing it to the others in the car,\" Houston Police Department spokesman Victor Senties said Sunday. \"It gets passed around and is returned to the original male.
