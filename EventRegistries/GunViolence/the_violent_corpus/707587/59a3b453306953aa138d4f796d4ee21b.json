The unidentified victim was said to have been in critical condition at a local hospital Wednesday.\nBecause of the Thanksgiving holiday, no updates on the incident or a subsequent investigation will be available until next week, said Deputy Mark Hollandsworth, a sheriff\u2019s office spokesman.\nJohn Randozzo, who lives in Goshen, said his sister was a religious woman and described her as the \u201cnext thing to a preacher.\u201d\n\u201cShe was a kind person. She tried to help everybody and she was into the Lord severe,\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe would preach to everybody and she didn\u2019t like nobody to do wrong.\n\u201cShe would give you the shirt off her back.

I love and miss you already. I just talked to you the other day. This just doesn\u2019t seem real right now, but I know you wouldn\u2019t want us to be crying and upset because you have made it home with the Lord and you are smiling down on us all.
