Police said it appears the victim was targeted and this was not a random shooting.\nNBC 7 spoke with the sister of the slain teen on Saturday as well as several friends who identified the victim as Anabell Flores. Her loved ones were distraught. They gave personal photographs of Flores to NBC 7 and shared a few details about the teen.\n\"Everybody loved Anabell; she was the best of life,\" said friend Nadia Musoke.\nThe teen's family and friends told NBC 7 Flores loved hanging out at Balderrama Park with her friends, and considered the playground home.\n\"There was no reason to kill. She\u2019s not out looking to cause problems; she just loved being here,\" Musoke added.\nThe girl's friends said they were having trouble coming to terms with Flores' sudden, violent death.\n\"To me, it doesn\u2019t even feel real. [It\u2019s] like she\u2019s still here,\" one friend who goes by Lani told NBC 7.\n\"She\u2019s passed away now? No, not her \u2013 she\u2019s a baby girl \u2013 15 years old,\" added Flores' friend, Santa Torres, in disbelief.\nHomicide detectives remained at the park Saturday collecting evidence. The police department said that as of 8:30 a.m. no suspects had been arrested in the deadly shooting of the teen.\nDetectives believe there were likely others present at the time of the shooting, and are working to track down all potential witnesses.\n\"We believe there were possibly witnesses on the scene during the incident, but we don\u2019t know what the role was of those witnesses,\" police said.\n\"We\u2019re still trying to piece this together,\" Ryan Keim, of the OPD, told NBC 7.\nNo further details were immediately released by police.\nThis isn't the first time a young victim has been shot to death at a park in the Oceanside community.\nIn March 2013, four teens -- including Melanie Virgen, 13, and Edgar Sanchez Rios, 16 -- were gunned down at Libby Lake Park in Oceanside. Rios and Virgen died, while the other two teens survived the shooting. The suspects in that slaying were sentenced earlier this year.\nBefore that, in May 2011, the bodies of teens Fernando Felix Solano, 16, and Sandra Salgado, 14, were found shot to death near Libby Lake Park.\nA community impacted by gang activity, Oceanside continues to rebuild after the violent tragedies, promoting a better life for youth through mentoring programs such as the Vista Community Clinic\u2019s Project REACH.\nWith each violent shooting, the community has been shaken to its core. Parents in Oceanside say they are outraged and frustrated that these types of shootings keep happening \u2013 robbing teens of their lives.\n\"You\u2019ve [taken] away someone\u2019s child, and you\u2019ve taken away my family,\u201d said Lani.\nThe community is praying the violence will stop.\n\u201cStop it. Stop That. No more,\u201d added Torres.\nFlores\u2019 loved ones told NBC 7 they hope police catch the person who killed the teen and that they are swiftly brought to justice.\nAnyone with information can call the OPD at (760) 435-4911."}
