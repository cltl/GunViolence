(WBBH) - A Florida woman was killed in an accidental shooting Tuesday evening at the Punta Gorda Citizen Police Academy.\nChief Tom Lewis called Tuesday night's incident a \"horrible accident.\" He said the shooting happened during a \"shoot or don't shoot\" scenario in which they use simulated lethal force in a live role play.\nTwo participants were randomly selected. Lewis said there were approximately 35 people in attendance.\nLewis said the victim, 73-year-old Mary Knowlton, was \"mistakenly struck with a live round.\"\nKnowlton was transported to Lee Memorial and pronounced dead.\nSo how did real bullets end up in the gun used Tuesday night?\n\"That's a great question, and the investigation is going to detail how all those details were missed,\" a police spokesperson said.\nMultiple witnesses say the officer involved in the shooting was Officer Lee Coel.\nControversy surrounded Officer Coel earlier this year after a man sued the City of Punta Gorda and the police department claiming Cole and his K9 went too far during a traffic stop arrest. A video showed Coel sending his K-9 to help take down a bicyclist, and then allowed the dog to stay latched on for nearly two minutes."}
