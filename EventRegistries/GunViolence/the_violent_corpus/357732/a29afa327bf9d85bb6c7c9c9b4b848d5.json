Approximately 200 teenagers attended the get-together.\nFayette County Sheriff Barry Babb said the homeowner tried to shut down the party. People cleared out, leaving beer bottles and tire marks all over the lawn. That's when someone pulled out a gun.\n\"I heard at least 10 to 13 shots,\" witness Marqes Woods said.\nBabb said five people were shot. Wali Clanton, 19, of Stockbridge was struck in the chest and killed.\n\"It's crazy. A teenager is dead, over nothing,\" Woods said. \"I just want to know why. Was is really that important to take a life?\"\nThree more male victims were hurt. A female party goer was also shot in the ankle.\nClanton passed away on the way to an area hospital. Two of the surviving victims were taken to Grady Memorial Hospital, while the other two were transported to Atlanta Medical Center. Their names were not released. Babb said none of their injuries were considered life-threatening.\n\"He's a phenomenal kid,\" said Wali Clanton Sr. who flew up from Tampa Sunday afternoon. \"He's just an awesome kid.\"\nClanton graduated from Dutchtown High School in Henry County in 2014. He played football at Kentucky State University and was studying to be a physician's assistant.\nKentucky State issued a statement on Monday saying:\nThe Kentucky State University community is deeply saddened by the loss of one of our students. Wali Clanton had been an involved and active student on campus, where he showed interest in and walked on last fall as a freshman member of KSU's football team. A potential nursing student, Wali often assisted with the university's Student Health Center activities and was always ready with a big smile.\nWe were certainly upset upon hearing the news of this young man's tragic death in Georgia. He will remain in our thoughts as the campus community comes together in light of this tragedy. We offer our deepest sympathy and support to Wali Clanton's family and friends.\nTwitter tributes to Clanton describe him as a sweet young man with big dreams. Woods said he wants to see his killer brought to justice.\nWhile sheriff's investigators are following several strong leads, they have not yet made an arrest in the shooting."}
