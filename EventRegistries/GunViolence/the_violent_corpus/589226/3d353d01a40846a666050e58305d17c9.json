Witnesses told police that two men involved in the shooting fled in a red Pontiac Grand Am.\nDetectives found the car's owner, who said Morttellus Dashown Hill and Christopher Michael Johnson Jr., both 19, were responsible for the shooting, according to officials.\nHill and Johnson were arrested near their homes in the 1800 block of Northeast 53rd Street on Friday night and Saturday morning, respectively.\nHill has been charged with first-degree murder. No bail has been set for his release.\nJohnson was charged with accessory to commit a felony after the fact, and his bail was set at $10,000.\n\u201cThis homicide is not a reflection of our city, but an indictment on our society,\u201d Midwest City Police Chief Brandon Clabes said. \u201cNow, instead of resolving disputes in a civil manner, these young adults resort to violence, which is a direct correlation on how they are raised without character qualities or respect for life.\n\"We continue to talk about justice reform but it all starts with the family unit, if we don\u2019t demand parents take responsibility in raising their children correctly we will never win the war on violent crime and senseless deaths. It is very frustrating for law enforcement.\""}
