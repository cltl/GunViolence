Madison Street about 4:30 p.m. when he was hit by a stray bullet that broke through a door.\nSomeone at the home drove the boy to Lancaster General Hospital, but the boy was later transferred by medical workers to Hershey Medical Center, where he underwent surgery.\nPolice late Sunday were still interviewing the shooter and a dozen or so witnesses who were at the home for a family gathering on Easter.\nThe victim lives at the home where the shooting occurred and is related to the shooter, police said.
