Hershey Medical Center, police said, because Hershey has more experience with pediatric trauma victims.\nThe boy suffered a single gunshot wound, but police did not release the location of the wound. Police also did not release the boy's condition.\nDetectives were interviewing several witnesses to the shooting, which occurred outdoors, police said.\nPolice did not yet know if the shooting was accidental, intentional or if the boy was the victim of a stray bullet.\n\"It's too early to tell,\" Sgt. Phil Berkheiser told PennLive about 7:15 p.m. \"We have all the players. They're being interviewed now.\"\nBerkheiser said police hoped to release more information in several hours."}
