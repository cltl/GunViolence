Tony Figueroa of the Watsonville Police Department.\nThe person fired rounds at a house in the 300 block of Ford Street in Watsonville shortly before 4 a.m., Figueroa said. No one was injured except the boy, who was shot once and air lifted to a Bay Area trauma center.\nAuthorities did not know the person\u2019s motive.\nWatsonville police Sgt. Brian Ridgway said it appears the boy\u2019s injuries were non-life-threatening.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still tragic nonetheless,\u201d he said. \u201cA 9-year-old shouldn\u2019t be shot in their home, they should be safe.\u201d\nSan Francisco Chronicle staff writer Kimberly Veklerov contributed to this report.\nJenna Lyons is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
