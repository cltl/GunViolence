It really hurts my heart to know that he's not going to be here tomorrow, and I can't call him to\u2014. I just don't understand,\" Powell explained.\nFriends said Walker, his brother and some friends got into some sort of altercation with another group at the Overton High School basketball game on Friday night.\n\"The police told them to get off the school premises with all that,\" Powell recalled.\nA short time after the shooting, the victims' car was found at St. Francis Hospital riddled with bullet holes.\nDoctors pronounced Walker dead, a 16-year-old was flown to the hospital in extremely critical condition, an 18-year-old was hit in his side and the driver wasn't injured.\nFor many at Overton High, the group of young men is like family, which makes coping with the loss harder to deal with.\n\"Y'all see that it's hurting. Like his mom is torn. He was the baby. His brother. He only had one brother. He was the baby,\" Powell said.\nWalker was a teenage boy who had his life snatched away far too soon."}
