Jeff Goodwin.\nPolice Lt. James Weiskopf said it appeared the gunshot, from a handgun, was self-inflicted. He also said there appeared to be no adult supervision at the home.\nOfficers and medical personnel were called just before 5:30 p.m. to a home in the 9100 block of Wine Cellar Avenue, near the intersection of Pebble and South Fort Apache roads.\nPolice said the boy's 6-year-old sister went to a neighbor's house after the shooting and the neighbor called police. Neighbors, who asked to remain anonymous, said the sister was screaming about blood.\nThe children's parents didn't return to the home until after police had already arrived, the neighbors said. They said the neighborhood is close-knit and there's no way the shooting could have been the result of a home invasion.\nCoroner's investigators arrived on the scene about 9:35 p.m. Police said no charges have been filed.\nContact Kimber Laux at klaux@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0381.
