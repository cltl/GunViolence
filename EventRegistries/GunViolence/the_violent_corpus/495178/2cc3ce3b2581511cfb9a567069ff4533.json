(November 30, 2013) \u2014 An east side house party erupted in gunfire late Friday night, in the 3400 block of East 34th Street. That\u2019s near Olney Avenue.\nThe woman who lives there told police she was throwing a party for her teen daughter, when the crowd became to large for her to control. So she began abruptly ejecting people from the home. But just before 10:30 p.m., a group of males came back and began firing shots from the street, and then from the front doorway.\nTwo 16 and 17-year-old girls were taken to Riley. One had a fragment injury to her hand, while the other girl had been grazed. Both teens were in good condition.\nAnother person, an 18-year-old male, arrived at Wishard on his own, shot in the legs. He said it had happened at the same location as the party.\nPolice are still investigating this shooting. If you have any information, you;re urged to call (317) 262-TIPS."}
