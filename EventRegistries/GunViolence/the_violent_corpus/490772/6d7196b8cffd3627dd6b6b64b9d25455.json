A bullet hit a man, 40, in the arm, and a teenage boy suffered a graze wound to the leg.\nProsecutors opted to charge Garrett only with possession of a firearm.\nAt at bond hearing Thursday, attorney Michael Solock argued repeatedly that Garrett had been on his own land at the time of the incident and deserved a low bail amount.\n\"You want to carry a gun, these are the consequences,\" said Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr., noting that multiple children in Chicago have been shot in recent weeks by stray bullets, including two boys, ages 5 and 7, who were among 70 people wounded in gun violence over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.\nBourgeois set Garrett's bond at $50,000."}
