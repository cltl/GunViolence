This is the second case in Rock Hill within two months in which a toddler fired a loaded weapon.\nby Teddy Kulmala\nSunday\u2019s shooting was the second by a toddler in Rock Hill in barely a month.\nLast month, police charged the great-aunt of a 2-year-old boy with unlawful carrying of a gun after the child was able to get the gun while in the woman\u2019s car, accidentally shooting the child\u2019s grandmother. The grandmother survived.\nA man who answered the door at the Amelia Avenue home Monday said he was Savion\u2019s uncle. He shared pictures of Savion, but said he didn\u2019t have \u201ctoo much to talk about.\u201d\nThere was at least one other child, a 10-year-old girl, and at least four adults in the home at the time of the shooting, according to a police report.\nNeighbors were stunned Monday that the boy had been killed.\nJacquie McCann, who lives next door to the family, said she could only cry when she heard what happened. She said Savion had an \u201cinfectious\u201d laugh and smile.\n\u201cWe literally just moved to Rock Hill within weeks of when he was born,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting perspective from a 3-year-old point of view. It was fun to watch him grow.\u201d\nMcCann said Savion\u2019s family were their first friends after moving onto the block.\n\u201cThey\u2019re good people; it\u2019s just tragic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just gonna give them time to do what they\u2019ve got to do, then we\u2019ll go over and see if there\u2019s anything else we can do to help them.\u201d\nOther neighbors also were shocked at Savion\u2019s death, recalling how he often played outside.\n\u201cIt is just terrible,\u201d said neighbor Tonya Hamm.\nHamm said police were at the house for hours on Sunday.\nChampagne Howell, 20, walked along the news vans and reporters on Amelia Avenue on Monday. She has lived in the neighborhood for several months and said she often saw Savion outside playing.\n\u201cHe used to always come up to me and call me his girlfriend,\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cFor him to be 3 and talking about a girlfriend \u2013 you know.\u201d\nAn autopsy was scheduled for Monday afternoon.\nTeddy Kulmala: 803-329-4082, @teddy_kulmala\nAndrew Dys: 803-329-4065"}
