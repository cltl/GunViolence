But he also described skulking outside for a couple of hours and sneaking up close enough to eavesdrop on conversations. He admitted being angry and jealous that Anna Bui appeared to be having a good time without him.\nIvanov reportedly described going back to his car and spending about 20 minutes reading the owner\u2019s manual for the Ruger AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle he\u2019d purchased four days earlier. He needed to know how to load and ready the weapon to fire.\n\u201cIvanov admitted that when he put the magazine in the rifle and took the rifle out of the car that he intended to kill people,\u201d Mukilteo police detective John Ernst said in an affidavit filed in support of Snohomish County Superior Court search warrants. \u201c\u2026 He admitted that at the moment he loaded the magazine, his plan was to return to the party and use the rifle. Ivanov maintained that he did not mean to shoot Bui.\u201d\nWhen confronted with evidence he\u2019d deliberately targeted the young woman, Ivanov reportedly responded in fragments: \u201cIf you were in that situation, it\u2019s hard to, I\u2019m not trained.\u201d\nThen, according to the detective, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to do.\u201d\nIvanov is charged with three counts of aggravated murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder. The 19-year-old from Mukilteo has pleaded not guilty. He\u2019s been ordered jailed without bail. Prosecutors have 120 days to decide whether to seek capital punishment. Aggravated murder carries two possible sentences: death or life in prison.\nThe new search warrants were sought so detectives can pore over social media accounts used by Ivanov, Bui and others. They\u2019ve been using texts, Twitter posts and other digital evidence to document the interactions Ivanov had with others in the days leading up to the shootings.\nMuch of the information contained in the affidavits already has appeared in charging papers. There are more details, however, about Ivanov\u2019s discussion with detectives after the shootings and excerpts of text messages to a friend in Kentucky whom he enlisted in an attempt to learn the party\u2019s location and to monitor Bui\u2019s social media.\nThat friend told investigators that in the days leading up to the attack, Ivanov had sent messages about shooting people, but he thought they were \u201cjust joking around.\u201d\nIvanov told detectives that he was in touch with Bui in the hours leading up to the shootings. On July 28, he put his rifle in his car and then drove to a quiet spot to sit alone, he said. On July 29, he purchased a second magazine for his rifle. He texted Bui at about 6:30 after he\u2019d finished shopping.\n\u201cHe said that Bui and his family had been worried about him because of his behavior the previous night,\u201d Ernst wrote. \u201cHe wanted to assure Bui that he was not suicidal or \u2018crazy.\u2019 He said, \u2018I wanted to assure her that I wasn\u2019t going to do anything.\u2019\u201d\nIvanov said Bui met him in the parking lot of a Walmart a short time later and they talked for about half an hour. She then went to a friend\u2019s house and from there to the party.\nThe defendant described how he later parked near the house party and crept to a place near an outdoor fire pit. He was near enough to hear conversations.\n\u201cIvanov said what he heard made him angry, and he could see Bui through the window and believed she was flirting with male partygoers,\u201d the search warrant said. \u201cHe said this made him angry, so he went down to his car.\u201d\nJake Long was shot first when he came across Ivanov hiding with his rifle. Will Kramer was struck in the shoulder but was able to run, wounded, to safety. Jordan Ebner was shot multiple times and did not survive.\nIvanov allegedly admitted to shooting Bui when he tracked her down inside the home.\n\u201cI knew she knew who I was \u2018cause I saw her face right before I pulled the trigger,\u201d he reportedly told detectives."}
