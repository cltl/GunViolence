A passerby even left flowers on the front yard.\nRoselle said he and his wife adopted Evan when he was only two weeks old, and were devastated when authorities knocked on their door at 3 a.m.\n\"No, we don't have anymore kids,\" he said. \"I loved him more than anything else in the world.\"\nOfficers were called to the scene off Golden View Court after midnight on Dec. 4, 2014.\nPolice say the victim's friend told authorities the gun went off accidentally while the teens were playing with the weapon.\nOfficers investigated at the scene for more than eight hours.\nThe 16-year-old teenager was eventually booked into the Tarrant County Juvenile Detention Center on a negligent homicide charge.\nMike Roselle said he told his son not to visit the house where he was killed prior to his death.
