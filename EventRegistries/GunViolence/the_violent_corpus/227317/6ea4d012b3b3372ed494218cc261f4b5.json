Jeffrey Houston, an Arlington police spokesman.\nThe 17-year-old was visiting his friend\u2019s house in the 1200 block of Golden View Court when the shooting occurred shortly after midnight.\n\u201cThe 16-year-old accidentally shot the 17-year-old,\u201d Houston said.\nThe older teen was pronounced dead at the scene. He had not been identified by the Tarrant County medical examiner\u2019s office late Thursday, but his father told Star-Telegram media partner WFAA that his adopted son\u2019s name is Evan Roselle.\nMichael Roselle said that he and his wife adopted the boy when he was 2 weeks old. He said Evan was their only son.\nHouston said detectives were trying to learn how the teens got the gun, reported stolen in November.\nThe 16-year-old lived with his grandparents, who were at home but not with the teens, Houston said.\nRoselle told WFAA that he had instructed his son not to go to the house.\nAbby Cloud, a Mansfield school district spokeswoman, said the 17-year-old victim was not enrolled as a student but had attended Summit High School for 10 days in the spring. She did not know the reason he left.\nDeanna Boyd, 817-390-7655\nTwitter: @deannaboyd"}
