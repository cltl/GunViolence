Bell was booked into jail in New Orleans, La., at about 2:30 p.m. local time Thursday. Gwinnett County police said the 34-year-old, a suspect in the Sept. 15 triple homicide on Anderson Livsey Lane, had been tracked down by the U.S. Marshall\u2019s Service and the Gwinnett County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s fugitive unit, who \u201cdeveloped intelligence on a possible location for Bell in New Orleans.\u201d\n\u201cThe local fugitive task force in New Orleans checked the location, a homeless shelter, and located Bell,\u201d police spokesman Cpl. Jake Smith said. \u201cHe led law enforcement officials on a brief foot chase before being taken into custody.\u201d\nNo further information about the arrest was available Thursday. Gwinnett County detectives will travel to New Orleans to follow up, Smith said.\nAuthorities believe Angela Benton had taken Bell and his wife into her home when they hit hard times. But as Benton, her 12-year-old son, 19-year-old godson and 23-year-old boyfriend arrived home from out of town on the evening of Sept. 15, Bell was allegedly waiting inside with a semi-automatic rifle.\nAll but the boyfriend, Justin Cato, were shot and killed. Bell reportedly fled on foot \u2014 Benton, who was driving Bell\u2019s SUV, still had his keys \u2014 and hadn\u2019t been seen since.\nAfter Gwinnett County police initially hypothesized their suspect could be in south Georgia, Tennessee, or Chicago, a pickup truck stolen half a mile from the Sept. 15 murder scene was recovered earlier this month near New Orleans.\nBell will eventually be extradited to Gwinnett to face charges including murder and aggravated assault."}
