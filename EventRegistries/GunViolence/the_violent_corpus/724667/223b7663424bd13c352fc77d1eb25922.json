(KCRA) \u2014\nFour people were injured Monday night in a shooting at a North Highlands apartment, the Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department said.\nA 39-year-old woman was shot in the head and was listed in critical condition. A 38-year-old woman, a 21-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl were listed in serious condition, Sgt. Tony Turnbull said.\nA man fired shots from outside through a closed door just before 9 p.m. at an upstairs apartment in the Magnolia Court Apartment Complex in the 4800 block of Myrtle Avenue.\n\u201cWhat do you say about something like that? That somebody fires indiscriminately through a door. They don\u2019t know who\u2019s on the other side,\" Turnbull said. \"Whether they knew who\u2019s on the other side or not, you put a lot of people\u2019s lives at risk -- and for what? \u2026 There\u2019s really no justification for it.\u201d\nSixteen people were in the apartment at the time of the shooting, including five children between the ages of 4 and 16 years old.\n\"We had a lot of victims, but it definitely could have been a lot worse,\u201d Turnbull said.\nAfter a preliminary investigation, detectives believe the gunman is the ex-boyfriend of one of the people inside of the apartment. However, it is unknown if there are multiple people connected to the shooting.\nNo other details were released."}
