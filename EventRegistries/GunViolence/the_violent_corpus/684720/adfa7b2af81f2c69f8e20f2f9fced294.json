One of the instructors noticed the injury and provided the deputy with medical attention.\nAn ambulance took the deputy to SAMMC, where he is in stable condition.\nSheriff\u2019s Office spokesman James Keith said it\u2019s a training instructor\u2019s worst nightmare to see someone injured by his or her own gun or someone else\u2019s during training exercises.\n\u201cOur hearts go out to him. We hope that he has a speedy recovery, and we plan to use this as a lesson for others. And we hope to make some positive out of it,\u201d Keith said.\nAn internal investigation is underway to determine whether the deputy will face disciplinary actions or a change in duties as a result of the shooting, which authorities said appeared to be accidental.\nCopyright 2016 by KSAT - All rights reserved."}
