Police are trying to contact the 3-year-old\u2019s father, Dolunt said. \u201cThe 11-year-old\u2019s father was at the house,\u201d he said. \u201cHe apparently showed them the gun.\u201d\nInvestigators also want to interview the 11-year-old, Dolunt said. \u201cHe\u2019s scared,\u201d he said. \u201cHe admitted to being in the car, but we need to talk to him to get more details.\u201d\nBarbara Brianna was landscaping in the yard across the street when she heard what sounded like firecrackers, then screaming. She raced over and learned a child had been shot in the head.\n\u201cThe guns, they should have been locked ... up in a safe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened like that. How can a child have that much access to some guns?\u201d\nInvestigators remained on the shooting scene for hours. At one point, three vehicles were towed from the brown brick home. A man whom acquaintances identified as the driver of one left in a police car, but an officer told them he was not under arrest.\nA family had lived in the home for several years, and children often play there, said a neighbor. Though he hadn\u2019t heard of problems at the home, the shooting Monday suggested \u201cpure negligence,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid. How can you let a kid play with a gun?\u201d\nNow, relatives are seeking donations to cover funeral costs for the child they described as a \u201csweet baby boy\u201d on a GoFundMe page launched Monday.\n\u201cElijah was always on the go with his incredible amount of energy and never failed to give anyone his million dollar smile. He loved playing with his two older sisters and cousins,\u201d the page read.\n\u201cHis bright smile, contagious laughter, and sweet personality will forever be missed. He was and will always be loved by his entire family and we are extremely devastated by this tragic loss.\u201d"}
