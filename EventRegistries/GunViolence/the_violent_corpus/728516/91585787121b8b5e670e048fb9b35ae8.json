One of the suspects pulled out a handgun and shot the victim in the leg multiple times, police said.\nThe female was not injured.\nThe victim was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries and is expected to survive.\nPolice said the victim did not have any gang ties.\nThe three suspects, believed to be males between the ages of 14 and 17, drove away and have yet to be found, according to police.\nThe suspects' vehicle was described only as a white, four-door car.\n\"If you see a vehicle with that description, I know it's pretty vague, especially if it's occupied, please give us a call at the Oxnard Police Department,\" Sgt. Bakari Myers told KTLA. \"Don't try to initiate contact with the occupants yourselves. They should be considered armed and dangerous.\"\nKTLA's Geoff Peters contributed to this story."}
