Saturday afternoon's accidental shooting happened when the family was viewing the Beaverdam Road home that was for sale.\n\"The investigation revealed that while the family was viewing a home for sale, the two children followed a cat into a bedroom. One child followed the cat under the bed, where the handgun was stored,\" investigators said. \"The victim was shot in the leg and had non-life threatening injuries.\"\nNo criminal charges will be brought in this incident, investigators said.\nRich Pates, who lives across the street from the home, said it was a typically quiet area, but he did hear an unusual sound on Saturday afternoon.\n\"Sirens,\" he said, \"sirens are a rarity out here, especially multiple sirens.\"\nHe said he was shocked when he learned what emergency crews were doing on his street. He called Saturday's incident a reminder to be careful if you do have firearms in your home.\nSmitty Smith, who is unrelated to the incident, has been in the real estate business for 20 years. He said he had never encountered something like this before.\n\"We always advise our clients to clear the home of small valuables of things that can be easily bumped into and broken,\" said Smith.\nSmith said after hearing about this incident, he will start talking to clients about being extra cautious if someone does have a weapon in their home. He also said he'll be reminding people to keep an eye on their children.\nNo charges were filed in connection to Saturday's shooting.\n\"Each of these incidents are unique and cannot always be compared with similar cases,\" Hanover County Sheriff\u2019s Office Deputy Karen Godfrey said. \"Based on a review of the circumstances and a consultation with the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, it was determined charges were not warranted in this specific incident.\""}
