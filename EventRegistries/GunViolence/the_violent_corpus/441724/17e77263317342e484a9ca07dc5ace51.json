A family member of the dead boy called the shooting unwarranted.\nCity marshals were chasing Chris Few at about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, after he fled from an attempt to serve a warrant, the coroner in Avoyelles Parish where the shooting occurred had said Wednesday. Few was critically wounded and his 6-year-old son, Jeremy Mardis, died of multiple gunshot wounds to his head and chest, the coroner, Dr. L.J. Mayeux, had added.\nThe coroner said the boy was \u201ccaught in the line of fire\u201d and killed. Few was listed in serious condition Thursday, hospital officials said.\nAuthorities have released few details of what took place.\nCol. Mike Edmonson, the head of state police, said at a news conference in Marksville on Thursday that no gun was found inside Few\u2019s vehicle. He said the investigation was just beginning and there were \u201ca lot of unanswered questions\u201d but investigators would be methodical in seeking out the facts.\n\u201cAnytime an individual is killed, especially a child, it\u2019s a tragedy,\u201d Edmonson said. \u201cThe investigative team spent 12 hours Wednesday going through the entire scene from a forensic standpoint to get the trajectory of the bullets, find and count the casings and generally put the scene together.\u201d\nHe said video pertaining to the shooting had not been analyzed and that officers involved in the shooting had not been interviewed yet. Three of the officers also work for the Marksville Police Department and one works as a city marshal in nearby Alexandria.\nFew\u2019s 57-year-old stepfather, Morris German, accused the city marshals of indiscriminately opening fire on the vehicle. German said Few was heavily sedated, unable to talk and has bullet fragments lodged in his brain and lung. He described Few as a loving father and added the man\u2019s son \u201cwas his whole life.\u201d\n\u201cI know a 6-year-old should not have been shot,\u201d German said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what my son was doing.\u201d\nGerman said he was unaware of any warrants against Few.\nHe called his stepson a law-abiding person who\u2019d once been charged with driving under the influence but otherwise had a spotless record. He said Few works as a river pilot on the Red River and is routinely tested for drugs.\nHe also strongly doubted his stepson was carrying a weapon and said he found it hard to believe he would flee authorities with his son in the vehicle.\n\u201cAnything\u2019s possible, but I can\u2019t see him doing that with his son in the car,\u201d German said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like him at all.\u201d\nMardis was diagnosed with autism, German said, describing him as a delightful child who \u201cloved everything, everybody.\u201d German said the boy had no siblings. The family recently moved to Marksville from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, he said.\nAt his news conference, Edmonson said he had no information about a warrant being served. The sheriff\u2019s and district attorney\u2019s offices said they had no pending warrants against Few.\nFew reached a dead end and was backing into the marshals when they fired, the coroner had said.\nLocal media has reported Few was seen at a bar, TJ\u2019s Lounge in Marksville, arguing with a female friend shortly before the shooting. The bar is less than a mile from where the dead end where the shooting took place.\nA bartender at the lounge confirmed Thursday evening that Few left the bar shortly before 9 p.m. after playing pool with friends, heading out to pick up his son. But he said nothing happened there that might have led to the shooting. He declined to be identified by name.\nEdmonson said investigators received a short written statement from the marshals. He said the marshals stated that the vehicle they shot at was backing up into them. But he declined to provide more details. He added that the marshals now have lawyers.\nThe city marshals work for the city courts and serve warrants, carry firearms and have police powers, according to a city judge, Angelo Piazza, describing their powers as akin to a sheriff in that community."}
