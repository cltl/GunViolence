One of the residents, Triston Whitmire, 19, was arrested Saturday and charged with four counts of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. He was booked into the county jail on a $60,000 bond.\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed in Metropolitan Court, Whitmire said he and his two roommates were having a party at their home when a couple of people he knew from the neighborhood showed up uninvited and began allowing others into the house. He told police he saw that one was armed so he tried to shut down the party.\nBut, Whitmire said, he also put his own gun in his pocket.\nWhitmire said he locked several people outside, but the would-be partygoers started kicking the door to get back inside and broke a window.\nHe stayed in the house but began firing at them, according to the complaint.\n\u201cAs soon as the glass was shattered, Triston removed his firearm and fired through the recently broken glass,\u201d the officer wrote in the complaint. \u201cTriston fired at least four rounds outside.\u201d\nWhitmire didn\u2019t know anyone had been hit until officers told him, according to the complaint.\nOfficers were dispatched to the house, which police say has a history of loud parties and gunfire, around 2:20 a.m. to find a man who had been shot lying in the front yard. The 23-year-old had been shot in the neck and was taken to the hospital in critical condition, the complaint says.\nA short time later, three more men showed up at the University of New Mexico Hospital. An 18-year-old had several gunshot wounds to his abdomen, leg and pelvic area, a 21-year-old had been shot in the left leg, and a 22-year-old had been shot in the right leg, according to the complaint.\nThe scene outside the home midmorning Saturday showed signs of the abandoned party and bloodshed.\nThe front door of the home was open and what appeared to be a shirt and a shoulder bag were left covered in blood in the yard. Five pickup trucks were parked in the front yard, and several other cars lined the streets.\nThree trails of blood could be seen leading away from the house in various directions, and the yard and nearby streets were littered with empty beer bottles, cans and liquor bottles.\nLisa Gray, who lives nearby, said she awoke between 1 and 2 a.m. to hear her neighbors throwing a party.\nGray said she heard the gunshots and looked outside to see two or three men walking down the street toward the party house. She said she could see the muzzle flashes as one of them began firing off several rounds. She called 911.\n\u201cThis guy was walking down the middle of the street; he pulls out a gun and shot into the crowd of people,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI just closed the door and got down.\u201d\nOfficer Simon Drobik, a spokesman for the Albuquerque Police Department, said he didn\u2019t know if police are looking for other suspects or if they believe Whitmire is the only one who injured people.\nDigital Editor Robert Browman contributed to this report."}
