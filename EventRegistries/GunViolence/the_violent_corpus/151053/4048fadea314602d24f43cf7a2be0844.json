Responding officers did CPR but the teen died at the scene, Clark said.\nEight other people who were inside the apartment during the shooting were questioned, Clark said. Detectives determined the suspect, who is from Santa Cruz and lives at the apartment, likely unintentionally shot the victim, who was his friend.\nThe suspect, whom police did not name, was booked into Santa Cruz County's juvenile hall on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter.\n\"The charge reflects that it may have been unintentional but it was not accidental,\" Clark said. \"There were some intentional behaviors that had to happen leading up to this. We know the gun had to be displayed in some way.\"\nOfficers found the handgun believed to have been used in the shooting outside the apartment. The gun was reported stolen in May from a vehicle in east Santa Cruz, police said.\nClark said the suspect is a gang member, but that his affiliation was not thought to be a motive in the shooting.\nEvan Sernoffsky is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
