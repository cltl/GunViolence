He got hit in the shoulder when gunfire erupted outside.\nPaterson police said around 6 p.m., dinnertime, a quarrel near a nearby liquor store escalated to gunfire. One of the bullets struck the boy, who was sitting in his home on Rosa Parks Boulevard, police said.\nThe Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s office said the boy was not believed to be the intended target.\nA worker at the liquor store said gunfire happens all too often in the part of Paterson where the shooting happened.\n\u201cAt least four or five times a month \u2013 monthly,\u201d said Blvd Liquor Store employee Julio Munoz. \u201cI know because we live here.
