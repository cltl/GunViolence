The condition of the person who was critically injured was not known.\nA crowd of singing mourners filled the street east of the residence, in the 300 block of Cherry Street East, as officers from the Sisseton Police Department and Roberts County Sheriff\u2019s Department carried bodies into a van. To the west of the residence, two women cried behind the police tape.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame,\u201d said William Ryan, 51, as he took a break from sawing wood a block away from where the shooting took place. \u201cOne of them was a classmate of my son\u2019s.\u201d\nRyan, who lives nearby in Browns Valley, Minn., said the last similar shooting incident he could recall was perhaps 20 years ago.\n\u201cFortunately, it doesn\u2019t happen very often,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should never happen.\u201d\nA burst of gunshots woke up Dan Shinerock early Saturday morning, the 51-year-old said as he stood in front of his home, just a few steps away from the police tape blocking Cherry Street East, where investigators worked throughout the day.\n\u201cI got woke up to boom, boom, boom, boom,\u201d Shinerock said. When he ran outside after calling 911, he saw a body hanging out of a car outside the residence where the shooting happened, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a depressing place to live,\u201d he said of his city. \u201cYou\u2019re trapped in your house all winter long, and it has a high suicide rate.\u201d\nDespite the shooting, Shinerock still feels safe in his neighborhood.\n\u201cI think it was an isolated incident,\u201d he said.\nDetails about the shooting remained sparse Saturday. Sisseton Police and the Roberts County Sheriff\u2019s Office declined to comment and referred questions to the DCI.\nDCI spokeswoman Sara Rabern said the DCI responded to the scene at about 3 a.m. Saturday morning. She declined to say if the deceased were related.\nThe state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office had asked early Saturday for the public\u2019s help locating Arbach, who was described as armed and dangerous. It later said Arbach was among the dead found at the scene and the public was not in danger.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know where he was\u201d at first, Rabern said. Once authorities analyzed the crime scene, they were able to determine that Arbach was one of the dead, she said.\nInvestigators are continuing to locate other individuals who may have been at the scene at the time of the shooting for their involvement or their eyewitness account.\nThe investigation is ongoing. Agencies assisting include the Sisseton Police Department, Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribal Police, Roberts County Sheriff\u2019s Office, South Dakota Highway Patrol, South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks and the DCI.\nCurtis Bird and Annie Durkin were taking a walk up Third Avenue East when they stopped to reflect on the shooting.\nBird, 14, described it as \u201ckind of a shock.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s such a small town,\u201d Durkin, 13, explained.\nBut neither teenager appeared fazed by what happened just a block away.\n\u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d Bird said with confidence. \u201cI know how to take care of myself.\u201d\nA group of people who answered the door at a house listed for Arbach declined to comment for this story."}
