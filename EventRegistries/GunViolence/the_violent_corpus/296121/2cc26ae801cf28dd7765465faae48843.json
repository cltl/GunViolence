Both the sheriff and deputy were taken to Northeast Georgia Medical Center for treatment, according to Capt. Mark Perry with the Georgia State Patrol.\n\u201cAs EMS and law enforcement arrived, he started shooting at Habersham County Sheriff\u2019s deputies,\u201d Perry said. \u201cTwo have been wounded. At this point it doesn\u2019t appear serious.\u201d\nTerrell was released from the hospital at about 11 p.m. Sunday, Channel 2 Action News reported.\nGiaquinta, a former City of Gainesville officer who had been fired, shot and killed his wife and then shot Terrell and Zigan, according to the GBI. Giaquinta and another man were both found dead late Sunday. It was not known whether Giaquinta shot himself.\nEarly information released indicated Giaquinta was a former Habersham County deputy, but that information was later retracted.\nThe incident happened around 7:30 p.m., just outside of Clarkesville, according to the GSP. Terrell responded to the incident because he knew Giaquinta and believed he could help assist, Channel 2 reported early Monday.\nThe GBI and other law enforcement agencies are assisting with the investigation.\nHabersham County is located about 85 miles northeast of Atlanta."}
