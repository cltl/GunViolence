Brad Liles of the Albany Police Department.\nLiles added that the incident remains under investigation, and that includes the motive of the suspect.\nPolice evacuated and closed down Pacific Boulevard between Waverly Drive and Columbus Street for more than an hour during the incident.\nNearby blocks also were barricaded by police to keep motorists and pedestrians away from Pacific Boulevard, and Waverly Elementary School was put in a lockdown.\nAt about 11:47 a.m., police heard a shot from inside the location and then an additional shot rang out several minutes later, according to an APD news release. Two hostages exited the store and reported the suspect had shot himself.\nPolice used a loudspeaker to try to communicate with anyone still inside at about 12:15 p.m. \u201cPick up the phone and call 9-1-1,\u201d and officer said.\n\u201cPlease come to the front door with your hands above your head,\u201d the officer added, moments later.\nA robot was sent inside Santiam Liquor to survey the scene, and at about 12:25 p.m., at least four members of Linn Regional SWAT, including an officer with a riot shield, went into the business and located the suspect inside.\nLiles said that the gap of about a half-hour between the shots fired and police entering the building was due to safety precautions. Authorities didn\u2019t want to rush in and put themselves or others in danger.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure no one else is in there. \u2026 Even though the hostages came out and said the suspect had shot himself, that\u2019s good information, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s deceased or he still couldn\u2019t be a threat,\u201d Liles said.\nLiles couldn\u2019t recall a similar hostage situation in Albany.\nAbout 20 public safety automobiles, including two armored vehicles, were in the vicinity of Pacific Highway during the incident.\nDozens of residents watched the police activity along Fourth Avenue S.E., Waverly Drive and other nearby streets, with some taking photographs with their cellular phones.\nThose with information about the case should contact Detective Dan Jones at 541-917-7686."}
