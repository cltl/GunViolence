Harrison added there could be more than one shooter.\nPolice are still working to identify if the child was related to either of the victims.\n\"It's heartbreaking,\" said Chief Harrison of children being victims of violence. \"It rips communities apart, it rips families apart. Some people never recover from that. We know all too well what's it's like to lose children in the community.\"\nHarrison added that the infant was in surgery.\n\"We don't know the condition of this infant,\" he said. \"What we're hopeful is that the infant will recover.\"\nNo suspect or motive has been released at this time, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\"What we need is for people that know what happened to call us and call Crimestoppers, so that we can do our job and hold these people accountable for what they did.\"\nAnyone with information about this shooting is asked to call Crimestoppers at 504 822-1111.\nSuperintendent Harrison speaks about tonight's shooting in Algiers and an infant being injured. @WWLTV pic.twitter.com/SJBiK1uYZf\n\u2014 Caresse Jackman (@CaresseJ) October 21, 2016\n(\u00a9 2017 WWL)"}
