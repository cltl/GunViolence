They didn't say how the other child got access to the gun.\nBannock County Prosecutor Steve Herzog says he thinks the gun must have been loaded and in a location where the child could find it. He says such a situation creates unreasonable and foreseeable risks.\nThe Lishes' attorney did not comment on Wednesday."}
