Young Ja\u2019Mecca was dead inside and her father \u2014 25-year-old Demarqo Smith \u2014 was not there. Authorities said he briefly fled the scene before returning to speak with detectives.\nOn Sunday, they announced the father had been arrested and charged with involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct. He is being held at the Fulton County jail without bond.\nFew other details about the case have been released.\n\u201cIt was a child,\u201d neighbor Ellis Jackson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy to happen to the family.\u201d\nThe same tragedy has befallen at least three other Georgia families since mid-October.\n\u2022 On Oct. 17, 8-year-old Sharia Lynch was killed inside her family\u2019s Paulding County home. Her mother, Marsha, told investigators a handgun had fallen and discharged when it hit the floor.\nThe same bullet struck Sharia in the head and her mother in the leg.\n\u2022 On Oct. 27, a 2-year-old Acworth boy shot himself inside his family\u2019s home after finding a semi-automatic handgun on a bed. The boy\u2019s father, Grant Dennington, and 4-year-old brother were also home at the time of the shooting, though neither was injured.\n\u2022 On Nov. 11, 2-year-old Jayden Jamar Clay was shot in the lip and killed after finding a .45-caliber handgun while playing with his twin brother inside their Butts County home. His mother\u2019s boyfriend, Christopher Dwayne Askins, was later charged with second-degree cruelty to children and weapons charges.\nAccording to a database maintained by advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, a total of 15 Georgia children have been injured or killed in accidental shootings in 2015. Also included is the August death of 25-year-old Douglas resident Dorothy Rearden, who was shot and killed by her 4-year-old son.\nEarlier this month, Dr. Viviana Goldenberg, a member of the Georgia chapter of Moms Demand Action, told The AJC that shootings like these come down to negligence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally terrifying, and this is happening all over the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no gun owner responsibility. They\u2019re not thinking of what measures to do to prevent access of the children to the gun.\u201d"}
