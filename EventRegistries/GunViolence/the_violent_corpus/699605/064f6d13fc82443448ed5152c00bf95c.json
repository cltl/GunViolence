A man and another woman, also believed to be injured in the shooting, are being treated.\nPolice shut down the intersection of Moncrief Road and Myrtle Avenue North Sunday night while investigating the shooting.\nAt 6:07 p.m., JSO got a call from the Lil' Albert Food Store reporting that there had been a shooting, said Ron Lendvay, JSO director of investigations and homeland security.\nA short time later, police got a duplicate call about the shooting from Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department Station 18 at 3504 Myrtle Ave. North.\nFire Station 18 told police that multiple people who had been shot were driven to the fire station. In that car were two women, a man and an infant, who were all shot. One of those women was pronounced dead at the fire station while the man, the other woman and the infant were taken to UF Health Jacksonville.\nThe infant and the other woman were pronounced dead at the hospital, Lendvay said. The man is being treated for his injuries, though his condition was not known as of late Sunday night.\nAnother woman later showed up at UF Health Jacksonville with a gunshot wound and her wound is believed to be related to this shooting. Her condition was also not available as of late Sunday night.\n\"It's a sad day for Jacksonville. It's a sad day for everyone who lives in this area, and it's a sad day for everyone investigating this terrible crime,\" Lendvay said.\nJacksonville police identified the victims of the shooting as Xacia Burnem, 18, Kadejah Williams, 22, and 11-month-old Tedashi Williams.\nInvestigators believe the shooting may stem from a disagreement that happened earlier Sunday between some females.\nPolice said there was at least one shooter, but they have not ruled out the possibility that there was more than one, Lendvay said. A handgun is believed to have been used in the shooting.\nLendvay said at this point it is too early to release suspect information as police are still conducting interviews and want to ensure the information they release is correct.\nInvestigators also think there could possibly be more victims from the shooting. Lendvay said anyone who witnessed the shooting or anyone who was a victim is asked to contact the JSO Homicide Unit at (904) 630-0500 or CrimeStoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS.\nAction News Jax is following the story.
