Lancaster will have to serve at least three years in prison and the rest of the sentence will be left up to Ambrose, defense attorney Stephen McGowan said.\nLancaster and Stull were inside Lancaster's Ridge Road apartment in Brooklyn getting ready to paint when Lancaster put a gun to Stull's back with the intent to have it make a clicking sound.\nLancaster told police he took the magazine out of the handgun and thought that would prevent the gun from firing, according to court records.\nThe gun had one bullet in the chamber and Lancaster shot Stull in the back. Stull was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.\nLancaster called Brooklyn police immediately after the shooting and said he shot his roommate, police said. Lancaster and Stull had not been drinking or taking drugs, McGowan said.\nMcGowan said Lancaster was \"seriously emotionally affected\" by the shooting and never meant for anything bad to happen.\n\"It was totally unintentional but it was a horrible situation,\" McGowan said.\nIf you'd like to comment on this story, visit Monday's crime and courts comments section."}
