A car believed to be with the shooter also pulled up on the opposite side of the group, almost boxing the victims in, and also began firing.\nThe first victim was pronounced dead on the scene, while the other victims were rushed to area hospitals for treatment. One of them is said to be in critical condition while the other four are stable.\nNone of the victims have been identified, but police say their ages range from 18 to 23 years old. All the victims are male.\nPolice say despite the large crowd out at the time of the shooting, so far no one claims to have seen or heard anything.\nPolice Commissioner Charles Ramsey said Monday morning that detectives will look to see if Sunday night\u2019s shooting is retaliation from a previous murder in the area.\n\u201cThere was a homicide there in late September, at least in that area. We don\u2019t know if any of the victims were alleged to have been a part of that, if that had something to do with it, or if this is a different kind of dispute.\u201d\nPolice say they don\u2019t have any suspects identified.\nThe shooting remains under investigation."}
