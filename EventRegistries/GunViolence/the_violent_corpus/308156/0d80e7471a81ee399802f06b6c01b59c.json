Eric Reece said Monday night that the suspect, identified as William R. Williams, 51, appeared to have shot his son, Brodie, 4, and his daughter, Marley, 2, and then himself. The Missouri State Highway Patrol, one of several law enforcement agencies that assisted in the confrontation, previously said the suspect was a civilian patrol employee in the early 1990s, but it would provide no other details.\nSpringfield police arrived at the apartment complex about 9:30 p.m. Sunday (10:30 p.m. ET) after they received a call asking them to check on the family. Williams was armed and refused to let them in, police said. Negotiations then proceeded for almost a full day as armed law enforcement officers ringed the building, even at one point sending in a robot to assess the scene.\nReece wouldn't describe how police entered the unit in detail, but he said several loud bangs heard by reporters Monday were related to their entrance. The building remained sealed Monday night, and no further information will be made public until Tuesday at the earliest, Reece said.\nSOCIAL\nBarricade update on S.
