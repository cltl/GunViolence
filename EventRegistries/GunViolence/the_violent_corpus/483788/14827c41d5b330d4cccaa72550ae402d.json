It\u2019s been a stressful week for me.\u201d\nBrown has been arrested two other times \u2014 and both of those were bogus arrests, his relatives and court papers say.\nThe first time the Coney Island native was arrested was back on May 9, 2007, when he was walking home after a day of work at his neighborhood Pathmark.\nBrown was stopped by officers and arrested on drug possession charges. The charges were later dropped, and Brown sued for false arrest. The city settled his claim for $30,000.\nHe was arrested again this past Nov. 1, when police identified him as one of the 16 looters who ripped off a Neptune Ave. Key Food after Hurricane Sandy.\nBrown was spotted walking out of the Key Food \u201ccarrying property\u201d about midnight on Halloween, the criminal complaint says. He was charged with felony burglary, misdemeanor criminal trespass and petty larceny.\nThe burglary charge was later dismissed, and Brown\u2019s cousin Donald Franks predicted the other charges would be dropped as well.\n\u201cHe was just out there looking for his nephew,\u201d Franks said.\nBrown said he doesn\u2019t understand why the cops keep arresting him. \u201cI did feel targeted, and I didn\u2019t understand why this was being done to me. I just couldn\u2019t understand it. But I\u2019m home now, and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cMy family\u2019s still behind me, from day one, and if it wasn\u2019t for them, I\u2019d probably still be sitting inside there now.\u201d\nRelatives predicted that Brown would be filing suit \u2014 but now he has far more serious charges hanging over his head.\nBrown said he was playing Call of Duty: Black Ops at a friend\u2019s home on March 22 when he heard there had been a shooting at the home of a longtime family friend, Eva Natal. The gunman and a female accomplice had shot Natal, two of her sons and another man, Angel Rivera, before fleeing the Gravesend Houses apartment. Rivera was killed in the bloody attack.\nBrown\u2019s family and friends said he soon received more shocking news \u2014 police had identified him as the gunman.\n\u201cHe was with us the whole time,\u201d said his friend Shawna Brown, who\u2019s no relation. Friends and family were in disbelief when they saw Brown\u2019s face pop up on the news. \u201cHe was watching things unfold as we were,\u201d Shawna Brown said.\nWith the help of his brother and father, Joseph Brown surrendered to the police.\nBrown and several other witnesses spoke to investigators, and told them that he was with them at the time of the 3:30 p.m. shooting.\nBrown was slapped with murder and other charges, and locked up for a week before prosecutors consented to his release on Friday. They said they were \u201cstill investigating to make sure we have the correct individual in custody.\u201d\nHe\u2019s due back in court on May 29.\nBrown\u2019s family said that one of the victims of the shooting is legally blind, and might have thought Brown was the shooter because the suspect had braids like Brown used to have.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s always slandering this kid,\u201d Shawna Brown said. \u201cThis man never killed a roach. He doesn\u2019t have it in him.\u201d\nWith Jennifer H. Cunningham"}
