(WSYR-TV)\nSyracuse Police have released the name of the man who was fatally shot early Thanksgiving morning in Armory Square.\nAccording to police, staff at The Bar kicked out two men for getting into a minor physical altercation around 1:00 a.m., pushing them out into the streets.\nThe two continued the dispute on the street, when, according to police, 28-year-old Sangsouriyanh Maniphonh shot two rounds at 26-year-old Jonathan Diaz.\nDiaz was struck in the chest. He was transported to the hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries.\nSyracuse Police Chief Frank Fowler said the suspect is a legal gun owner, but that \"alcohol and guns don't mix.\"\nThe two appeared to have had some history, but police are still looking into the incident.\nThere was a heavy police presence in the area, since the night before Thanksgiving is one of the city's most popular nights for locals to go out drinking, aside from St. Patrick's Day.\nOfficers arrested the suspect about two minutes after the shots rang out.\nThe suspect sustained an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound to the hand.\nManiphonh, a military veteran, was charged with second-degree murder and could be facing 25 years to life if convicted.\nInvestigators are asking anyone with information to give them a call at 442-5222. All calls will be kept confidential.\nWatch the press conference below:\nCopyright 2017 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
