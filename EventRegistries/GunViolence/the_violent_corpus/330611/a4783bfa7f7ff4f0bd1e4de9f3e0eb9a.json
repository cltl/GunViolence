After that, the police came.\u201d\nRobles died of natural causes on April 16.\nTo view this page ensure that Adobe Flash Player version 10.2.0 or greater is installed.\nHe was a \u201cformer gang member\u201d who did time in prison and may have been affiliated with the Bloods, police sources said.\n\u201cRival gang members heard about the funeral and decided to start shooting the place up,\u201d a police source said.\nAngela Diggs, 50, was worshiping at another church when gunfire \u2014 which was picked up by the NYPD\u2019s new ShotSpotter system -- rang out.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come out,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just continued praying for whatever was happening out there. Praying that nobody died.\u201d\nBut when the smoke cleared, two men were dead, police said. Four others, including two women, were wounded.\n\u201cI saw two guys on the floor, right in front of the church,\u201d said witness Jose Donate, 54. \u201cThe cops tried to do CPR, but it looked like they were already dead. (The cops) were pumping them. They said \u2018Come on, come on, breathe!\u2019 \u201d\nThe dead included a 44-year-old man who was hit in the chest and a 40-year-old man who took a bullet to the stomach, officials said. Neither was identified.\nBoth died at Kings County Hospital, according to authorities.\nA second 40-year-old man \u2014 believed to be one of the gunmen \u2014 was found shot in the stomach five blocks away in a vehicle on E. 32nd St. and Farragut Road. His accomplices had vanished.\nOther victims included a 38-year-old woman shot in the leg, a 37-year-old man shot in the hand and a 29-year-old woman who showed up at Kings County Hospital a half hour later, shot in the leg.\nSome witnesses said the shooting took place after a fight broke out as people waited outside to pay their respects.\n\u201cThis was about something that happened 20 years ago and had nothing to do with Robles,\u201d a source close to the investigation said. \u201c(The shooter) confronts one of the victims and gets punched. That guy\u2019s friend pulls a gun and starts shooting.\u201d\nOne of the dead men had jumped in front of his wife as the gunman started shooting, the source said. His wife suffered critical injuries.\nCommunity leaders were outraged by the gunplay.\n\u201cThis again proves that there are too many guns on the streets in the hands of people who have no regard for human life,\u201d said community activist Tony Herbert, founder of the One Family, One Community Initiative, an anti-violence campaign where stakeholders from community, religious and business groups work together to steer kids away from gangs and violence. \u201cThis is definitely a call for the mayor to get on board with our agenda.\u201d\nRobles\u2019 relatives did not believe the shooting was connected to their dearly departed family member.\n\u201cWhatever was happening, it had nothing to do with the funeral,\u201d said Alcides Perez, 31, Robles\u2019 nephew and an Iraq War veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\u201cI was outside getting fresh air, and I ended up seeing something worse. It reminded me a lot of Iraq.\u201d\nNo arrests were immediately made.\nON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH VIDEO HERE."}
