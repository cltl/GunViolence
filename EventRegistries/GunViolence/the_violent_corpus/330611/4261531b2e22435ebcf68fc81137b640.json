Mourners had gathered there for the funeral of 38-year-old Jose Luis Robles, who had died of natural causes.\nPolice said 15 rounds were fired, and some came from within the church vestibule.\nInvestigators on Tuesday were looking at whether the shooting was a gang-related retaliation, examining surveillance video and interviewing witnesses.\nThe street in front of the church was blocked off Tuesday as elected officials, community organizers and pastors gathered for a rally across Flatbush Avenue.\nCouncilman Jumaane Williams, whose district includes East Flatbush, said he will push for funding for jobs so young people won't be on the streets.\n\"We must find jobs for our young people. It's summertime, almost. I want my young people to have work experience and to be extremely tired at the end of the day,\" he said.\nHe and Borough President Eric Adams urged the media not to describe the shootings as gang related. They said that may spur retaliatory violence.\nFocusing on gang affiliations tends to suggest that someone is not worthy, he said, adding \"all life is worthy of being honored.\"\nSharieff Clayton, 40, of the Bronx, and Ronald Murphy, 44, of Brooklyn, were killed. A 38-year-old woman and a 29-year-old woman were also struck and were listed in stable condition early Tuesday. It's not clear whether those injured were intended targets, or random victims.\nA 40-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the stomach was discovered a few blocks away and may be one of the gunmen on the street, police said.\nSeveral cars sped away after the shooting and no arrests have been made. Police said a silver vehicle seen near the church was stopped in a different Brooklyn neighborhood.\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC New York"}
