Stephen Cronin said.\nSchmidt, who has a gun permit, cooperated with police and admitted the wound to \"the meaty part of his hand,\" was his own fault.\n\"He was manipulating the gun, whether he was doing maintenance or checking it,\" said Cronin. \"He dropped a magazine and it looked like it was moving the slide and it discharged. It went through the meaty part of his hand and lodged in the carpet.\"\nPolice went to the home and discovered the gun that he shot himself with, as well as several other guns. Cronin said police are counting the number of guns Schmidt has and will confiscate them if they have not already.\nSchmidt was not arrested and will be summoned to appear in Framingham District Court at a later date, Cronin said.\nNorman Miller can be reached at 508-626-3823 or nmiller@wickedlocal.com.
