They believe Andrews shot and killed Copeland before shooting himself.\n\"I don't know how it got to that point,\" Copeland's father, Jermaine Carroll, told CBS46. \"But it did happen. And I just, I'm kind of lost\nfor words at the moment. I met him only one time.\"\nCopeland's mother says the two were close friends.\n\"The little young fellow that took her life, took my daughter's life and his own life, that was her best friend,\" said Tuwanna Copeland. \"He couldn't live without her, he didn't want no body else to live with her if he couldn't have her to himself.\"\nThe bodies of the juveniles have been transported to the GBI crime lab for an autopsy and at that point, police said they should know more about exactly what happened.\n\"He was a sweet, kind, loving grandson,\" Andrews' grandmother told a CBS46 reporter. \"He was a good kid, a good student.\"\nWhen asked about the couple's relationship, Andrews' grandmother said \"I never met her.\"\nThe motive for the incident is still undetermined and under investigation.\nCopyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).
