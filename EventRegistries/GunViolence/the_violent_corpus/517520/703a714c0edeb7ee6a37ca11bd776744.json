Randy Meisner, 69, told police that his wife was shot as she searched for something in the closet, RadarOnline reports.\nLaw enforcement had been to the Meisner residence earlier in the evening, several news outlets say. Lana Rae Meisner, 63, allegedly called 911 to report a domestic violence incident, according to TMZ, which also claims that she accused Randy Meisner of \u201cacting erratically.\u201d Roughly an hour and a half later, Randy Meisner called to say his wife had gone into another room when he heard a gun shot, according to multiple reports.\nRadarOnline quotes an unnamed law enforcement source who describes a grisly scene. According to that source, Meisner told the police that his wife \u201cwas stumbling around, looking for something in a closet where there were two guns. She was looking for something in the hall closet, and Randy told cops one of the guns was falling and in the process, Lana Rae caught it and it ended up blowing her head apart.\u201d\nTMZ earlier reported that Meisner was \u201cacting in an altered state\u201d when police arrived, and apparently was taken to the hospital. \u201cRandy seemed to be in shock,\u201d Page Six says, \u201cand wasn\u2019t even able to acknowledge that Lana Rae was dead from a gunshot wound.\u201d\nThe Meisner\u2019s marriage made headlines last spring when Randy Meisner refuted a TMZ story claiming Lana Rae wanted to kill him. She\u2019d been accused in that same report of keeping Randy in a \u201cstate of near-constant inebriation\u201d because \u201che is easier to control when he\u2019s drunk.\u201d Later, in June, Randy was placed under 24-hour care by a temporary conservator following a court hearing in which Meisner was alleged to have threatened to shoot hospital staff and also to end his own life by taking all of his medication.\nMeisner left the Eagles in 1977; he was earlier in Poco."}
