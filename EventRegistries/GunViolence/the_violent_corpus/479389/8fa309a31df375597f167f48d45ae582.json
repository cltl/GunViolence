Tom Hansen said that after the verbal exchange, the suspects drove by again and fired multiple rounds, striking the four boys.\nAll were taken to area hospitals to be treated for their wounds, which were serious but not life-threatening.\nHansen said that while the exchange about the clothing leads police to believe the shooting may have been gang-motivated, investigators have no reason to think any of the victims are involved with a gang.\n\u201cThere was some conversation between the victims and the suspects. Some of the words the suspects used leads us to believe that it could have gang motivated,\u201d Brentwood Police Department Captain Tom Hanson told KCBS.\n\u201cHowever, we have no reason to believe that the victims are engaged in gang activity, affiliated, or gang members at all,\u201d said Hanson.\nHe said that although Brentwood is \u201cnot immune\u201d to gang activity, it is rare in the town of about 52,000.\n\u201cThis is something that doesn\u2019t happen often in Brentwood, so obviously we\u2019re shocked and we\u2019re going to work diligently to identify who did this,\u201d Hansen said.\nAn investigation into the shooting is under way and police are attempting to identify witnesses that might lead them to the suspects.\nA description of the suspects was not immediately available. Police have described their vehicle as a white or light-colored, late-model four-door sedan.\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Brentwood police Detective Aguirre at (925) 809-7726 or Detective Folena at (925) 809-7743.\n(Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.
