Fuller was already critically injured with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nDeputies found him outside his front door. They also found a weapon that had been hidden in the house by Fuller\u2019s wife and likely was used to fire on his sons, according to the report.\nThe bodies of Uriah Fuller, 4, and his brother, Josiah Fuller, 3, lay inside the house. They suffered multiple gunshot wounds, Campbell said in the report.\nWhile only one gun was found in the home, Fuller and others frequently fired guns in the backyard, neighbors told the Observer.\nNeighbor Ronnie Patterson said Fuller had high-powered rifles as well as handguns. He said Fuller and others shot at targets such as milk jugs and cans and that several trees in the yard were damaged from the shooting.\nSometimes Fuller drank alcohol while shooting, and sometimes the children or others were there while the shooting took place, Patterson said.\nThe shooting next door was so common and disturbing, Patterson said, that his girlfriend had moved out of the house.\nJoe Marusak: 704-358-5067, @jmarusak"}
