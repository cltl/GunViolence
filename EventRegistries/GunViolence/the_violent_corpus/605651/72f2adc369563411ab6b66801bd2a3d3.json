Channel 11\u2019s Courtney Brennan reported that the girl\u2019s father seemed upset and agitated, leaving the courtroom several times during testimony.\nDefense attorney Blaine Jones said his client, Thomas, never meant to kill anyone.\nAuthorities said Thomas was on Sarah Street in Knoxville the night of July 17 to act as \"security\" for a girl fight. Prosecutors said Thomas spotted a man who allegedly had a gun and threatened him.\n\"That gentleman had threatened my client in the past and was threatening him that night as well,\u201d Jones said.\nPolice said Thomas told investigators he got a gun and fired it toward the house where the man was, intending to scare him. The gun, though, went off several times and hit Isis in the head as she played in the front yard.\n\"I think it's a nightmare for the entire community,\u201d Jones said.\nAll five charges filed against Thomas were held for court."}
