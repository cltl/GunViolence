Dave Garrido.\nA person inside the Camry returned fire at Williams, who was in the passenger seat of a red Nissan Altima.\nThe driver of the Nissan took Williams to a nearby fire station, at South Main Street and East 108th Street. Williams was found dead inside the car. The driver fled.\nAnthony Alonzo Cudger, 25, was arrested June 14 on suspicion of killing Williams, but he released June 17.\nProsecutors declined to file charges because the investigation found that Cudger acted in self-defense, said Greg Risling, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County district attorney.\nThe shooting was the latest in an ongoing feud between two street gangs \u2013 the Main Street Crips and the Hoover Crips, authorities said.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Criminal Gang Homicide Division at (213) 485-1383.
