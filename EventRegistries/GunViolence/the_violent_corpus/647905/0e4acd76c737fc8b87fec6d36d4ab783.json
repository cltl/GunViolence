The bullet went through the relative\u2019s wall and into a neighbor\u2019s apartment.\nBallistics evidence from the two scenes implicated Moise, who was first arrested for drunken driving around 8 a.m. Monday while behind the wheel of a 2002 Ford Explorer with a missing wheel and a broken axle, cops said.\nMoise fired his 9-mm. Glock around four hours earlier at the tail end of the annual celebration, striking Tiarah Poyau above her right eye from close range on a Crown Heights street, police said.\n\u201cI think I shot somebody on the parade route,\u201d cops quoted Moise as telling a friend after squeezing off the shot that ended Poyau\u2019s promising young life. \u201cI didn\u2019t know the gun was loaded.\u201d\nThe globe-trotting 22-year-old victim, who had just finished a summer internship at PricewaterhouseCoopers, died a short time later at Kings County Hospital.\nBut cops said Moise\u2019s wild night of random gunfire wasn\u2019t done yet.\nThe boozed-up Brooklyn man called his cousin, looking to ditch the murder weapon in her Montgomery St. apartment, police sources said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too hot,\u201d he reportedly said of the 9-mm. handgun.\nNeighbor Nadia Bryan was awake to check on her baby in their fourth-floor apartment when she heard two gunshots coming from next door.\nOne bullet then tore through the wall of her apartment, directly above her child\u2019s crib.\n\u201cIt was by the grace of God that I wasn\u2019t hurt or my son wasn\u2019t hurt,\u201d said Bryan, 30.\nMoise was charged with second-degree murder, criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment. He had five previous sealed arrests on his rap sheet, police sources said.\nWalberto Perez, 23, a high school friend of the dead woman, said the fatal shooting was senseless.\n\u201cShe was a really great girl,\u201d said Perez. \u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d\nThe casings found in the apartment on Montgomery St. resembled those found on the street at the murder scene, and were later matched at the NYPD crime lab.\n\u201cThe aluminum jacket we recovered at that scene was the same as the crime scene on Empire Blvd.,\u201d confirmed NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce.\nThe gunman left his pistol behind at the apartment before bolting. And he couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\n\u201cHe makes statements to two people that implicate himself, and he makes statements to my detectives as well that he did not know the gun was loaded,\u201d the chief added.\nMoise also smashed a mirror with his hand while in the apartment, and had a flag from a Caribbean nation wrapped around his bleeding hand when arrested.\nCops said the suspect slammed the Explorer into several parked cars, and was slurring his speech and struggling to stay upright when arrested.\nA woman in the apartment where Moise had dumped the weapon called police around 11 a.m., and the pieces soon fell into place. Moise was in custody for about three hours before investigators realized their DWI suspect was also a possible murderer.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good boy. This surprised our whole family,\u201d a woman claiming to be a relative of the suspected shooter said as she waited outside the 70th Precinct Tuesday. \u201cWe believe this is a case of mistaken identity or maybe one of his friends did it and he took the blame.\n\u201cThis will get resolved, and I truly, truly know it was not him,\u201d she added.\nA neighbor of the Poyau family hailed the police for the arrest, and wondered what was going through the suspect\u2019s mind.\n\u201cWhy would you bring a gun to a parade?\u201d asked Anna Jackson, 57. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have fun, not shoot people.\u201d\nCops remained stumped Tuesday in the second J\u2019Ouvert murder, the shooting of a 17-year-old boy who walked over to a bench and sat down \u2014 unaware that he was shot near the intersection of Flatbush Ave. and Empire Blvd. Tyreke Borel died at 5:11 a.m. at Kings County Hospital."}
