He was 88.\nMr. Correll, from humble beginnings, amassed a huge fortune; he was a millionaire many times over. A philanthropist, generous to a fault, he gave thousands to charities and youth organizations. The Correll family donated land to Somerset Christian School and is a noted benefactor of University of the Cumberlands (UC) in Williamsburg.\nBut, before all that, Mr. Correll and his family turned the key that opened business and commercial growth in Somerset and Pulaski County.\nMr. Correll built Tradewind shopping center in the mid-1960s, triggering a migration of downtown businesses to the Truck Route, local name for the recently four-laned U.S. 27. At the time, there were about four businesses \u2013\u2013 Standard Armature, Cornett\u2019s Machine Shop, Family Drive-In Theater and the popular Finley\u2019s Drive-In Restaurant \u2013\u2013 along an eight-mile stretch of U.S. 27 between Somerset and Burnside. Now, U.S. 27 is \u201crestaurant row,\u201d the eateries sporadically spaced among innumerable business and commercial outlets.\nTradewind, anchored by Rose\u2019s 50,000-square-foot shopping experience, was a \u201cwow!\u201d Its glittering shopping aisles were something out of this world for tiny little Somerset with its mostly Mom and Pop type retail outlets.\nMr. Correll loved to tell the story about his shy trip to Rose\u2019s corporate headquarters; how he convinced them to move and expand their downtown Somerset Rose\u2019s to the Tradewind.\nTradewind was a magnet. Businesses began moving to U.S. 27 to take advantage of traffic generated by Rose\u2019s and adjacent stores in the strip shopping center.\nA new advertising base created by Mr. Correll\u2019s Tradewind was a dream come true for George Joplin III and Mrs. Murray K. Rogers, publishers of The Commonwealth and the Somerset Journal. On January 3, 1966, the two weekly newspapers merged into the Commonwealth Journal and began publishing daily. It wouldn\u2019t have happened then, maybe never, had it not been for Mr. Correll\u2019s Tradewind shopping center.\nA few years later, Blaine Correll, the quiet but influential brother of Ward Correll, built Grand Central Place, a big-city-like shopping complex on the south side of U.S. 27. Somerset was on its way to \u201cthe growingest city\u201d in Southeastern Kentucky.\nThe late Mr. Correll, with a Bible verse on the tip of his tongue, had a sense of humor. He was a member of \u201cThe $250,000 Club\u201d that met daily for coffee at Somerset Lodge, one of Somerset\u2019s first nice motel and restaurant. Fellow members were the late W.O. \u201cBill\u201d Newell, Clelland Prewitt, Linville Tarter (Mr. Correll\u2019s brother-in-law) and others. Qualifications for a member of \u201cThe $250,000 Club:\u201d Have $250,000 or owe $250,000.\nMr. Correll was on black side of the ledger. He had $250,000 and more, due to fantastic success of his Cumberland Lake Shell oil distributorship and other business ventures.\nOften, in his familiar hat, Mr. Correll would greet friends with a dance and wave. A country ham was his favorite way of saying thank-you.\nWard Correll is a household name across Southcentral Kentucky. He has been a financial benefactor to scores of churches, charities, sports teams and organizations including Somerset Christian School \u2014 a monument on the school campus memorializes his family\u2019s contribution of land for the school \u2014 and the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg where the Ward and Regina Correll Science Complex is named in honor of him and his late wife who died June 7, 2008. In 2014, Correll was recipient of the Somerset-Pulaski County\u2019s Distinguished Community Service Award.\nA native Kentuckian, Correll, one of 13 children, was born in nearby Wayne County.\n\u201cBasic living necessities \u2013 food, clothing and shoes \u2013 were meager,\u201d Correll wrote of his biographical account of his life.\nAfter graduating from high school, with $2.67 in his pocket, he hitch-hiked to Detroit to \u201cmake a living.\u201d Mowing lawns to pay for room and board, he swept a warehouse to buy necessities while looking for a permanent job.\nAfter serving his country with the U.S. Army in an intelligence unit during the Korean War, he returned home to Somerset where he married his late wife, the former Regina Tarter. As a couple, their first business was selling bananas in Pittsburgh, Pa. From those humble beginnings he built his business empire.\nOne of Mr. Correll\u2019s favorite philanthropic gifts is the Ward Correll Sports Complex, located in Somerset, where replicas of the Liberty Bell, an iconic symbol of American independence, are placed in testimony to Correll\u2019s love of country.\nMr. Correll has received many accolades, including the 2002 Kentuckian Award presented by the A.B. Chandler Foundation. He was named Outstanding Philanthropist by the Association of Fundraising Professionals Bluegrass Chapter in 2003. Also, in 2003, Correll was presented the Business of the Year Award as the Entrepreneurial Success by Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of Commerce. He was recipient of the Hal Rogers Leadership Award in 2006.\nAnother building on the University of the Cumberlands campus has been named after the Corrells because of another contribution. In 2010, Correll pledged $1 million toward a $6.5 million facility to promote better health maintenance and improve quality of life not just for students but the community as well.\nThe 5,000-square-feet Ward Correll Health and Wellness Center opened last fall and was officially dedicated on Thursday.\nDr. Larry Cockrum, president of UC, told the Commonwealth Journal that Correll\u2019s son Kirk attended the ceremony in his father\u2019s stead.\n\u201cWe really wish he [Ward Correll] could have been there but we know his heart was there,\u201d Dr. Cockrum said. \u201cThe friendship he\u2019s had with the University has been tremendous. He really cared for young people and children\u2026What he did was not for his own glory but to help students help themselves.\u201d\nLake Cumberland Funeral Home is handling the arrangements for Mr. Correll, whose visitation will be from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Monday evening and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday at the First Baptist Church of Somerset.\nHis funeral will begin at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the church."}
