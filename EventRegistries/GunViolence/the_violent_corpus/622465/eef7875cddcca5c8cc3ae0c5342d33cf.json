Officials identified the boy as Delance Price, of the 6900 block of South Wabash Avenue.\nAfter the shooting, a handful of officers stood over the teen\u2019s body in the back of an overgrown vacant lot between two homes.\nNeighbors watched police from their porches as a helicopter hummed over the otherwise quiet block. One woman read a book while sitting on her porch. A man near the end of the block mowed lawns. Next to the vacant lot, two men on a porch shared a cigarette.\nZackariah\u2019s father, Victor Reed, 64, said he was inside his apartment making Kool-Aid when he heard the gunfire. He counted 12 to 14 gunshots that could have been fired from three different caliber guns, he said.\nA neighbor told Zackariah and his friend to get inside the gate of their apartment complex, Reed said. The children made it to Reed\u2019s apartment just as he was going outside to look for them.\n\u201cMy concern is all the kids being shot,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThat\u2019s what brought me to the window. I came out to look for my baby to make sure he was safe.\u201d\nThree other people have been killed in Chicago shootings since Friday morning.\nAbout 4:25 a.m. Saturday, a 29-year-old man was shot multiple times in the head and pronounced dead in the 11600 block of South Torrence Avenue in South Deering.
