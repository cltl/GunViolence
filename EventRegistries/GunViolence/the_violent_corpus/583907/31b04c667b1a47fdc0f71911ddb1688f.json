They are monitoring the pressure in his brain and keeping him in a medically induced coma so his brain can 'rest'.\nIf the pressure and swelling can be controlled with medication they will do so, surgery may be necessary at some point.\nHe is moving his right side. When he starts coming to, he tries to pull out the tubes etc. Movement is good, but we would love to see him move both sides.\nUPDATE:\nThe battle continues.\nIt is frightening.\nJett's little body has swelling that distorts his sweet face. The monitor in his brain alerts the staff about swelling. A respirator breaths for him to save his energy and keep his oxygen level up. His heart rate dropped and steps were taken to address that. He has had blood given.\nThe last thing we want this precious family to worry about are the doctor bills. If you aren't able to donate we understand but prayers are always free.\n#prayforjett"}
