Crime Stoppers is offering $2,500 in each case.\nShalita Hunter\nOn May 12 at 11:40 p.m., 25-year-old Shalita Hunter drove from her Southfield home to visit her boyfriend in Pontiac, according to the sheriff's office.\nBefore Hunter arrived, the boyfriend told authorities he had heard loud banging on his door. He grabbed his handgun and opened the door, and saw a light-skinned black male in the driveway holding a gun, according to authorities.\nHunter pulled up about the same time, at which point the light-skinned man allegedly fired his weapon.\nBy the time Hunter\u2019s boyfriend looked outside again, Hunter and the man weren't there, authorities say.\nAuthorities say a short time later, Hunter called her boyfriend on a cellphone. They talked, and he heard a man\u2019s voice on the phone, urging Hunter to tell him that she was safe. Twenty minutes later, Hunter was found dead, lying on the road. The next day, her car was found in a vacant lot on Tasmania. Police recovered a .380 spent shell casing on the floor board.\nAndre Shaw\nAndre Shaw, 36, died at a block party held the night before the Fourth of July, authorities said.\nShaw went to the block party, which was in the area of Michigan and Tasmania, and was held in honor of a friend who\u2019d returned home to visit. At some point in the night, two people \u201cnot believed to be attendees of the party\u201d started firing guns, the sheriff's office said. Police say they believe someone from the party may have joined in the shooting. The end result of it was a 36-year-old man dead.\nAniya Edwards\nAniya Edwards\u2019 death is another case of a homecoming gone wrong.\nThe 19-year-old was attending college in Tennessee when she returned in August to visit. Edwards and friends were at a party on Thorpe on Aug. 5, and at about 11 p.m. the group was hanging out in front of an empty house.\nThen a silver Chevy Cobalt drove past.\nWhen it reached the intersection of Liberty and Thorpe, the Cobalt hit a U-turn and drove back toward the assemblage, according to authorities. Then, \u201cseveral occupants of the vehicle,\u201d wearing ski masks, got out of the Cobalt and started shooting, according to the sheriff's office. Edwards was hit in her heart and died just after midnight.\nSpeak up\nAuthorities are asking anyone who has information on any of the three homicides to step forward and say what they know. Those who prefer anonymity can call Crime Stoppers of Michigan, whose call center is located in Windsor and has no caller ID, at 800-SPEAK-UP."}
