About a month and a half after the shooting, Anowlic-Okitkon is making a recovery that nobody expected.\nFrom her room inside Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage, Anowlic-Okitkon is slowly regaining strength, according to Testarmata who visits her regularly.\nAnowlic-Okitkon\u2019s motor skills are slowly returning. She\u2019s able to move her arms, but typing and finer movements are still difficult. In a recent phone interview Testarmata joked that Anowlic-Okitkon\u2019s grip is as strong as ever.\n\u201cShe\u2019s always pinning me down in thumb wrestling,\u201d Testarmata said, laughing.\nIt\u2019s still too early to tell the extent of any brain damage. It\u2019s also too early to say when or if Anowlic-Okitkon will be walking again. But she\u2019s getting better all the time.\n\u201cLast night, for the first time in a long time, I heard her voice,\u201d Testarmata told the Empire on Wednesday. \u201cShe could only whisper, but it was wonderful. I was so excited.\u201d\nAnowlic-Okitkon has been able to comprehend and communicate nonverbally with visitors and hospital workers for several weeks. Until Tuesday, she didn\u2019t have a voice to speak back. Anowlic-Okitkon isn\u2019t yet able to talk any louder than a whisper, and it\u2019s \u201ca faint whisper\u201d at that, according to Testarmata. But it\u2019s progress.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all thrilled because this is way more than we could hoped when we were worried if she was even going to live,\u201d she said.\nPolice investigation\nWhile Anowlic-Okitkon recovers in Anchorage, the Juneau Police Department is investigating the shooting that landed her there.\nJust before noon on Oct. 14, Anowlic-Okitkon was on the first floor of the Coho Park Apartment where she lived when somebody on the second story fired a gun pointed at the floor. The bullet traveled through the ceiling above Anowlic-Okitkon and struck her in the top of the head, according to police.\nShe lived in the apartment with her fianc\u00e9 Michael Flores, 20; his father, Rafael, 51; and Rafael\u2019s significant other Katherine Milton, 46, all of whom were in the apartment at the time of the shooting. Police have not said who fired the gun.\nAfter the shooting, the police department put out a release seeking the whereabouts of Milton and Rafael Flores. After finding and questioning the them, JPD released the couple the next day.\nPolice haven\u2019t yet charged anybody connected to the shooting with a crime, and whether they will remains to be determined, according to JPD spokesperson Lt. David Campbell.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly complicated case, and the detective is working pretty hard on it,\u201d he told the Empire in a phone interview Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWhether there are going to be charges or not is still up in the air.\u201d\nAccording to Juneau District Attorney James Scott, accidental shootings require an \u201cextremely highly fact specific analysis.\u201d Charges, Scott said, can vary in these cases depending on whether the shooting is deemed to be negligent, reckless or intentional. The outcome of the shooting also plays an important role in determining the severity of the charge.\nIn late August, a Juneau man accidentally shot a school bus carrying students after he \u201cdry fired\u201d a loaded handgun in his home. The bullet went through his front door and shattered a bus window. Nobody was injured, but JPD recommended to prosecutors a charge of shooting a firearm within a quarter mile of the road, a class B misdemeanor. Had a child on that bus been injured or killed, those charges could have been more severe.\n\u201cThese shootings run the gamut from no charge to serious charges, and what we need to know is exactly how the firearm was being used and under what circumstances,\u201d Scott said.\n\u2022 Contact reporter Sam DeGrave at 523-2279 or sam.degrave@juneauempire.com."}
