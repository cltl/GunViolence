The uncle was transported to UAB hospital and is in stable condition. His name is not being released at this time. Chief J.C. Poe said his department is investigating with the help of the Walker County Children's Advocacy Center. Leah Belser is the executive director, \"When a report of sexual abuse, neglect or witness to violence is made to law enforcement or the department of human resources is made, they call us.\" Belser is also the forensic interviewer who speaks with any child who comes through the door. \"To give them an opportunity to tell the story in their own words.\"{} The story police are trying to learn more about happened at 12:15 Saturday afternoon. Jasper police responded to a call at 24th street west. They found a 32-year-old male shot in the head -- allegedly by his five year old nephew. Belser would not confirm whether the child has been interviewed yet. And police would not release any other details about the shooting - as the investigation is ongoing. Belser says conducting interviews in this setting allows children to open up. Which helps those investigating. \"You're talking to them about something that is not normal. It's not a normal conversation. However, you're wanting it to feel as normal to them. {} So your challenge is getting them to talk to you about things they don't want to.\" {} Right now, the police will continue their investigation through other interviews. We will continue to follow this story as more information comes available."}
