(CBSNewYork) \u2014 An arrest has been made in connection to the murder of 13-year-old Shamoya McKenzie \u2014 a rising Westchester County basketball star who was killed by a stray bullet.\nFor more than two weeks, family and friends of McKenzie have prayed for justice. It appears their prayers have finally been answered.\nSources tell CBS2 a man in his 20\u2019s was taken into custody Monday morning by Mount Vernon police and federal law enforcement officers.\nAfter the shooting the suspect fled south, only to return to Mount Vernon at some point, according to sources.\nHe\u2019s facing second degree murder charges, according to sources.\nMayor Richard Thomas announced the news at a Martin Luther King Day event earlier Monday to a thunderous applause.\nThe teen basketball star was murdered in the middle of the day on New Year\u2019s Eve. She was shot in the head while sitting in her mother\u2019s car with a bullet meant for someone else.\nFuneral services for McKenzie were held late Friday afternoon.\nAmong the mourners at the Macedonia Baptist Church in Mount Vernon were some of Shamoya\u2019s teachers \u2014 still in shock over her sudden and senseless death.\n\u201cShamoya was just coming home from basketball practice doing what a 13-year-old should be doing with her mom, and it could have been any of our children,\u201d Christine Ceglio said.\nShamoya\u2019s death has so outraged local and state law enforcement that New York State Crime Stoppers announced that the reward for information leading to the killer\u2019s arrest had been doubled to $5,000.\nMcKenzie was laid to rest on Saturday at Mount Hope Cemetery in Greenburgh.\nA local basketball coach spoke with McKenzie\u2019s mother Monday night.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really hard on her, Saturday was brutally hard,\u201d Dawyne Murray of the Mount Vernon Junior Knights told CBS2\u2019s Tony Aiello. \u201cThis helps bring some kind of closure. But you don\u2019t want to feel happy about it \u2014 you caught a murderer. What you would like to do is have your daughter.\u201d\nThe Westchester County District Attorney\u2019s office will hold a briefing with the media Tuesday morning."}
