Brown, 18, of the 800 block of South 11th Street was being arrested by Richmond Police Department investigators on a charge of felony criminal recklessness, said Sgt. Mike Britt. He was booked into the jail at about 11:20 p.m. on a Level 6 felony charge carrying a bond of $15,000, with 10 percent cash.\nInvestigators were waiting to receive an update on the 16-year-old's condition, Britt said, to determine if a different charge is warranted.\n\"The charge could change dependent on the condition of the victim,\" he said.\nBrown told investigators he did not realize he was handling a real firearm, thinking it was a BB gun, Britt said, and he was surprised when it fired. The firearm has not been recovered.\nThe male victim was flown by LifeLine medical helicopter to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, after the incident, which took place at about 7:45 p.m.\nHe apparently was shot inside a home and was found in a yard across the alley that runs between South Seventh and South Eighth streets. Investigators were given consent to collect evidence inside the home.\nThe victim, apparently a guest at the residence, was transported to Richmond Municipal Airport to meet the medical helicopter.\nWitnesses to the shooting were taken to Richmond Police Department headquarters to be interviewed.\nThe intersection of South Seventh and South C streets was blocked by police and the 700 block of South C was blocked by crime tape until shortly after 10:30 p.m."}
