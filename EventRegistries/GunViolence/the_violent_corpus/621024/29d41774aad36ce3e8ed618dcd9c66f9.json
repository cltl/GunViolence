Paramedics rushed him to a nearby hospital, where he died.\nThe teenager who shot Gilliam fled the scene, police said. But several hours later, SWAT teams surrounded the suspect\u2019s home on the 2000 block of Bristol Lane and took the alleged gunman into custody. He is also 16 years old.\nAuthorities haven\u2019t said what motivated the killing, only that an argument broke out between the two and that they knew each other.\nThe suspect, who hasn\u2019t been named because he\u2019s a juvenile, is set to be arraigned Wednesday in Solano County Superior Court on murder and firearm charges, said District Attorney Krishna Abrams.\nOfficers are working to piece together the exact details of what led up to the shooting, including how the teenager got the gun, said Lt. Rob Lenke, a Fairfield police spokesman.\nKimberly Veklerov is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: kveklerov@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @kveklerov"}
