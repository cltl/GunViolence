Tony Turnbull, spokesman for Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department, said the shooting took place at a 7-Eleven near Marconi and Walnut avenues. No officers were injured.\nTurnbull said that around 1:50 p.m. the sheriff\u2019s department received a 911 call from a person who they believe to be the suspect. \u201cHe was being belligerent,\u201d Turnbull said, \u201ctalking about things going on in the nation\u201d as well as his hatred for police.\n\u201cThe suspect stated he wanted to talk to cops, but that they should dispatch a really big cop,\u201d Turnbull said in a statement released by the sheriff\u2019s department Thursday evening.\nOfficers received additional calls about a suspect behaving erratically at a 7-Eleven, Turnbull said.\nWhen they entered the store, officers saw the suspect run down an aisle. He told officers he had a gun, and then appeared \u201cwith a knife in his hand,\u201d Turnbull said.\nThe suspect, described as a white male in his late teens, began \u201cto stab himself in the neck,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cIt was clear to the officers that he hit an artery because of the way he was bleeding profusely.\u201d\nPolice fired \u201ca less lethal rubber bullet to incapacitate\u201d at the suspect, Turnbull said, but it was ineffective.\n\u201cThe suspect remained armed and became more agitated,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cAn officer, fearing for his safety and (the) safety of the other officers discharged his firearm once toward the suspect.\u201d\nIt is unclear if the bullet hit the suspect, Turnbull said.\nBleeding heavily, the suspect fell to the ground and was taken into custody, Turnbull said. Officers immediately attempted to provide aid to the suspect. He later was pronounced dead at the scene.\nThe official cause of death remains unknown pending an autopsy report from the Sacramento County Coroner\u2019s Office. The identity of the man will be released by the coroner after next of kin are notified.\nThe officer who fired his weapon is a 27 year veteran, Turnbull said.\nAuthorities said they found a knife and a handgun at the scene."}
