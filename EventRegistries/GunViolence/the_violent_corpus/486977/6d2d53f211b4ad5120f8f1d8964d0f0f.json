This chaos likely contributed to the fact prosecutors were unable to obtain a witness who saw Green shoot Oaks, Leyton said.\nThe prosecutor added that witnesses told varying accounts of the incident.\n\"I think the jury did a good job,\" Leyton said, adding that the case will remain under investigation.\nGreen's attorney, Glenn Cotton, could not be reached for comment on the verdict.\nGenesee Circuit Judge Judith Fullerton is scheduled to sentence Green on April 27. He faces up to life in prison."}
