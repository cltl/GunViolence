Joseph \"Moe\" Allen, 32, was taken into custody Saturday, after turning himself in, according to police.\nDetectives named Allen as a suspect on Friday. Police believe that he is one of several people involved in the Sunday shooting that left 17 injured at the park located in the 1900 block of Gallier Street.\nAuthorities are asking for anyone with additional information on the incident to contact NOPD Fifth District detectives at 504-658-6050 or Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111.\n\u201cThe news came on and my son\u2019s picture came on the screen. I hollered, \u2018what the hell?' I grabbed my cell phone and I called him,\u201d Deborah Allen said.\nAllen said she immediately got in touch with her son, Joseph \"Moe\" Allen, whom police say was one of the gunmen in the mass shooting at Bunny Friend Playground that left 17 people wounded. Deborah, though, said there\u2019s no way her son could have committed the shooting because he was in Texas at the time.\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to figure out how he can be in two places at one time,\u201d she said.\nAccording to the arrest warrant obtained by FOX 8, it was a lone witness who identified Joseph Allen as one of the shooters to detectives.\n\u201cThe neighborhood has a right to know who victimized their neighborhood,\" Deborah Allen said. \"My son is innocent. I\u2019m not a mother who is just trying to protect her son. My son did not do this.\u201d\nBut she also admits her son is no stranger to police. With an extensive criminal history, Joseph Allen entered the criminal justice system in 2002 and 2003, when he was arrested multiple times for drugs, including cocaine and heroin. He was also arrested for illegally carrying a weapon. For those charges, he received a five-year sentence.\nIn 2006, he was arrested for illegally carrying a weapon and distribution of cocaine. The charges were refused.\nIn 2007, Allen was picked up for three counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder. Those charges were also refused.\nIn 2008, he was arrested again for felon in possession of a firearm. The charges were dropped.\nIn 2010, he was arrested for a carjacking. The charges were reduced to possession of stolen things. Also in 2010, he was arrested for a home invasion, but was found not guilty.\nIn between arrests, a bill of information was filed for possession of cocaine and heroin. On those charges, Allen was sentenced in 2012 to eight years in prison as a habitual offender, which means he would not be afforded any good time, and would have to serve the entire sentence.\nIn 2013, though, that sentence was amended, which allowed him to be eligible for educational and/or work release programs.\nAllen\u2019s mother said her son was released in January of this year and moved to Texas, where he remains on parole. She said two weeks ago, when gunfire erupted at Bunny Friend Playground, Joseph Allen was shopping with his wife in Texas.\n\u201cMy daughter and them are out there right now. They are going to clear his name,\u201d Allen said.\nNow, she claims the family and his attorney are searching for surveillance video in Texas to prove their case.\n\u201cThey have the wrong guy. I feel for those people. I know what those people are going through, but I ask you, chief, to tell your men to get back out there and do their job,\u201d Allen said.\nAllen remains in jail on a $1.7 million bond.\nHis next court date is Dec. 8. That\u2019s when his mother says they\u2019ll have the evidence to prove her son\u2019s innocence.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE. All rights reserved."}
