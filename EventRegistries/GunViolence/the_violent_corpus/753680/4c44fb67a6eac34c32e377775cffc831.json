Trevino reportedly claimed a Hispanic man he argued with at the parking lot shot at him twice, leaving him with a gunshot wound to his left thigh, Sgt. Gary Duesler said Tuesday.\nBut a sheriff\u2019s official went back to the Jaguars Gold Club, reviewed several pieces of surveillance footage and found nothing that corroborated what Trevino told authorities. A spent bullet casing from a .38 Smith & Wesson gun was found in his clothes and Trevino reportedly told sheriff\u2019s authorities later that he didn\u2019t want to say anything further because he was under the influence, Duesler said.\nAt some point Trevino reportedly told authorities that he accidentally shot himself in the bathroom and that one of his cousins he attended the club with dialed 911, Duesler said. A sheriff\u2019s deputy Saturday said that a witness tried taking Trevino to the hospital but apparently got lost and ended up near an industrial site at Proctor Avenue and Cargo Road.\nTrevino was taken by ambulance to Medical Center Hospital for treatment of his injury and was released. Trevino, 124 Woods Brothers Road, was arrested on one warrant out of Hidalgo County that revoked his probation on a charge of driving while intoxicated. The second warrant was out of Cameron County on a burglary to a vehicle charge, Duesler said.\nTrevino was being held Tuesday at the Ector County Detention Center on no bond for either of the two warrants."}
