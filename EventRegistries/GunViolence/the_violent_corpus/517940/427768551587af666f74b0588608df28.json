Tony Turnbull said. \"That's why we continually send the message out for the people who have firearms in their home to lock them up.\"\nThe department's child abuse and homicide detectives were called to the scene. Investigators are still working to figure out how the toddler got a hold of the gun.\nNo other information was released."}
