Her parents told police that they heard the gunshot in the bedroom where the gun is stored, said San Diego police Lt. Jason Weeden. It was not immediately known how the gun was secured, if at all.\nThe family called 911, then panicked and rushed her to a nearby fire station for treatment. She was then taken to a hospital. The wound is not life-threatening, police said.\nNeighbors in the sprawling complex said they never heard the gunshot. After the family left for the fire station, they said they saw officers arrive at the apartment with guns drawn. Officers broke a window to the victim\u2019s second-floor apartment so they could get in.\nPolice Sgt. Phillip Worthington said that while the early investigation points to an accidental shooting, child abuse detectives will continue to look into the incident."}
