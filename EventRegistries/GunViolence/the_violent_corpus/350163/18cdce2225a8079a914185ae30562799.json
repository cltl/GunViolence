She was going to college and working at Marcs in Rocky River. She loved photography and animals. She was a shy artist who wanted to work with animals; she loved animals,\u201d Giovanis said. \u201cMy dad was in Vietnam. It was his job as a combat medic to save people's lives, so this doesn't make sense. I miss my dad's smile. I talked to him every day. He helped me in so many ways and he was very funny.\u201d\nJoshua Sulins lived across the hall from the gunman in an apartment building on Cleveland's west side.\nSulins said Wardzala had a temper, was jealous and controlling, but thought he wasn't capable of murder.\nSulins told newsnet5.com's Paul Kiska that Brittany was an \u201cinnocent, kind, a great soul.\u201d\nSulins said Wardzala hid using drugs from Brittany and got angry easily. He also said Cleveland Police searched Wardzala's apartment on Monday.\nKevin had cats in there and his nickname was Revan, after a character in a video game he played.\nSulins said both Reid and Wardzala worked for a discount grocery store chain and met through mutual friends.\nA GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family with funeral expenses.\nA memorial service will be held for Bob Clarke and Brittany Reid Saturday at the Faith Presbyterian Church in Lakewood across from the Lakewood Police Department at 2 p.m.\n---\nFollow @PaulKiska\nDownload the newsnet5 app:"}
