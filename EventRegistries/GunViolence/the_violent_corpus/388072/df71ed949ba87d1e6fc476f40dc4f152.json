His 6-year-old son was wounded when the boy's 9-year-old half-brother accidentally shot him.\nThe boy survived but was left with serious damage to his left arm.\nAt sentencing Tuesday, President Judge Kenneth G. Valasek asked McNeely's attorney, Timothy Kidd, whether McNeely was prepared to go to jail. Judges aren't bound to accept plea bargains.\n\u201cHe wasn't ready to go to jail, so I filed a motion to vacate the plea,\u201d Kidd said Wednesday.\nMcNeely is now scheduled to go to trial Sept. 12 on all original charges of reckless endangerment, two counts each of allowing a minor to have a firearm and endangering the welfare of children.\nDistrict Attorney Scott Andreassi said it's rare in the county for judges not to affirm plea bargains when presentence investigations recommend them.\n\u201cIt's a very odd situation given that Judge Valasek ... admitted the co-defendant into the ARD program,\u201d he said in a text.\nCourt records show that on July 7, McNeely's wife, Crista McNeely, accepted a form of probation for first-time offenders and was accepted into the accelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD) program for six months.\nValasek wasn't available for comment.\nChuck Biedka is a Tribune-Review staff writer."}
