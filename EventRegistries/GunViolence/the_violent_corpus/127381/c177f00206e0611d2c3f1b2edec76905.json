Neighbors walk and jog on a paved path beneath majestic oaks. Typically, the only noise that comes out of the nine-block city park happens once a week when city lawn mowers visit, keeping the grounds neatly clipped and trimmed.\nSunday, the serenity of an Easter afternoon was shattered by gunfire that left two dead and two wounded. Tampa police Monday continued their search for two men who shot into a crowd. One man was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, but police had not charged him in connection with the shooting.\nThe shots were fired at the park, 2902 N. 32nd St., just after 5 p.m. Sunday. Nearby, nearly 100 children were participating in an Easter egg hunt hosted by Monte Irvin, who coaches and mentors youth in East Tampa.\n\u201cIt was Easter; people were in their church clothes,\u2019\u2019 Irvin said Monday. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be happy, listening to gospel and the word of the church, and they just be killing. Why you got to come up here where all these kids are with a gun on you?\u201d\nIrvin had reserved the pavilion at the park for neighborhood children to have an Easter egg hunt.\n\u201cI had 3,000 eggs, so everyone could be taken care of,\u201d he said. He invited lots of people, including kids on a ball team he coaches, but as the day went on, more and more people showed up, he said. In all, maybe 85 children participated, with that many adults, he estimated.\nLater in the day, another group showed up and gathered near the softball field across the park from the pavilion, he said. That group had no children with them, he said.\n\u201cThey probably were just hanging around,\u201d said Irvin, who performs as local rapper Mowhawk Munchie. \u201cThey were far away from what we had going on. One dude kept running around; he was initiating some kind of problem over there. It just seemed like a fight broke out and I seen a guy pull out a gun and start shooting.\u201d\nHe was concerned about the children, but he ended up running to a man who had been shot in the head, wrapping his own shirt around the wound.\n\u201cI been crying all morning,\u201d he said Monday afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I been watching over my kids. Thank god my kids are OK. These are innocent people. It\u2019s just crazy.\u201d\nPolice made contact with Ronald Milliron III, 22, at the park on Sunday. Officers said that during a search, they found a pistol in his jacket pocket along with some marijuana. He was charged with 16 counts, including being a felon in possession of a firearm, tampering with evidence and carrying a concealed firearm.\nHe remained in the Hillsborough County jail. Bail was set at $96,250.\nPolice did not immediately charge him in the shooting and have not called him a suspect.\n\u201cThis is a very dynamic investigation,\u201d said police spokeswoman Janelle McGregor, \u201cand right now we are working to determine what his role was, if any, in the shooting.\u201d\nFlorida Department of Corrections records show Milliron served a year in prison for a 2012 burglary, grand theft and possession of marijuana and was released in August.\nThe wounded victims, identified as Danielle Allen, 21, and Ransom Flowers, 27, both of Tampa, were not cooperating with investigators, police said. Their conditions have stabilized, police said.\nTwo young men pronounced dead at the scene Sunday were Nico Charles Crawford, 22, and Zelmound Culpepper, 17, both of Tampa.\nThe shooting occurred after a small group of people began to argue, police said. The argument escalated into a physical fight and one person took out a gun and began firing it at a group, police said. A second person then took out a gun and also began to fire, police said.\nThey were not part of the Irvin\u2019s group, which had set up bounce houses for children.\nThe park, bordered by 21st Avenue to the north and 18th Avenue to the south, typically is quiet, neighbors say. It has a few basketball, tennis and racquetball courts and a softball field. A playground for children is in the northeast corner, along 29th Street.\nAlton Gaines lives nearby and jogs and walks nearly every day along the winding path that meanders beneath the huge oaks.\nThe park typically is a serene haven from drug activity and thug behavior, he said.\n\u201cThis is a nice neighborhood,\u201d he said as he took his daily walk Monday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s never any kinds of trouble.\u201d\nHe was in the park Sunday before the shooting and said there were children enjoying the playground and bounce houses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clean environment,\u201d he said, \u201cI can\u2019t say nothing bad ever happens here, but I\u2019ll still come here to do my jogging.\u201d\nAnne Gordon\u2019s house faces the park across 32nd Street. She\u2019s lived there for almost four decades and described the place as quiet, just like her neighborhood. It\u2019s been that way for as long as she could remember.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here 37 years and it\u2019s always been a safe park,\u201d she said. During the week, few people gather there, she said.\n\u201cOn the weekends, they have children\u2019s parties,\u201d Gordon said.\nHer observations were echoed by neighbor Attie Parker, who said other than the bustle on the weekends - usually people holding cookouts and birthday parties \u2013 the park is serene. She has lived in her home for 20 years.\n\u201cUsually,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s pretty peaceful.\u201d\nPolice reports confirm that. Over the past year, there are five pages of calls for service at or near the park, but most are for minor issues like parking violations and building checks, disturbances and park patrols. Occasionally, there are calls for drug activity and fights, but not often.\nOn Monday, detectives followed up on several leads, saying the community was cooperating to help identify the shooters.\nAccording to Hillsborough County jail records, Crawford has 13 arrests dating back to December 2009, but only one for a crime of violence. That was in May 2013 when he was arrested for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, a brick, and that charge was dismissed, records show. Most of the other charges were on trespassing, possession of marijuana and obstruction charges, records show.\nFlowers has a criminal record dating to 2002, including arrests on charges of aggravated stalking, possession of marijuana, robbery, grand theft and battery on a police officer.\nAnyone who has information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers immediately. Anonymous tips that lead to an arrest are eligible for up to $3,000 in cash.\nIrvin, who hosted the Easter egg hunt at the park Sunday, said the incident has rattled him. He said he had a few youthful years where he ran afoul of the law, but not for nearly a decade. Now, he\u2019s dedicated to raising \u2014 and protecting \u2014 his children and helping neighborhood kids rise above that bad behavior.\n\u201cI grew up in foster homes and I\u2019m trying to be a role model for a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cI coach baseball and football and try to give back to the community. I\u2019m trying to keep these kids from going down the wrong path.\u201d\nkmorelli@tampatrib.com\n(813) 259-7760"}
