Five men were shot, one fatally, and one woman caught in the crossfire narrowly missed being struck by a bullet that went through the driver\u2019s side window of her car.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say these are all linked together,\u201d said Lynn Police Lt. Rick Donnelly. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible some of them are linked. But at this time, we can\u2019t say that and at this time, it\u2019s all under investigation \u2026 It doesn\u2019t appear that anything\u2019s random. It appears that it\u2019s targeted individuals. I would say to the public be cautious. We don\u2019t think these are random incidents. We think these people have a plan and know what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s how it appears to us.\u201d\nDonnelly said the shootings occurred between Friday at 2:50 a.m. and Saturday just after 6:30 p.m.\nPolice responded to Melrose Wakefield Hospital just before 3 a.m. on Friday to find a 21-year-old man from Lynn with non-life-threatening injuries from two bullet wounds. The man told police he had been shot at Austin Square in Lynn near the 7-Eleven.\nLater that evening, at 8:13 p.m., police responded to a fatal shooting on Chestnut Street. Hanky Betancourt, 29, of Lynn, was taken to Union Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No arrests have been made, according to the Essex County District Attorney\u2019s office.\n29-year-old fatally shot on Chestnut Street\nAt 11:17 p.m. that same night, a call came in for shots fired on Hamilton Avenue. Donnelly said several shell casings were recovered and a house on the street was struck with gunfire.\nOn Saturday, shortly before 4:30 p.m., police responded to a report of gunshots on Neptune Boulevard. Donnelly said several shots were fired and two cars were hit. There were no victims.\nAbout an hour later, police made their way to Goodridge Street and spoke to 51-year-old Lynn native Lorraine Blowers DePietro. Donnelly said she was an innocent bystander at the wrong place at the wrong time, and is lucky to be alive.\nDePietro told The Item on Sunday that she was driving her brother-in-law\u2019s gold SUV by Goodridge Street shortly after 5:30 p.m., when a bullet went through her driver\u2019s side window and lodged itself in the leather seat she was sitting in, narrowly missing her body. She was left with a burning mark and a bruising welt from where the bullet whizzed by.\nDePietro said police told her the weekend shootings were retaliatory from Betancourt\u2019s fatal shooting, but Donnelly wouldn\u2019t confirm that statement.\nShortly after, police received a call from the Salem Hospital Emergency Room for a 26-year-old shooting victim. The man told police he was walking on Goodridge Street when he was shot. His injuries were non-life-threatening, Donnelly said.\nPolice then responded to a double shooting on Hanover Street shortly after 6:30 p.m. Authorities found two Lynn men, 17 and 19, who had both been shot in the lower legs. Both were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, but Donnelly said they weren\u2019t cooperating with police.\n\u201cIt appears to be some type of drug deal gone bad,\u201d he said.\nCity Councilor Brian LaPierre said the Human Rights Commission meeting scheduled for 6 p.m. tonight at City Hall, room 402, will shift its focus to helping people understand why the violence is happening and also put together some measures to ensure the safety of Lynn\u2019s citizens. He said he thought the meeting would provide an appropriate space for people to come to and hopefully feel some sense of comfort.\nLaPierre said the six shootings over the weekend are disturbing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on edge to say the least,\u201d LaPierre said. \u201cIt\u2019s frightening when it can happen so close by to where you live.\u201d\nIn response to the shootings, the Stop the Violence Lynn Committee called an emergency meeting on Sunday. Fred Hogan, a member, said the meeting was called by Antonio Anderson. Anderson is one of the new members of the subcommittee that Stop the Violence is putting together, made up of a group of men under 30 who have a better grasp of what\u2019s going on in the city at this time, Hogan said.\nHogan said the younger men have been working to make direct phone calls to people involved in the violence over the weekend, trying to keep heads calm and prevent further action. He said the incidents look like retaliatory gang shootings. Part of the work Stop the Violence does, he said, is trying to educate the younger kids, targeting them before they make the decision to get into gangs.\n\u201cThis situation that went on, it was just kind of out of control,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s over. Antonio, he\u2019s been making a lot of phone calls and trying to talk (people) down \u2026 Sadly, in the way we live now, you never know when something\u2019s going to go off. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so upset when something like this is going on in the city. This city can be so good. You have some things you have no control over.\u201d\nLynn Police Lt. James Shorten said on Sunday one arrest is part of the investigation, and may or may not be related. Matthew Sao, 24, of 121 High Rock St., was arrested Saturday night and charged with firearm-related offenses, drug possession with intent to distribute, violation of the city knife ordinance, receiving stolen property and failure to stop/yield.\nDonnelly said the arrest was made after a motor vehicle stop was conducted. Drugs and a gun were found in the car, he said, but declined to provide further details.\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s being investigated 24/7 by the detectives,\u201d Donnelly said of the shootings. \u201cThe police are on high alert.\u201d\nGayla Cawley can be reached at gcawley@itemlive.com.
