When she ran to the house, she saw two children: one shot just below the collarbone area, and another pleading for someone to help her.\nShe says her motherly instincts just kicked in when she heard the cries for help and called 911, preparing to take the child to a Mendenhall hospital.\nParamedics ended up airlifting the girl to UMMC because of the seriousness of her injuries.\nSheriff Bryan Bailey said the girl's 9-year-old brother shot her with a 22-caliber pistol.\nHe said the bullet remained lodged in the victim's spine.\n\"Our biggest concern, along with the family, is the welfare of the child, her getting better, and our prayers go out to her and her family,\" Bailey said. \"We are going to look into it and find out how the nine year old ended up with a weapon.\"\nA relative says the children are legally adopted by their grandfather.\nBailey said investigators are treating this as an accidental shooting at this point. It remains under investigation.\nA 15-year-old sister was home at the time of the incident.\nThe little girl is in stable condition at UMMC. We're told she is expected to make a full recovery.\nCopyright 2015 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved."}
