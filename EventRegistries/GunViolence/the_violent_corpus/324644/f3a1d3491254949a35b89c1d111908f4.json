The animosity between the two groups appears to have heated up after the March 19 fatal shooting of John Gerald Williams at Third Avenue and Pine Street, a notorious corner in Seattle\u2019s downtown core known as an open-air drug market.\nNo arrests have been made in either homicide investigation.\nA Kent police spokesman did not immediately return phone calls Wednesday, and a Seattle police spokesman said he couldn\u2019t provide a police report about the March shooting because the investigation is ongoing.\nAccording to the warrants filed by Kent detectives, Malijha Grant was strapped into a car seat when two men in a black car opened fire on the silver Chevrolet Impala her mother was driving about 4:30 p.m. April 16. Malijha\u2019s father, who is alleged in the warrants to be a Deuce 8 gang member, was in the front passenger seat.\nEarlier, Malijha\u2019s father had picked up her mother from the Renton restaurant where she works, then the parents picked up their daughter from a baby-sitter\u2019s house, the warrants say.\nThey stopped at a shopping complex at West Meeker Street and Washington Avenue South in Kent, about 1\u00bd miles from their apartment complex. Malijha\u2019s mother drove the family from the shopping center west toward their apartment complex, according to the warrants.\nAs Malijha\u2019s mother turned left onto Lake Fenwick Road from Reith Road, gunshots rang out, shattering the window behind the driver\u2019s seat, the warrants say. The adults ducked down and Malijha\u2019s mother accelerated, hitting a curb and sidewalk.\nA black car \u2014 described as looking like a Dodge Charger or Chrysler 300 \u2014 pulled alongside the Impala and more shots were fired into the vehicle, the search warrants say.\nMalijha was shot once in the head.\nTwo women driving behind the Impala stopped, and one of them performed CPR on Malijha while the second woman called 911, according to the warrants. Witnesses reported hearing four to eight gunshots, they say.\nMalijha died two days later.\nOne of the warrants obtained by Kent police gave detectives the authority to search the Impala, while the other two allowed them to search cellphones belonging to Malijha\u2019s parents.\nPolice want the couple\u2019s cellphone records to identify potential witnesses \u201cwho may have information leading to the identification of the shooter or motive for the shooting,\u201d the warrants say. The phone records can also help police track the parents\u2019 movements with the hope officers can locate \u201csurveillance cameras along the route to attempt to identify the black car described by witnesses as the shooter\u2019s car,\u201d they say.\nAccording to the warrants, a firefighter who responded to the shooting scene overheard Malijha\u2019s mother screaming at the baby\u2019s father, telling him, \u201cThis is all your fault!\u201d\nAnother witness, presumably one of the family\u2019s neighbors, told investigators \u201che had seen a black Charger-type car, not associated with the (apartment) complex, driving through the parking lot \u2026 on two occasions in the evenings prior to the shooting,\u201d according to one of the warrants.\nMalijha\u2019s mother told police the baby\u2019s father is a Deuce 8 gang member but that \u201che has not been very active in the gang after recently being released from custody,\u201d the warrants say.\nMalijha\u2019s father denied he was a member of Deuce 8 and told police \u201che had no idea why anyone would be shooting at their car,\u201d according to the warrants.\nA search of state and federal court records did not turn up any recent convictions for the father, who appears to have last been convicted in King County in 2011 on a firearms charge. In that case, the father and an associate were in a store in Seattle\u2019s Rainier Valley when the other man opened fire at someone outside, then was shot in the chest by a person returning fire, court records show.\nMalijha\u2019s father served jail time for the 2011 case. He was also released from a Washington prison in 2007 after serving time on a drug charge, according to court records and a spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections.\nPlay VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:00Loaded: 0%Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:00Playback Rate1\nChapters\nChapters\ndescriptions off, selected\nDescriptions\nsubtitles off, selected\nSubtitles\ncaptions settings, opens captions settings dialog\ncaptions off, selected\nCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreen\nThis is a modal window.\nCaptions Settings Dialog Beginning of dialog window.
