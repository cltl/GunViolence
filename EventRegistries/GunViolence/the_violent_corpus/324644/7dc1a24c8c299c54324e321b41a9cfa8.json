Thomas said Kime is a felon with a violent past who claims to be a member of a Seattle area street gang.\nIn addition to murder, he is being charged with two counts of first-degree assault since the child's parents were in the car at the time of the shooting.\nInvestigators say Kime has been in custody on unrelated federal charges of unlawful possession of a firearm.\nInvestigators have served dozens of search warrants in this case, sifted through hundreds of tips, and interviewed 213 witnesses.\nProsecutor Dan Satterberg said at least one other person is still responsible for Malijah Grant's death.\nMalijah died after being shot as she rode in a car with her parents. Another car had pulled up alongside them near the intersection of Lake Fenwick Road and Reith Road in Kent and two people inside opened fire. Grant was in the back seat of the car.\nInvestigators are asking if there are additional witnesses or people with information to call 911, or contact the Kent Police Department tip line at 253-856-5808.\nCrime Stoppers of Puget Sound is also offering a cash reward of $1,000 for information leading to the arrest and charges of the suspects involved.
