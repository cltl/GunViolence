(WKRN) \u2013 Three juveniles have been charged after one was shot in the neck as they played with a gun on Tuesday.\nThe Wilson County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to a home on Davis Corner Road shortly after 1 p.m. where they spoke with the three teenagers.\nAccording to a press release, the juveniles initially said someone pulled into the driveway of the home and fired at the victim before leaving.\nAuthorities say they later determined the teenagers were inside playing with the gun before the shooting happened, and other teenagers at the home attempted to hide it in the woods.\nDetectives reportedly searched the area thoroughly and recovered the gun.\n\u201cOnce we arrived at the residence, we got conflicting statements from witnesses,\u201d Sheriff Robert Bryan said. \u201cOnce we got everyone to cooperate and tell the truth, we determined the juveniles were playing with a gun and hit the victim in the upper part of his body.\u201d\nNews 2 spoke with the injured teenager after the shooting on Tuesday. He said he could\u2019ve easily died and can\u2019t stress enough that kids need to be safe with guns.\nAll three teenagers are set to appear in juvenile court on charges of filing a false police report.\nOne was also charged with possession of a handgun under the age of 18, tampering with evidence, and reckless endangerment.\n\u201cThe juveniles are very fortunate that this situation didn\u2019t rise to a level to where someone was killed,\u201d stated Bryan. \u201cThere is absolutely no room for playing around with a dangerous weapon.\u201d\nThousands of abortion opponents are gathering in the\u2026\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
