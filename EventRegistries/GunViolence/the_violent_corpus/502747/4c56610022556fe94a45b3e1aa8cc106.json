John Corina.\nDeputies responding to a report of gunfire arrived at the home to find the child's father holding the wounded girl, who was initially described by authorities as being 3 months old.\nSince the fire department had not arrived yet, the deputies rushed the girl to the hospital themselves, Corina said.\nThe deputies arrived at the hospital within two to three minutes and doctors worked on the girl for some time before she was finally pronounced dead, the lieutenant said.\nAccording to investigators, the shooting appeared to be gang-related.\n\"It looks like somebody drove up and were shooting into the house at somebody else and the baby caught a stray round,\" Corina said.\nDetectives only had a vague description of the suspects from witnesses who said the attackers were two black men in a four-door sedan.\nAnyone with information about this incident was asked to contact the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500.
