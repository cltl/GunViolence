She unloaded the weapon and apparently thought it was empty, but there was still one round in the chamber.\nShe accidentally fired the weapon striking her mother, 52-year-old Carolyn Wright, in the upper body. Wright was the teenager's grandma. She passed away in the home.\nOne of the teenagers panicked, picked up the gun and ran down the street where they threw it into a storm drain.\nDeputies have recovered the gun, digging into the storm drain to retrieve it.\nTwo big questions remain: Where did the teen get the gun? How long did he/she have it for? Deputies are digging for answers.\nThe mother who fired the gun isn't likely to face charges, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, who calls the shooting a tragic accident."}
