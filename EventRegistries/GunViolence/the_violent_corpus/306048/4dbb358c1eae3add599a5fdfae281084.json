Police initially considered taking the child to Kosair Children's Hospital in a squad car, later deciding to shut down more than 40 blocks of streets so an ambulance carrying the child could quickly get to the hospital.\nPrice's grandmother said the gun involved in the incident belonged to a teenager at the home.\n[OTHER NEWS: Man allegedly beat former foster father to death]\nWAVE 3 News received unconfirmed reports that another young child was responsible for the shooting. Dwight Mitchell, a police spokesman, would not confirm those reports, but said police were not looking for a shooter outside of the home.\n\"We're talking to witnesses at this point to get a better understanding of what happened,\" Mitchell told reporters Friday night.\nThere were other people inside the home when the shooting happened, Mitchell said.\nPolice closed one block of Algonquin Parkway during the investigation. They kept members of the media, including WAVE 3 News, close to a quarter-mile from the home, while other people were allowed to walk freely much closer to the scene.\nAfter WAVE 3 News reported this online, police allowed the media to move closer.\nThe Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms task force -- announced after a series of homicides recently -- was in the area when the shooting happened and responded to the scene along with Metro Police officers, Mitchell said.\nCopyright 2015 WAVE 3 News.
