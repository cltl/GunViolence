There were other people inside of the home. We're not sure of the number. Obviously we're talking to those individuals again,\" LMPD spokesman Dwight Mitchell said on scene Friday.\n\"There is nothing to indicate that we're looking for anybody other than what was in the house,\" Mitchell said.\nPolice closed Algonquin Parkway between Cane Run Road and South 34th Street for several hours.\nCopyright 2015 WDRB News.
