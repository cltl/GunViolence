And, when he went there to initiate the open house, he entered the residence and he heard a woman on the second floor calling for help,\u201d said Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo.\nThat's when all three were found in an upstairs bedroom. Police said the woman, identified as Erin Agren, killed her baby, Miles, and her husband, Michael Jordan, and then tried to kill herself. She may have been laying there for several days.\nhttp://twitter.com/JoannaKIRO7/status/623150289516802049\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising to find a 17-month-old that\u2019s been murdered. It\u2019s certainly shocking and certainly very difficult,\u201d said Elfo.\nElfo said Agren was badly injured and investigators are still trying to figure out a motive.\nOn Monday morning, KIRO 7 found a post on the Lummi Nation School's Facebook page saying that the man killed was a teacher there and there will be grief counselors on campus during summer school.\nThe education coordinator of Lummi Nation confirmed the names of the family and said Jordan began working with special needs students there in about 2007. Agren had been an intervention specialist at the school as well until two years ago when she left during her pregnancy to be a full-time mother.\nLIKE KIRO 7 Eyewitness News on Facebook"}
