A clerk there told abc27 a group of teenagers stole and/or destroyed $200-300 in merchandise.\nIt was part of a vandalism streak: Neighbors and police estimate more than 100 teens mobbed that section of Harrisburg around 10 p.m., after leaving Kipona.\n\u201cAll hell was breaking loose,\u201d said Betty Krause, a lifelong Midtown resident.\nThe group smashed up cars parked on the streets, slamming them with trash cans and bikes.\nThe dangling mirrors that remained on Sunday were mild compared to other reports of broken windshields and caved-in hoods and roofs.\nNeighbors say police dusted for fingerprints early Sunday morning; the black marks of the process were still evident on Carter\u2019s gold sedan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to track those kids down,\u201d Krause said, \u201cbecause they were from all over.\u201d\nA teenager was hit in the leg. Chief Carter said Sunday afternoon it appears the 15-year-old shot himself.\nHe\u2019ll be okay \u2014 the injury was not life-threatening \u2014 but police say he\u2019s not cooperating with their investigation.\nSo far, more than 10 people have filed damage reports with the department, with dozens more cars affected.\nBut even though police have made no arrests, McAlicher will keep doing what she\u2019s doing."}
