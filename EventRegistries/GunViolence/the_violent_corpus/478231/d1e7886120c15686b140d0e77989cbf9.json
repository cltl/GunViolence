A 2-year-old boy was airlifted to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. There is no word on his condition.\n\"Not sure of the current condition right now,\" said Lt. Scott Baxter with Dubuque Police. \"It was a very serious injury, hence the transportation to University of Iowa.\"\nPolice believe the shooting may have been an accident but are still investigating what led up to the gun going off and whether someone shot the child or if the child had the gun when it went off.\nNo one has been arrested but police say charges are still possible in the case.\n\"There were several people inside the residence when it did happen,\" said Lt. Baxter. \"Obviously interviews have to be conducted, the scene has to be processed, all of that is still on going.\""}
