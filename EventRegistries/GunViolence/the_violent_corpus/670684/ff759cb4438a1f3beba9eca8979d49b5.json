He was shaking, didn't know what to do. None of the kids knew what to do, hurt, they\u2019re hurt, they\u2019re used to playing out here, they\u2019re probably not going to want to play out here no more,\u201d the witness said.\nNeighbors said children are often playing in the area where police spent time Wednesday evening collecting multiple shell casings.\n\u201cRiding their bikes, riding their little scooters and just playing, that's all, just playing. An everyday thing for them. They're either on the basketball goal, riding their bike, running up and down,\u201d the witness said. \u201cAnd that's what they get today - nonsense.\u201d\nNow neighbors are worried about the boy who took a bullet and the other children whose lives are now marred by violence.\n\u201cThey don't even think of what they're doing to the neighborhood. I'm pretty sure they know we got to live around here, they probably come from somewhere else and they're not even thinking about our kids,\u201d the witness said.\nThe investigation into the incident in ongoing. If you have any information that could help police with this case call Crimestoppers at (504) 822-1111.\nCopyright 2016 WVUE. All rights reserved."}
