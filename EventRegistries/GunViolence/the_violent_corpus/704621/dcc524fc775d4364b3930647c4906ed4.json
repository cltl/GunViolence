State Fairgrounds Saturday.\nIt happened around 10:15 a.m. at the Jim Graham Building at 1025 Blue Ridge Road.\nWake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison said William Daniel Glosson, 30, Alyssa Lewis Glosson, 29, and Lasonya Judd were leaving the gun show. William Glosson wanted to buy a matching gun as a gift for his wife.\nWilliam Glosson had bought two weapons, one of which was similar to a gun he already owned. Once they were in the vehicle to leave the fairgrounds, William handed his personal weapon and one of the handguns he had purchased to Judd, who was sitting in the backseat, to compare the two weapons.\nHarrison said Judd accidentally caused the loaded weapon to discharge. The projectile struck the seat and then struck Alyssa Glosson in the back of the head.\n\"He says, 'Look at this,\" and some how or another when she grabbed it -- the gun went off,\" said Harrison.\nWilliam called 911 and told authorities the gun went off and grazed his wife's head.\nInvestigators said they believe the seat rest stopped some of the bullet's impact.\nAuthorities said she was responsive and was rushed to WakeMed. She was discharged later in the afternoon and told ABC11 she is fine.\nNo charges are pending at this time as it is being considered an accident.\nAll three live in Cameron, N.C.\nThis is the second time in four years that someone has been shot at a gun show in Raleigh.\nReport a Typo"}
