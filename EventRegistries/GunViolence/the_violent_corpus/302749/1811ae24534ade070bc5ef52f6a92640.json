Now, the 17-year-old hunter who pulled the trigger faces four felonies, including reckless homicide, homicide by negligent handling of a gun, and endangering safety.\nInvestigators said Ryan Korish and his father, both from La Crosse, first said Korish was shooting away from McFarlane's location. They later admitted they lied because Korish had been shooting illegally from a road.\nKorish's father has been charged with obstructing an officer. Investigators said the roof-line of McFarlane's home was visible from Korish's location."}
