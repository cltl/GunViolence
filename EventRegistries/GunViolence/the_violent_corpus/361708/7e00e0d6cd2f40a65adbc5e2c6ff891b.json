He died Thursday night at UK Hospital.\nShahied Rashid met El-Amin in 1975 at Douglass Park during a Muslim gathering. El-Amin was just three years old at the time.\n\"I still see that evolving three-year-old,\" Rashid told LEX 18's Josh Breslow. \"He was the kind of child that any father would be proud to say, 'this is my son'.\"\nAs Lexington's Muslim community grew, Rashid became the Imam, or prayer leader, of the Masjid Bilal mosque where El-Amin's father was a founding member.\n\"We knew that in his nature and his personality, he was always Kwame who was an upright person, really. An upright Muslim in his nature,\" Rashid said.\nEl-Amin was shot Sunday night at the same park where he met Rashid 40 years earlier, as El-Amin watched the Dirt Bowl, a basketball event.\n\"When I talk to his friends, you know, they remember him as a person who sold fish off his truck, you know? Sold incense. He always wanted to improve the plight of his people,\" Rashid said.\nEl-Amin's family created a GoFundMe page to help raise money to bury the man they describe as a loving father and a hard-working owner.\n\"I want to say I loved him. I want to say I love his family. And I want to say I love the people that love him. And I hope that we can work together for a better life for all of us,\" Rashid said.\nA celebration of life will be held Sunday. No specific details have been released.\nThe other victims of the shooting are expected to survive. No arrests have been made in the case,\nAnyone with information is asked to contact the Lexington Police Department at (859) 258-3600 or Bluegrass Crime Stoppers at (859) 253-2020."}
