Hill said in a statement that Jeremiah Ross, 3, died of an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound suffered when a 9 mm handgun left in the master bedroom of his home discharged. The boy was in the bedroom with his mother, who left the room momentarily. She reported hearing a popping sound and returned to the bedroom and found that the child had been wounded. Hill said that, based on evidence gathered by the Elkhart police department, the weapon accidentally discharged while the boy was handling it.\nThe gun was legally owned by the boy's father, who was not at home at the time of the accident. Hill reminded gun owners to make sure that weapons are properly secured so that they cannot be accessed by children."}
