One female is in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the face.\nEight of the victims have been released from the hospital, Bridgeport Police Chief \u201cAJ\u201d Perez confirmed at a press briefing Sunday. Four remain under observation and one remains critical. Most of the victims are between 18 and 24. None of them have been publicly identified at this time.\nAccording to police, and party-throwers attempted to apply for a permit for the event but it was denied.\n\u201cIt was denied because they wanted to sell alcohol and charge for the party. So we frown upon that and did not allow this party to go on,\u201d Perez said.\nInvestigators believe the party appears to have been for profit and there may be charges against the people who threw it.\nThe party went on without a permit, and the 13 victims were injured when at least two shooters fired through the hedges from the backyard at 31/33 Plymouth St. and struck the victims at 19 Plymouth St. Police said it was a confusing scene and witnesses said at first they didn\u2019t realize what was happening.\n\u201cWe had what we believe in excess of 100 party goers,\u201d said Bridgeport police Capt. Brian Fitzgerald. \u201cSo people initially thought was fireworks. By some accounts even the DJ said don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s fireworks until people started realizing they were shot.\u201d\nPolice recovered 10 shell casings from a large-size caliber handgun, and it\u2019s possible other weapons without casings were also used. Right now police are still looking for a motive.\nPerez said the department has stepped up patrols in the area while detectives investigate.\n\u201cI am very confident and I say this with full confidence because I believe in the Bridgeport police department, the men and women that work here, we\u2019re going to have an arrest in this matter in the very near future,\u201d Perez said.\nAnyone with information should contact the police at (203) 576-8477.\nBridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim and US Senator Richard Blumenthal, who both also attended the media briefing, praised police efforts. Blumenthal said he had a meeting with ATF earlier Sunday afternoon and promised federal assistance in the case if needed."}
