Perez said the party hosts, who were not identified, applied for a city permit to sell alcohol prior to the party but were turned down because such sales violate city ordinances. He said the hosts, who rent one of two duplexes at 19 Plymouth Street, went ahead with the party anyway.\n\u201cWe had a tough morning,\u201d Perez said during a Sunday afternoon press conference. \u201cOfficers encountered a chaotic scene with people suffering from gunshot wounds.\u201d\nAt about 1:30 a.m. Sunday morning, two shooters, hiding behind six foot hedges at a next door property at 31-33 Plymouth Street, opened fire on the party goers with multiple weapons, including high powered handguns, police said. No suspects have been apprehended and a motive was not yet known, police said.\nEleven victims sustained non-life threatening wounds to their lower extremities and one male sustained a gunshot to the face that is not life threatening One female is in critical condition at Yale New Haven Hospital with a gunshot to the face. She is expected to survive but will require reconstructive surgery.\nMany of the victims were taken to a hospital by private car while others were transported by ambulance, making the situation even more confusing for officers, police said.\nMayor Joseph Ganim called the incident a \u201chorrendous act that impacted so many people and, God willing, we will not have a fatality.\u201d\nU.S. Sen Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, said police will find the \u201canimal who committed this atrocious act of criminality,\u201d and called for Congress to enact \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun laws to take weapons off the streets of city\u2019s like Bridgeport.\nCitizens with information about this crime should call 203-576-TIPS (8477)."}
