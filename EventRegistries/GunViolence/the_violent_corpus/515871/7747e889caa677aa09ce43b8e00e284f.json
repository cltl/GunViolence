Logan's dad, Daryl Neal, told us Friday night that \"...it is beyond belief how well he is.\"\nThe father showed us pictures that show little scarring on Logan's face. He said the bullet missed Logan's artery by one millimeter, and the largest part of the bullet fragment is in his top vertebra, 5 millimeters from his spinal cord.\n\"It's been two weeks since Logan's accident. He is a miracle,\" Daryl said. \"Thank you for your prayers for my son and my family.\""}
