He was talking, I'd ask him to spit and he would spit blood out.\"\nBisher says he continued to put pressure on the wound near the bridge of his nose before the ambulance showed up.\nKentucky State Police say the shooting was most likely an accident.\n\"At this time, it's an accidental investigation,\" says trooper Michael Robichaud. \"The investigation will continue and, if anything further comes for it, then we will pursue that.\"\nBisher says no matter how safe you are with your firearm, accidents can still happen.\n\"It was just a terrible accident,\" says Bisher.\nBisher says the toddler is at a hospital in Louisville. He says doctors there are trying to determine the proper procedure for removing the bullet."}
