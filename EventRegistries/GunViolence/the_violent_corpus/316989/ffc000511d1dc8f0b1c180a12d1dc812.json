(AP) \u2014 Police say a man apparently fatally shot his wife and two young sons before killing himself at their family home in Tulsa.\nSgt. Dave Walker said in a news release that a 42-year-old man, his 38-year-old wife and their 6- and 10-year-old sons were found shot to death Wednesday. Their names have not yet been released.\n\u201cThe evidence indicates that the father shot and killed the children and the wife before turning the gun on himself,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThere is evidence of multiple gunshots throughout the house. All the bodies were found in different rooms throughout the house.\u201d\nThere was no indication of forced entry and no suspects are being sought, Walker said.\nPolice Capt. Matt McCord said officers found a handgun near the man\u2019s body. The woman\u2019s employer requested a welfare check after she failed to show up for work or call in sick for two days.\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the events and called the area safe.\nMost every property in the neighborhood has a large fence, so children can play or swim in privacy, though some play hoops in the driveway or at a cul-de-sac.\n\u201cI love this neighborhood. It\u2019s very quiet here,\u201d Mercedes Perez told The Associated Press.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
