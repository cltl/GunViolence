The boy's stepfather was not home. Dolunt said he had \"stepped out the house for a minute\" and came back and discovered the boy.\n\"We don't know if he was playing with the gun or if another child in the basement was,\" Dolunt said, adding that the boy was shot once in the face with a shotgun.\nDolunt said all of the children and teens will be questioned but they're traumatized by the shooting. Dolunt said the two officers who responded to the scene are shaken up.\n\"It's traumatic,\" he said. \"Everyone around here is having a tough time. It's a bad scene when a kid gets shot. All I can say is if you have guns in the house, please, please keep them out of kids' reach. Don't have them loaded. Get a gun lock.\"\nJasmine Anderson, 47, said she lives on Roxbury Street but doesn't know the family since they recently moved on the street, but said it's sad for a child's life to be cut short.\n\"It's unbelievable when things like this happen,\" Anderson said, while pointing at the police tape that blocked off the street. \"We're all going to pray for those babies who had to see something like that. I can't imagine the pain the family must be feeling.\""}
