Kim, Chicago Tribune)\nOn Sunday, Carlos Watson went fishing with his 11-year-old grandson Antwone Price in Washington Park on the South Side.\nThe fish weren't really biting and they caught mostly weeds as the boy learned to cast a fishing rod, Watson said.\nThree days later, Watson sat on a yellow curb outside Comer Children\u2019s Hospital, his hands clasped on the back of his head. Inside, his grandson lay dead after being accidentally shot in the abdomen around 9 p.m. Wednesday in his Park Manor home on the South Side, according to police.\n\u201cThis was a kid beyond his years,\" Watson said.\nPolice say Antwone was shot as an 18-year-old relative played with a semi-automatic handgun the boy's friend claimed to have found. Antwone's friend was visiting at the home in the 7400 block of South St. Lawrence Avenue and showed the .38-caliber gun to the 18-year-old, police said.\nNo charges had been filed against the 18-year-old Thursday afternoon.\nRelatives who gathered at the hospital said Antwone lost his father to gun violence two years ago.\nAntwone Earl Price Sr., 30, and another man were found dead in Price's parked white Camaro in the 7100 block of South Oakley Avenue in Englewood on May 22, 2013. Relatives said the killing has not been solved. In Tribune reports at the time, Price's grandmother, Myrtis Price, said her son, Anthony Price, who was the older Antwone Price's father, was shot and killed in 2000.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so unreal,\u201d Antwone\u2019s grandmother Barbara Sanders said outside the hospital. \u201cWe\u2019re just in shock. It\u2019s like ... why are we here again?\u201d\nSanders, Watson and his wife Michele Watson were joined by more than two dozen family members and friends outside the hospital. Some wept loudly, some paced and smoked cigarettes. A few hugged brown teddy bears.\nMichele Watson's eyes were wide and her face was red from tears, but she smiled as she talked about Antwone. \u201cHe was just a good kid,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loved life.\u201d\nThe boy was a deacon at his church, according to the Watsons, who said Antwone's dream and passion was to become a funeral director. He had helped make arrangements for his aunt's funeral last year, relatives said.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t your average 11-year-old,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe was like a 30-year-old in an 11-year-old body.\u201d\nHis grandparents said Antwone himself organized his recent transfer to Comer College Prep Middle School, where he started sixth grade about a week ago.\n\u201cHe said the previous school wasn\u2019t challenging enough for him,\u201d said Michele Watson, chuckling at the memory.\nShe said one of her fondest moments was this year\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day. Watson said Antwone brought fresh flowers and chocolate-covered strawberries for Watson, his mother and his aunt."}
