Grove, arrest records show.\n\u201cHe was taken into custody without incident,\u201d homicide Lt. Todd Ojile said.\nBryant was booked into the Sedgwick County Jail on suspicion of two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of aggravated battery and one count of criminal possession of a firearm.\nA Crime Stoppers tip received via text message led to Bryant\u2019s arrest, said Gordon Bassham, executive director of the Wichita Crime Commission. Crime Stoppers is a division of the crime commission.\nBryant is accused of killing Andrew Smith, 28, and Quentin Brown, 32, in the parking lot of the Place bar and grill at 4859 E. Harry shortly after 1:30 a.m. on Saturday.\nBrown and a 36-year-old man got into an argument with Bryant inside the club, police have said, and the dispute continued outside. Bryant is accused of pulling out a gun and shooting Brown and the 36-year-old man.\nIt\u2019s still not clear what prompted the argument, Ojile said. All three men involved in the argument are documented gang members, he said, with Bryant in a different gang than the other two.\nSmith, who was a bystander, was struck by three shots as he was leaving the bar, Ojile said. He was pronounced dead at 2:26 a.m. on Saturday at Wesley Medical Center. Brown was shot once in the chest and died at Wesley at 5:44 a.m.\nA 25-year-old bystander was hit in the leg by a stray bullet and was treated at Via Christi Hospital St. Francis before being released, police have said. The 36-year-old man was shot in the abdomen and was released Monday from a local hospital, Ojile said.\nPolice have said only one person fired shots, but they are still hoping to talk to more people.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking for any witnesses,\u201d Ojile said. \u201cWe know there\u2019s people out there we want to talk to.\u201d\nInvestigators have not recovered the gun used in the shooting incident.\nBassham said the tip gave police Bryant\u2019s name and an address where he could be found. Officers arrested Bryant two hours after the the tip came in.\nOfficers were sent to a few potential addresses where Bryant could be found, Ojile said.\nBryant has a prior criminal history that includes pleading guilty to drug possession and criminal threat, Sedgwick County District Court records show.\nEvidence in the fatal shootings case will be presented Thursday morning to the Sedgwick County District Attorney\u2019s Office, said Dan Dillon, a spokesman for the district attorney\u2019s office.\nReach Stan Finger at 316-268-6437 or sfinger@wichitaeagle.com.
