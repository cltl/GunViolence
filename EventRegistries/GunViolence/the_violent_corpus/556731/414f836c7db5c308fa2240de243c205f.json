He was a student at C.E. Byrd High school and described as loveable, quiet and adventurous.\nThe family held a candle light vigil to remember Josh. They are still in shock.\n\"It's been so surreal. It's just unbelievable. It doesn't seem like he's gone,\" said Clark's cousin. Barbara James.\nShreveport Police say Josh was shot inside a car parked on the shoulder of Barrett Street at the intersection of Wilkinson Street. They say it's believed that 18-year-old DaMarcia Clark was mishandling a handgun and it fired.\nThe two teenagers were uncle and nephew.\n\"Somehow it went off. It's just accident. It just hit his uncle and right now we're just praying for both of them because even though he's gone they was close. They was thick as thieves,\" said James.\nFamily friend, Coreen Wilson says Josh had a great relationship with his mother and she's taking it hard.\n\"She still doesn't believe that it's true.

She's just in a total, total shock,\" said Wilson.\nFamily and friends are now celebrating Josh's life as they push through this difficult time.\n\"Pray for the family in a time of need because they really need it and they just didn't lose one person. They lost two today,\" said Wilson.\nThe family set up an account to help with Josh's burial expenses.\nYou can donate at Shreveport Federal Credit Union under the account name: Mary Clark for benefit of Joshua Clark, account number 35836107."}
