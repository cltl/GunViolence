Three people \u2013 Samantha Parreira, 16; Bernabed Hernandez-Canela, 18; and Matthew Fisher, 19 \u2013 were fatally shot and two other young people were injured. \u201cThree young people were killed that night, and hopefully this will bring a little bit of closure, but we will never forget, ever forget,\u201d said Desiree Parreira, Samantha\u2019s mother.\nFamilies of the other victims could not be reached Thursday for comment.\nJose L. Botello and Jose M. Carballido, both 19-year-old Atwater residents, and Jacob Tellez, 18, of Merced, were arrested by detectives with the sheriff\u2019s Major Crimes Unit this week on suspicion of murder and gang participation, Detective-Sgt. Chuck Hale said at a Thursday news conference.\nAll three suspects remained behind bars Thursday without bail.\nTellez was arrested early Thursday in San Jose. He was still going through the booking process Thursday afternoon and a mugshot was not immediately available. Botello and Carballido were arrested late Wednesday in Atwater. Both Atwater residents belong to the same criminal street gang, and Tellez is a member of another gang, Hale said.\nDetectives have not ruled out the possibility of making additional arrests. Deputies said the party started as a holiday gathering for high school students that escalated when word of the gathering spread through social media and text messages, attracting more than 100 people, including members of several Merced County street gangs.\nHale declined to comment on the specific incidents at the party that sparked the gun violence, saying releasing certain details, including the number of shooters or whether any murder weapons have been recovered, could harm the investigation. Cooperation from the public and witnesses was a critical factor in making the arrests, Hale said, although he stressed the need for additional help. \u201cThere are other people out there that have more information about this party and we invite them to come forward,\u201d Hale said.\nDesiree Parreira pleaded for anyone with knowledge of the incident to reach out to sheriff\u2019s investigators. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cIf we keep running around being scared, these gangs are just going to take over and they\u2019re going to take everybody away from us.\u201d\nShe described her daughter as a \u201ccharismatic, go-getting\u201d young lady who was close to her siblings. The family on Monday celebrated what would have been Samantha\u2019s 18th birthday. She would have graduated from high school earlier this year. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to share those things with her anymore. I don\u2019t get to have that anymore and it\u2019s not fair,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen she was taken from me, it just hardened my heart to know there\u2019s people out there who\u2019d take her away from us.\u201d\nParreira\u2019s aunt, Charlotte Alves, said she was \u201coverjoyed\u201d with news of the arrests. \u201cMy Sammie was such a good girl. Her smile could light up any room,\u201d Alves said. \u201cShe had so much life, so many dreams that will never be accomplished now. This means so much.\u201d\nSheriff Tom Cavallero praised the work of the detectives and deputies \u201cwho collaborated so well in this effort and were absolutely driven to bring about a resolution.\u201d\nDesiree Parreira said the arrests sparked a range of emotions and hadn\u2019t really \u201csunk in\u201d yet. She said all the families want justice for their loved ones. \u201cMy daughter was 16 years old, and I\u2019m never going to see her again because of these people,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to forgive, but I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d"}
