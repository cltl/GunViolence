The gun was placed on the floor, where the boy later found it.\nOn the gofundme website, it states the gun was placed on the floor by non-family members helping with the move before the youngster found it, picked it up and pulled the trigger.\nTwo bones in Sorensen\u2019s foot were fractured and his pinky toe was shattered. He will need surgery to fix the shattered toe, according to family members. The doctors will be using bone from his hip to replace the bone in his foot.\nDonations will help with the medical costs and the monthly expenses for Sorensen\u2019s family until he recovers.\n\u201cOur family has been so grateful and humbled by this experience,\u201d the family posted on the gofundme site. \u201cWords can\u2019t even describe the love, help, and concern that has already been given by so many. We are very thankful for any help in this time of need.\u201d\nAccording to statistics published in the Washington Post, shootings involving toddlers were relatively frequent in the U.S. last year. In 2015 there were at least 13 toddlers (ages 3 or younger) who accidentally killed themselves with a firearm, 18 who injured themselves, 10 who injured other people; and two who killed someone else."}
