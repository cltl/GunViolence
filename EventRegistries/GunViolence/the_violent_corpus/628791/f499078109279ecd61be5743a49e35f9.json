Two victims, an 8- and 9-year-old boy, died from their injuries.

And they have easy access to the instruments of destruction.\"\nRosilyn Temple, an integral part of Mothers in Charge anti-violence advocacy group, knows the family.\n\"I want my community to speak out,\" Temple said. \"We got to step up and get them off of our streets. This is a monster.\"\nAntonio Reese and others on the block woke up to police cars and first responders.\n\"Come to find out, it was kids my little cousin played with,\" Reese said.\nA different man, who did not want to be identified on camera, said another child in the house ran to his home and asked him to dial 911.\nSince October 2014, at least 15 children under the age of 16 have been murdered in the Kansas City metro area.\n\"It's sad man,\" Reese said. \"Stuff's getting old. These kids deserve to see another day.\"\nPolice say that they do not have any suspect information at this time.
