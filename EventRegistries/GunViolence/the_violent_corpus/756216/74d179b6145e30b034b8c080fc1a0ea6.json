Hancel Woods told the Times-Union.\nThe five-hour-long standoff began about 1:50 p.m. when the suicidal man, armed with a handgun and shotgun, retreated into some woods in the Bardin area and then scaled a tree, Woods said.\nWoods said the man fired about 12 rounds indiscriminately from his perch in the tree stand, but did not appear to be firing toward the deputies gathering below.\nHe said the man shot himself in the right shoulder after crisis negotiators coaxed him down, but the man was conscious and alert as paramedics transported him to the hospital.\nWoods praised the \u201cremarkable restraint\u201d of the deputies involved, adding that they did a \u201cfantastic job.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot better than it could have gone.\u201d\nGarrett Pelican: (904) 359-4385"}
