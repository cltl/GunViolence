The officers located one victim who suffered gunshot wounds. He was taken to a hospital and was in stable condition Saturday.\nThree additional victims arrived at a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\u201cIt appears a few people were shooting at the time,\u201d said Sacramento Police Department spokeswoman Michele Gigante.\nShe described a chaotic, crowded scene before the shooting. A person was being chased by police after \u201cjumping on one of our patrol cars,\u201d she said, when the shots were fired.\nShe said one gun and several rounds were found in the area.\nThe R Street corridor has been a story of transformation for downtown Sacramento. The once-rundown industrial district has blossomed in recent years into a popular enclave of restaurants, clubs and retail venues that attracts visitors throughout the day and well into the night.\nOn Saturday afternoon, under blue skies and a bright winter sun, restaurant patrons relaxed at outdoor patio tables with pitchers of mimosas, beer and sweaty glasses of white wine. The black doors to the Ace of Spades remained shut, but a marquee announced that the night\u2019s attraction \u2013 Bone Thugs-N-Harmony \u2013 was sold out. Next weekend will feature Black Veil Brides and Dem Bay Boyz, the marquee read.\nMost R Street pedestrians interviewed Saturday by The Sacramento Bee had heard about the shootings the night before, but few expressed grave worries about their own well-being or the safety of the rehabilitated commercial district.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t worry me,\u201d said Marcus Richards, 40, an attorney who lives in midtown. \u201cI think these things are pretty targeted. Now, if random people like me start getting shot ...\u201d\nSeveral said they believed alcohol likely fueled the situation. \u201cDrinking makes people aggressive, and they want to fight,\u201d said Mike, who would not give his last name but described himself as a 58-year-old Sacramento native. \u201cTheir whole behavior changes.\u201d\nSkyler Henry and Hollis Lawrence, who paused in front of the club to study the upcoming acts, said they have enjoyed the music venue and are unconcerned about Friday\u2019s outburst of violence.\n\u201cYou could go anywhere and something bad could happen,\u201d said Henry, 31, who waits tables.\nPhil Logsdon, 43, who works as a barber near the club, isn\u2019t worried about any fallout for the salon, which closes at 6 p.m. on Saturdays. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect my business at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s downtown,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Sacramento.\u201d\nCall The Bee\u2019s Denny Walsh, (916) 321-1189.\nThe Bee\u2019s Brian Nguyen contributed to this story"}
