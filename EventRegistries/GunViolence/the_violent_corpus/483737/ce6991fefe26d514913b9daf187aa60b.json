I guess it happened toward the front.\"\nRepresentatives of 'Lil Mouse and Nino could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\u2018Lil Mouse recently faced criticism for a music video he produced last year when he was 13 years old that featured strong language and showed people waving guns in the camera.\nFighting among gangs has claimed a mounting toll of lives in some predominantly African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods of Chicago over the last year. Chicago surpassed 500 homicides last year for the first time since 2008.\nA high school girl who performed at President Barack Obama's inauguration, Hadiya Pendleton, was gunned down earlier this year at a park about a mile away from the Obama's Chicago home. Her death focused national attention on Chicago's murder rate, and First Lady Michelle Obama attended her funeral.\n(Editing by Scott Malone and Andrew Hay)"}
