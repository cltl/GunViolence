The other victim suffered a wound that wasn\u2019t life threatening.\nTwo people were taken into custody after the hospital shooting, said Lt. Joey Crosby with the Myrtle Beach Police Department. The suspects will be identified when they are formally charged, but Crosby said that may not happen until Sunday.\nThe child was shot around 1 p.m. at a home on Carnation Circle, said Horry County Police Lt. Raul Denis. Investigators believe the child found a gun in a dresser drawer and accidentally fired the weapon. Denis said police do not expect to charge anyone in the child\u2019s case.\nThe second shooting happened a few hours later outside the rear entrance of Grand Strand Medical Center. Late Saturday, police were still piecing together how the situation unfolded, but they said family members began arguing and one person was shot. The victim wasn\u2019t identified.\nLoretta Dellinger of Calabash, N.C., was visiting her stepfather after his brain surgery when she heard the commotion outside.\n\u201cI just kept hearing people screaming and gunshots,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh my God! What\u2019s going on?\u201d\nDellinger looked outside the hospital room window and saw men fighting and women screaming.\n\u201cI was scared to death,\u201d she said.\nThe hospital was briefly placed on lockdown after the shooting, said Grand Strand spokeswoman Julie Kopnicky.\n\u201cWe are cooperating fully with their investigation and continuing to provide support and care to our patients and families,\u201d she said via email. \u201cOur top priority is providing the highest level of care for our community in a safe and caring environment.\u201d\nPolice were still on scene at 6:30 p.m., but the crime scene tape had been removed and visitors were using the back entrance again.\nContact CHARLES D.
