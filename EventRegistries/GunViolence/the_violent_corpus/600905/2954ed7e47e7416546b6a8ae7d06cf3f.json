When the teens were about a block away from the playground, a gunman stepped out of an alley near Edgewood Avenue and opened fire, according to police.\nThe 15-year-old was shot in the face, a 14-year-old was shot in the arm and a 16-year-old in the leg. All three teens were taken to Penn Presbyterian Hospital where doctors pronounced the 15-year-old dead shortly after midnight. Doctors listed the other two teens in stable.\nInvestigators said the 15-year-old boy who was shot in the face may have been involved in some type of altercation last week during a community basketball league game that was broken up by organizers. They have not yet confirmed whether or not the shooting was related to that.\nPolice have not yet released information on any suspects. They continued to investigate early Tuesday."}
