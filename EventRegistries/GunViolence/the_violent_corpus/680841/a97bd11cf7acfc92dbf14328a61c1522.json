(LEX 18) -- An arrest was made Thursday evening in an attempted robbery in Lexington that resulted in two men being shot.\nThe incident happened on Red Mile Road back in October and resulted in a lengthy standoff at an apartment complex. Police say the alleged motive behind that violent attack was marijuana. Investigators tell LEX 18 that the apartment was targeted after the suspects heard that the person living there was dealing drugs.\nAccording to an arrest citation, Joseph Jerome Fain is one of four men who barged into the apartment firing shots at the people inside.\nOnce inside, a witness told police that two people were taken at gunpoint while several others ran for safety. In the midst of the robbery, one victim was shot in the back and was later found by police at a nearby gas station.\nOne of the alleged robbers was also shot several times. Police believe Joseph Fain dropped that suspect off at the hospital later that night before running off.\nJoseph Fain was arrested at the Mason County jail but is now back in Lexington facing a first-degree robbery charge. He's due in court Friday afternoon.\nDemetrioun L. Boaz, another suspect, turned himself in shortly after the robbery."}
