The Dallas group blames members of the Allen group for the vandalism, a release from the Allen Police Department says.\nThe Facebook dispute lasted hours Tuesday evening until the Dallas group drove to Allen and continued the fight in the street. One Dallas man shot four of the Allen people, who were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\nDevonte Wade, 20, was arrested Wednesday on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Since then, four others involved in the fight have been arrested on misdemeanor warrants.\nThose involved appear to be young men and women in their late teens to early- to mid-20s, police said.\nAllen police continued to investigate, and those involved may face more charges.\nPolice asked that anyone with information call 214-509-4239, or send an anonymous text to 847411 with the keyword \u201cALLENPD.\u201d\nMark David Smith: 817-390-7808, @MarkSmith_FWST"}
