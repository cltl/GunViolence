He was in the back seat and she in the front when his .38-caliber revolver discharged. She died later that night at the hospital.\nMcIver has said the shooting was an accident. Atlanta police have been investigating for the better part of three months.\nThe involuntary manslaughter charge is a felony, police said. The reckless conduct charge is a misdemeanor.\n\u201cThis has completely destroyed his life,\u201d John \u201cSpike\u201d McIver, Tex\u2019s brother, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution this morning. \u201cThis was his life mate. They were inseparable. This was a horrible accident.\u201d\nSpike McIver said his brother called him last night to say that he\u2019d heard the warrants were being issued and that he was trying to arrange for booking at the jail.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very depressed about it,\u201d McIver said of his brother. \u201cHe keeps getting hit over and over from one direction and another. ... He\u2019s upset that this is occurring on Christmas week. They could\u2019ve waited, but they work in strange ways.\u201d\nMcIver\u2019s attorney, Steve Maples, told the AJC that the charges don\u2019t make sense to him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very, very disappointed,\u201d Maples said. \u201cWe feel it was an accident. Hopefully the grand jury would dismiss it when they hear the evidence.\n\u201cHe was not doing anything in a reckless or negligent manner.\u201d\nHe described his client as \u201cvery, very embarrassed and very, very humiiliated\u201d by the charges. \u201cTex said this was the second worst day of his life,\u201d Maples said.\nHe also noted that neither of the charges suggest that McIver had any malice toward his wife nor intent to cause her harm.\nAndrew Ward, a longtime friend of McIver\u2019s, said Wednesday that the couple adored each other.\u201c\nThis was a tragic accident. If it has to go through court to prove that, so be it,\u201d said Ward, who has known McIver for more than a decade. \u201cHe meant no harm to Diane. \u2026 I would not hesitate to be a witness in court to support their wonderful relationship.\u201d\nThursday will be McIver\u2019s 74th birthday, his lawyer said.\nTIMELINE\nFebruary 27, 1990: Three teenagers accuse Claud \u201cTex\u201d McIver of firing shots into the air and into their Ford Mustang outside his DeKalb County home.\nMay 1990: Tex McIver is indicted in DeKalb County on three counts of aggravated assault as well as other lesser charges in the shooting incident.
