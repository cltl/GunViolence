Eric Smitson told the Los Angeles Times there had been an exchange of gunfire between the man and deputies.\nThe man then ran between two cars and shot himself in the head, authorities said. A semi-automatic pistol was found lying next to his body.\nHe suffered \"significant\" injuries and placed on life support at a nearby hospital, but ultimately succumbed to his injuries, officials said.\nSky5 video over the scene showed a pool of blood directly outside the driver's side of a red truck in the Target parking lot. A section was cordoned off with yellow crime scene tape, and multiple law enforcement vehicles were at the location, according to the aerial footage.\nNo deputies were injured.\nAuthorities said they had not identified a motive for the man's actions. An investigation into the shooting was underway, and no additional information was immediately released.\nThe shooting occurred two days after Lancaster Sheriff's Station Sgt. Steve Owen was fatally shot while responding to a burglary call.\nTrenton Trevon Lovell \u201cimmediately\u201d opened fire on Owen, then stood over him and fired four additional rounds as he \"executed\" him, Sheriff Jim McDonald said Thursday.\nLovell, a 27-year-old resident of Lancaster, was arrested Wednesday and booked on suspicion of murder.\nKTLA's Meghan McMonigle contributed to this story."}
