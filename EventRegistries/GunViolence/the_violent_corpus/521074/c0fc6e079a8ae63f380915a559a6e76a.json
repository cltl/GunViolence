Three others had minor injuries.\nInterstate 880 was closed for roughly five hours as officers investigated.\nPassengers adamantly refused to give witness statements or provide descriptions of the shooters, authorities said.\n\u201cIn fact, they didn\u2019t cooperate so much that one of our officers got assaulted and kicked by one of the victims,\u201d Hill said.\nA female victim hit by a ricochet also got into an altercation with emergency medical personnel and forced her way out of an ambulance. She fled and her whereabouts are unknown.\nInvestigators say the bus was occupied by couples but Hill could not provide an estimate of how many people were on the bus. He declined to release names and ages of the wounded.\n\u201cI will say we don\u2019t believe this is a random incident,\u201d he said.\nPlease install the latest Adobe Flash Player Plugin to watch this content.\nThe incident is the eighth freeway shooting in the East Bay since November. Officers have blamed the shootings on an escalating gang war in the Richmond area where six of the shootings have taken place.\nFreeways are appealing because there are fewer surveillance cameras and easy getaways.\nHill said the CHP does not believe Saturday\u2019s shootout is specifically related to the other freeway shootings.\n\u00a9 Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
