Stahl, a sophomore at Medina High School, died in his home on Salt Works Road at about 5:30 p.m. Friday, Sheriff Scott D. Hess said.\nAn avid hunter, Jacob was looking at the shotgun in an upstairs bedroom with a 16-year-old friend when the gun accidentally went off, firing a shot that killed Jacob, authorities told The Buffalo News.\nThere is no indication of foul play, and the other teen \u2013 whose name has not been released \u2013 has \u201cfully cooperated\u201d in the ongoing investigation, the Sheriff\u2019s Office said.\nSo far, police have not disclosed any specifics about what caused the gun to go off, or who was handling the weapon when it fired.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d District Attorney Joseph V. Cardone said. \u201cFrom everything I have been told so far, it sounds like an accident \u2013 100 percent.\u201d\nCardone said he will have detailed discussions with police and Jacob\u2019s family before deciding whether to present the case to a grand jury. The Sheriff\u2019s Office said investigators are \u201creasonably certain\u201d that the death was a \u201ctragic accident that resulted from the careless handling of a loaded firearm.\u201d\nAccording to Hess, a 911 call came from the boy\u2019s home in the 5000 block of Salt Works Road Friday, and when deputies and first responders arrived, the teen was dead.\nMedina School officials will have grief counselors available to talk with students all this week, Superintendent Jeffrey Evoy told a reporter Saturday. The high school has 645 students.\n\u201cWe opened the high school today and we\u2019ve already had some students come in,\u201d Evoy said. \u201cThis is a small, close-knit school community, and this is an absolute tragedy. People are in a state of shock.\u201d\nJacob\u2019s friends knew him as \u201csomeone who loved the outdoors and loved hunting,\u201d Evoy said. \u201cHe had a close group of friends, and they talked about hunting a lot.\u201d\nCardone, who has been the county\u2019s chief prosecutor since 1992, said he has seen \u201ctoo many\u201d cases in which young people were killed through the unsafe handling of hunting weapons.\nCardone said he was reminded of a November 2003 incident in which a 17-year-old Albion boy accidentally shot and killed his 16-year-old best friend with an arrow fired by a hunting bow while the two were target shooting.\n\u201cIn this county, we have a lot of hunters with a lot of guns in a lot of households,\u201d Cardone said.\n\u201cYoung people have to be taught that you need to be very careful. Something like this has a tremendous impact, not only on the young person who is killed, but on the other person who was involved. And their families.\u201d\nemail: dherbeck@buffnews.com"}
