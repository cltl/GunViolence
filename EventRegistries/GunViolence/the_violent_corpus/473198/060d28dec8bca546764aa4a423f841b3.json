The department said it is \"seeking additional information that will help identify the shooter in this case.\"\nThe video, captured on a home surveillance system, shows a light-colored 2000 Chevrolet Impala, which is missing a rear driver side hubcap as it travels south on Steel Street. The car stops in front of the house, and an adult male gets out and begins shooting with a handgun before quickly getting back in the car and driving south on Steel.\nThe shooting happened about 8:15 p.m. on Dec. 27 and left Chanell Berry dead and her 8-year-old friend critically injured. A Free Press story in December said Chanell was playing with her Christmas presents \"when bullets flew through the living room window,\" striking the girls.\nThe senselessness of the shooting, believed to have been in response to an argument, prompted Chief James Craig to ask, \"When are we going to stand up and say enough is enough?'\"\nAnyone with information can call Crime Stoppers at 800-773-2587 (SPEAKUP).\nContact Eric D.
