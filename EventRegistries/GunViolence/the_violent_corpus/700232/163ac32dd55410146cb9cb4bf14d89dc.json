The murder charge has two allegations of using a firearm and lying in wait, which could lengthen his sentence if he\u2019s convicted.\nHe has not yet entered a plea. He is scheduled to appear in court Dec. 1 for an arraignment hearing. In the meantime, he is in jail in Riverside, and has been denied bail.\nOne of Burniston\u2019s friends, Donovan Ponce, said Thursday that hearing that Carter was accused of lying in wait cements in his mind a theory that Burniston had agreed to meet someone far from home \u2013 about 60 miles \u2013 to complete a sale, probably of car parts.\nBurniston was always trying to make money, Ponce, a former classmate at Millikan High in Long Beach, said Thursday.\n\u201cKnowing Eric, he wouldn\u2019t go out there for no reason,\u201d said Ponce, 21.\nRiverside County sheriff's officials have said little about the incident, and nothing about the relationship between Carter and Burniston. The criminal complaint offers a few new details, including that Burniston was shot.\nThe court documents also say Carter was in possession of a 9mm pistol on or about Nov. 11, and an AR-15 assault rifle on or about Nov. 13.\nBurniston\u2019s body was found near Mojeska Summit and Squaw Mountains roads, off I-15 near Temescal Canyon Road south of Corona. The area is just south of Tom\u2019s Farms and near a residential housing tract.\nCarter was arrested at 11:45 p.m. Saturday at the Moreno Valley sheriff\u2019s station and officially booked into jail early Sunday, records show. Sheriff's officials have not said what led investigators to suspect Carter.\nCarter was convicted in 2010 of identity theft in Los Angeles County, court documents say, and served prison time.\nBurniston was not the type of person likely to get into a violent disagreement, Ponce said.\n\u201cIf you did get into an argument, he was a rational thinker,\u201d Ponce said. \u201cHe would come up with an argument that was rational and not emotional.\u201d\nBurniston could fit in with any crowd at Millikan High \u2013 the cool kids, the \u201cthugs\u201d and the \u201cnerds,\u201d said Ponce, who added that Burniston was anything but a thug.\n\u201cThe way this happened was really bad, and Eric wasn\u2019t that type of dude. He was always talking about doing the right thing behind others\u2019 backs. (He would say) \u2018Let\u2019s just do things the right way.\u2019 He was a man of integrity and a man of his word,\u201d Ponce said.\nBurniston had a taste for nice cars and beamed with pride over his shiny blue Mustang, Ponce said. He always had his pit bull in the car and enjoyed showing off his wheels at car meets.\nBurniston\u2019s death, Ponce said, \u201cstill baffles me to this day. I just feel like whoever did that to him just had to be a person who didn\u2019t care about life and whatever consequence he was going to get for doing this to Eric \u2013 he didn\u2019t care.\u201d"}
