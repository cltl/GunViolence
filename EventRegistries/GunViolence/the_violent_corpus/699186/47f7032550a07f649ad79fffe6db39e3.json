Chris McIntire.\n\"It was a horrible accident,\" McIntire said.\nThe Muskegon County man who had mobility issues could no longer get into the woods to hunt, but he continued his annual tradition of preparing his guns, McIntire said.\n\"It's tradition for him to have his guns brought to him around hunting season so he can get them out and go through the whole process of cleaning them and getting them ready,\" McIntire said. \"And then the guns are put away until the next year.\"\nOn Nov. 8, his wife brought several of his guns to her husband, who spent most of his time in a chair, McIntire said.\nEmergency responders were called around noon to the home on Johnston Street in Dalton Township after the fatal accident, McIntire said. There was no indication it was a suicide nor a homicide, he said. The wife was present in the home at the time, he said.\n\"He was an 80-year-old who was in fair health,\" McIntire said. \"He got a lot of enjoyment spending time with his children and grandchildren.\"\nA good way to kick off your hunting season is to make sure your gun is sufficiently clean before trying to fire it."}
