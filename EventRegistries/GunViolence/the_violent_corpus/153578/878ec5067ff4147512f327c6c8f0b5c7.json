He got away in a dark-colored pick up truck, WCBS 880\u2019s Monica Miller reported.\nThe victim was rushed to Staten Island University Hospital.\nNeighbors were shaken up over the news. They said it\u2019s rare for the community to see this kind of violence.\n\u201cThis is a busy street, Amboy Road is busy, but it\u2019s not an area where you would have a shooting of any kind. I mean, we\u2019re here five years and this has never happened before,\u201d said one neighbor.\n\u201cWe have a baby. You know, we have a 5-year-old. It\u2019s very scary. This is unusual, very unusual for this area,\u201d said another neighbor.\nDawn said she got an early wake up call from police who rang her door bell after the victim was shot just steps from her door.\n\u201cWe just saw them yesterday. You know I\u2019m like this is very very strange and very scary, especially when you tell us a gun was shot. I said what!!\u201d Dawn said.\nNeighbors also said the victim only moved to the area a few months ago with his wife and son.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a man and his wife and their son. They\u2019re very quiet people. They just moved in not long ago. They\u2019re very nice people,\u201d neighbor Mike told WCBS 880\u2019s Miller.\nMike was just returning home from the night shift, only to find his house was on the part of the street that was sectioned off by police.\nThe shooting incident is just one of 13 that happened across the city in the last 24 hours, WCBS 880 reported.\nIn Cambria Heights, Queens, 33-year-old Bronx resident Jason Bragg was found shot to death around 10 p.m. Saturday.\nA 10-year-old boy and a male adult were shot in Coney Island at around 7 p.m. Saturday. Elhadi Abdel Rahman suffered minor injuries with a gunshot wound to his knee. The man was last listed in serious condition with a gunshot wound to his stomach. Police released a photo of the suspect.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they were gunshots. I thought they were firecrackers, but then everybody started running,\u201d Abdel Rahman said.\nHe was a block away from his home when he was caught in the middle of a spray of bullets, CBS 2\u2019s Don Champion reported.\nOne person was killed and two others were injured in a shooting at 92 Tapscott St. in Brooklyn.\nAlso in Brooklyn, a female was shot in the leg at 1780 Bergen St. She was taken to Kings County Hospital.\nFour people were shot at Fifth Avenue and West 139th street.

We\u2019re still well behind what we had last year for this week,\u201d the commissioner said.\nInvestigations into the violent weekend continue, and the NYPD is pouring over statistics to determine if the end of the stop and frisk policy has led to an increase in the number of guns on city streets.\nIn the last week there have been 23 shooting incidents, compared to 37 in the same period last year.\nCheck Out These Other Stories From CBSNewYork.com:"}
