He is being held at Limestone County Jail with bail set at $5,000.\nLimestone County Sheriff's Office spokesman Stephen Young said deputies responded to Canchola's residence at 16931 Buckskin Drive at 12:06 a.m. Sunday.\n\"Everybody was saying it sounded like someone was shooting down the street,\" Young said of the 30 people at the scene. \"I guess maybe that was believable, except eventually some of the children there came forward.\"\nThe children said Canchola had been shooting in the yard to celebrate New Year's and that he had run off on foot after the girl was hit. When Sheriff Mike Blakely and an investigator found him at about 7:15 a.m. Sunday, Young said, Canchola's story was consistent with what the children had said.\nCanchola said he had run away after the shooting because he was scared, Young said."}
