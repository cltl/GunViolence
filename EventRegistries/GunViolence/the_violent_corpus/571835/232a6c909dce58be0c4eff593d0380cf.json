A school police officer spotted two teens in a fight.\nPolice released video of the suspect before he tried to rob a 17-year-old senior at the high school at gunpoint. The victim fought back.\n\u201cDuring this struggle, with the suspect\u2019s gun, the suspect fired the gun and struck himself. So this appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound that the suspect caused on his own, and the suspect fled the scene,\u201d said T.J. Smith, Baltimore Police Department.\nThe victim was then able to disarm the suspect and get away.\nPolice are hoping anyone with information about the would-be-robber comes forward. He should be suffering from a gunshot wound.\nPolice say the would-be-victim was going to Douglass to pick up his cap and gown for graduation."}
