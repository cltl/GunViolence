It's still unclear to whom the gun belongs, whether it was properly secured or how the boy got hold of it.\n\"We're going to investigate this and try to find out exactly what happened. Right now, our thoughts and our prayers go out to the child and his family,\u201d Port Orange Police Chief Thomas Grimaldi told WESH 2.\n>>Download the WESH 2 News app for iOS and Android\nPolice say the 12-year-old did not witness the shooting but heard it and ran to get a neighbor who called 911, but it was the 12-year-old who performed CPR, trying to save his brother. A relative, who drove in from Jacksonville, said he learned life saving techniques from a firefighter cousin.\nWESH 2 News learned the great-grandfather, though in the house, is bedridden and was unable to help. Rescuers arrived and took over, but the boy later died. His mother, who wasn't at home at the time, was with her son at the hospital and, according to police, is cooperating with the investigation.\nLinnea Heddle, who lives two doors down told WESH 2 the family is amazing.\n\"They're wonderful, caring people. The kids are so well behaved. They\u2019re just wonderful. This is horrible tragedy. It's horrible.\""}
