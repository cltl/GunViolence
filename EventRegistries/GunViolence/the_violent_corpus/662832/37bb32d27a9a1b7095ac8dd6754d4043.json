Police said he was an innocent bystander when the gunfire broke out.\n\"It's one of those circumstances that really tug at your heart to know that someone under the age of 5 is the victim of violence,\" Birmingham police Sgt. Bryan Shelton said.\n\"That's the fifth birthday you won't see, the sixth birthday you won't see, graduations. It's a tough time for that family. So we're going to do our due diligence to make sure that family gets answers and has justice,\" Shelton continued.\nAuthorities believe the suspect went to the little boy's home to confront some adults about a phone their kids had been arguing about.\nBoth parties started shooting, and Ferguson was shot. He died at the hospital.\nThe suspect fled from the scene and has not been identified. Police believe a vehicle was involved, but don't know if it was a drive-by shooting.\n\"Obviously it was senseless, pointless,\" Shelton said.\nPolice are asking anyone with information to call them.\nCopyright 2016 WBRC.
