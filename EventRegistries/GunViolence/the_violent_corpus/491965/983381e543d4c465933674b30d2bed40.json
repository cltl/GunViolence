However, Police News Affairs Officer Daniel O\u2019Brien denied that anyone was in custody, adding there is \u201cmisinformation out there.\u201d\nChicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy earlier said investigators believe, from shell casings found at the scene, that an assault weapon was used in the attack.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic how things kind of come together. You\u2019ve heard me talk about assault weapons. It looks like there was an assault weapon used in that shooting last night,\u201d said McCarthy.\n\u201cThese are not things that belong in an urban setting. There\u2019s no reason for them in a free society. That\u2019s a military-grade weapon that was created to kill people during combat.\nThat corner is located along the \u201cSafe Passage\u201d route for students attending Joseph Brennemann Elementary School, which is receiving students who attended Graeme Stewart Elementary School, which was one of 49 elementary schools shut down by the Chicago Public Schools this summer. Stewart Elementary is around the corner from the shooting, on Kenmore Avenue, just south of Wilson.\nPlease install the latest Adobe Flash Player Plugin to watch this content.\nPolice sources said three of the victims are gang members. Two were innocent bystanders. Police sources said three different gangs in the area have been fighting for territory.\nUptown Baptist Church Pastor Michael Allen said he heard the shooting was the result of one gang placing a hit on a rival gang member.\n\u201cHe happened to be standing where a group of others were standing, and so folks were caught in the melee,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThat\u2019s just tragic.\u201d\nAll the victims of the shooting were men, their ages ranging from 21 to 58. The youngest victim was shot in the head.\nThe victims\u2019 conditions ranged from extremely critical to critical to good, the Chicago Fire Department said in a Twitter posting. Police initially said one person died in the shooting, but later said that victim was in extremely critical condition at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center.\nWitnesses said a white 4-door car pulled up in front of the church, and someone inside opened fire.\n\u201cI heard what I thought was fireworks,\u201d said Joe Rogers, who was working security at the Uptown Shop and Save at the corner of Wilson and Sheridan when he heard the gun shots.\nAllen said the church was hosting a prayer service at the time, and giving out meals to more than 100 homeless people.\n\u201cWe heard the barrage of shots outside. There must have been at least 15 to 20 shots fired, and then after that, I went out to find out what was going on, and just saw carnage at the base of the church steps,\u201d he said.\nAllen said pools of blood and the wounded victims lay just outside the church doors after the shooting.\n\u201cI do believe at least two or three of the victims had either just come into the sanctuary, or to our meal, or were just leaving the Monday night meal,\u201d Allen said.\nRogers said there was blood everywhere. He saw a white car speeding away from the scene.\n\u201cI see three people down on the ground; one on his back, one on his side, and one is face down,\u201d said Rogers.\nWith his church sitting along the border between two or three gangs, Allen said he\u2019s committed to the community.\n\u201cThis kind of stuff doesn\u2019t scare us off. We\u2019re just going to redouble our efforts to love on the community, and show the love of God to people,\u201d he said.\nNo one was in custody for the shooting as of Tuesday morning. Police were reviewing video from a blue light surveillance camera near the scene.\nIt was the second time in little more than a week that there was a shooting along a designated \u201cSafe Passage\u201d route for a public school. However, neither shooting happened during school hours, when the program\u2019s volunteers, paid \u201cSafe Passage\u201d workers, police officers, and other city employees will be manning the routes to keep kids safe going to and from school.\nPlease install the latest Adobe Flash Player Plugin to watch this content.\nMayor Rahm Emanuel said, starting Monday, there 600 newly trained Safe Passage workers, and hundreds more volunteers keeping watch over the routes, including at Sheridan and Wilson.\n\u201cIt is our obligation, not just because we work for the taxpayers \u2013 although we have a primary \u2013 it\u2019s the obligation of every adult to make sure a child is protected. Whether you\u2019re employed, or a city employee, or not,\u201d he said.\nChicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett noted there\u2019s much more to the Safe Passage routes than simply placing yellow signs designating certain streets as part of the program.\n\u201cSafe Passage is not just the geographic passage where children walk, it\u2019s a comprehensive strategy \u2026 involving multiple resources of the sister agencies,\u201d she said.\nIn addition to having police officers and firefighters helping keep an eye on the Safe Passage routes, the city\u2019s Buildings Department has secured or demolished 300 abandoned buildings on or near the routes; animal control workers will be on the lookout for dangerous dogs along the paths; Streets and Sanitation Department employees have been cleaning up vacant lots; and Park District workers will provide security at public parks along the routes.\nAltogether, representatives from 16 city agencies will play a role in the program once classes begin on Aug. 26.\nThe other shooting on a Safe Passage route happened in Bronzeville on Aug. 11, when one man was killed and another was wounded in the 2900 block of South State Street."}
