By nightfall, a relative told CBS4\u2019s Donna Rapado that the child had died.\n\u201cWe feel the same way you guys feel, and the rest of this community,\u201d Perez added. \u201cWe\u2019re in awe that this happened. These tragic events need to stop. Look around, there\u2019s neighbors standing out here, kids playing in the front yard. Just like the child that was hit. Those bullets could\u2019ve gone anywhere. Senseless violence within our community. It\u2019s been a quiet summer. And now as school starts, we\u2019re gonna start up again. This is ridiculous.\u201d\nAlberto Carvalho, the Miami-Dade Public Schools Superintendent, has been very outspoken and outraged by all the gun violence involving children.\nPlease stop what you\u2019re doing, bow your head, close your eyes. An 8-year old baby girl was shot in the head. Unspeakable carnage must end.\nMiami-Dade Police have upped the reward for information leading to the killers\u2019 capture by $20,000, making the total reward to $23,000.\nIf you know anything, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS. As always, tipsters can remain anonymous."}
