Mahalick said the wounded Texan spilled little blood as he left the lobby to await paramedics outside.\n\"Almost all of the blood was kept in his shoe,\" he said. \"There was one drop of blood in the lobby and that was it.\"\nHanover Township EMS and Bethlehem Township paramedics rushed to the scene and checked the injury. Hanover EMS took the man to the hospital.\n\"He'll probably be in there for a little while,\" Mahalick said.\nThe man will not be charged, he said.\n\"It was an accident,\" he explained. \"Nobody else was hurt. No one else was in danger. He has his concealed-carry license, reciprocating with Pennsylvania.\"\nThe man was checking into the hotel as part of his relocation from Texas for a job, Mahalick said.\n\u2014 Frank Warner"}
