Now, the suspect may be headed to Richmond.\nEarl Valentine went to the Norlina, NC home of his ex-wife, Keisha Valentine, around 1:30 a.m. He then shot her and her 15-year-old son before leaving, according to Norlina Police Chief Taylor Bartholomew.\nThe son was able to tell dispatchers he was shot by his father before he died from the gunshot wound. Keisha is in critical but stable condition. She had moved to Norlina to get away from Earl according to Chief Bartholomew.\nAfter the shooting, Earl Valentine posted a video to Facebook, confessing to killing his ex-wife. He said, \"I love my wife, but she deserved what she had coming.\"\nKeisha is from the Richmond-area and still has family here, so law enforcement throughout the area is being asked to keep an eye out for Earl Valentine.
