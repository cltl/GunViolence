Officers found a man and woman dead with apparent gunshot wounds, police said.\nTheir children \u2014 a 4-year-old boy and 3-year-old girl \u2014 also suffered gunshot wounds and were taken to University Medical Center in stable condition with nonlife-threatening injuries, police said.\nIt was not clear whether the mother or father fired the shots or whether the 3-year-old girl and 4-year-old boy were intended targets, North Las Vegas police spokeswoman Ann Cavaricci said.\nPolice said they believe the incident was domestic related, and they were not looking for any other suspects.\nAuthorities have not identified the family.\nEmployees were at the Kids Campus Learning Center as it opened, but no other children were around when the shooting happened around 6:10 a.m. in the front parking lot, police said. No one else was hurt at the preschool and day care.\nThe workers initially cared for the children and reported the shooting to police, Cavaricci said.\n\"They opened the doors and brought the children inside, called 911,\" she said. \"They did everything they could to make sure those kids were safe.\"\nThe center declined to comment.\nCavaricci said the children attend daycare at the center. A child protective services agency is working to find relatives to help care for them.\nOnly a few employees were at work at the time of the shooting, and no other children were at the daycare at the time, Cavaricci said.\nPolice said they don't believe there was an exchange of gunfire because only one weapon was recovered at the scene.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}
