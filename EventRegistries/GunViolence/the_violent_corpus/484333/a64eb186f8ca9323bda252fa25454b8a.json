WARREN\nThe Associated Press\nGunfire erupted at a Federal Way apartment complex Sunday night where five people were shot to death, including a suspect who was shot by arriving officers, police said.\nOfficers responding to an emergency call at 9:30 p.m. at the Pine Village Apartments encountered a chaotic scene, with bullets flying.\n\u201cWhen officers arrived there were still shots being fired,\u201d said Federal Way police spokeswoman Cathy Schrock.\nThey found two wounded men on the ground in a parking lot. One of the men reached for a gun as police moved in to assist the two, she said.\nAt that point, officers opened fire. The suspect died but police said it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if it was from their gunfire.\nThe other man on the ground and a third man in the parking lot were found dead.\nIn a search of the complex, police found a fourth man dead in one apartment and a slain woman in another unit. Schrock said police were trying to determine if the woman was hit by a stray bullet.\nA total of eight officers fired their weapons, Schrock said. All have been placed on administrative leave, per standard policy, as the investigation continues.\nThere was no immediate word what set off the shooting. Police scheduled a briefing for late Monday morning.\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have any idea what started this disturbance tonight,\u201d Schrock said.\nAfter police flooded the area and carried out searches, authorities said they were confident there were no more casualties from the shooting.\nThey said they did not think another shooter was on the loose or that there was an immediate threat to the public.\nThere were no reports of any officers being injured. The names of the five people killed were not immediately available.\nOfficers were using a metal detector to search a grassy bank across the street from the apartment complex this morning.\nKristina Braun, 23, said she, her husband and 3-year-old daughter went to the movies and dinner yesterday, arriving about home 9:30 p.m.\n\u201cWe saw and heard a ton of ambulances and police cars everywhere,\u201d she said this morning.\nHer family was still not allowed to return to their apartment this morning, awaiting police to give the OK.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually really calm, normally \u2026 This is the first huge issue,\u201d said Braun, who\u2019s lived in the complex for two years. She said about 6 months ago, a lot of police showed up for the robbery at a nearly grocery.\nSung Yang, who runs a motel nearby, said he and residents heard the gunfire.\n\u201cI heard gunshots. Lot of gunshots. It was scary,\u201d Yang said.\nThere was a series of shots at first and then after about 10 minutes, more shooting, he said.\n\u201cEverybody staying here came out to see what it was,\u201d but they got little information.\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived here five and a half or six years and I\u2019ve never had a problem. I just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d said Kelly Burki, a resident of the complex.\nBurki, 51, was out for the evening and was returning home about 11 p.m. to find her street closed by police. She said she was told she could return home in a couple of hours, but at 8 a.m today, police still had the street closed.\nBurki said she is a bartender who frequently doesn\u2019t get home until around 2:30 a.m. \u201cBut even at that hour, I\u2019ve always felt safe. I\u2019ve never fear.\u201d\nSeattle Times staff reporter Jack Broom contributed to this report."}
