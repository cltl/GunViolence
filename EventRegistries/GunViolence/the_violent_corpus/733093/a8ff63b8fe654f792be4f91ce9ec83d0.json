(CBS4) \u2013 A 14-year-old boy who was shot inside a home in Littleton on Friday afternoon is fighting for his life, and a 15-year-old is in custody in the case.\nThe teen who was hurt was described as being in critical condition on Saturday morning. That\u2019s the word from the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office, who also said the suspect was arrested on suspicion of 1st degree assault.\nDeputies found the injured teen at the home, which is located near the intersection of West Bowles Avenue and South Simms Street. He was taken immediately to the hospital.\nThe 15-year-old suspect allegedly fled from the scene and was taken into custody by deputies a mile away near Dakota Ridge Apartments.\n\u201cWe do know that the two teenage boys knew one another, that possibly they were good friends,\u201d said Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s spokesman Mark Techmeyer.\nInvestigators say they have conducted several interviews in an attempt to figure out what led to the shooting. They said Friday night it\u2019s unclear so far if the shooting was accidental or intentional and it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if any adults were home at the time.\nNeighbors CBS4 interviewed said they are hoping and praying for the best after the incident.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very shocking and surprising,\u201d one neighbor said. \u201cI hope that the boy that was injured comes out of this okay.\u201d"}
