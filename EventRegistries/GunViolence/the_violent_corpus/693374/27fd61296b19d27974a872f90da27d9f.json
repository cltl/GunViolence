Both suffered gunshot wounds and were in stable condition.\nPolice reported that six others \u2014 four women and two men ranging from 17 to 28 years old \u2014 had been shot. One was in critical condition, while the others were in stable condition.\nA large crowd had gathered on the street outside a nightclub when some type of confrontation took place, authorities said. Police who were in the area on a separate call heard the gunshots and responded to the scene.\n\u201cWhen officers arrived on scene, multiple victims were medically transported to local hospitals,\u201d the statement said.\nThe shooting was the second big jolt in a week to a city that has struggled to chip away at its homicide rate. On Thursday, Oakland police found the badly burned body of a 21-year-old Alameda County Sheriff\u2019s volunteer in Arroyo Viejo Park.\nThe events rattled Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who has made public safety a top priority.\n\u201cThis week has been heartbreaking,\u201d Schaaf said in an interview Saturday.\n\u201cWhile we are working so hard to address violence in this city, and feel encouraged by a more than 40 percent reduction in shootings and homicides over the past four years, this week shows how much work we have to do,\u201d she said.\nCity Council President Lynette Gibson McElhaney expressed concern that the city does not have enough police officers patrolling the downtown corridor at night.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a robust nightlife and not staff it appropriately,\u201d said McElhaney. For her, the gun violence in Oakland has personal dimensions: Last year a 17-year-old boy whom McElhaney considered a grandson was gunned down in West Oakland.\nPolice are investigating Saturday\u2019s shooting.\nHamed Aleaziz and Rachel Swan are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.
