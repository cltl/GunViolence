Lonaker sat at his computer, his back to his 6-year-old son. His wife was also turned away as she put their baby down.\nNeither of them noticed the little boy approach the table where Lonaker had left his .38 revolver. No one watched as he picked it up, the weapon clumsy and cold in his tiny hands. And no one saw him pull the trigger, sending a bullet flying toward his father.\nWhen deputies arrived at the Lonaker home in Hartsville, Ind., on Sunday night, Bartholomew County Sheriff Matt Myers said, they found the 62-year-old father dying of a gunshot wound to his upper body and the boy disconsolate at what he\u2019d inadvertently done.\n\u201cWe can tell his heart is broken,\u201d Juli Lonaker, James Lonaker\u2019s adult daughter from a previous marriage, told the Johnson County, Ind., Daily Journal.\nLonaker, who was not named in the sheriff\u2019s statement but has been identified by family members, died en route to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis.\nChild Protective Services has been notified about the incident, which is still under investigation, Myers said.\n\u201cPlease keep your guns in a secure location out of reach of children,\u201d his statement implored. \u201cThis was a tragic accident. Please make certain that firearms in your homes are not accessible to anyone \u2014 especially children. Many firearms accidents in the home can be prevented simply by making sure that firearms are kept unloaded and safely stored, with ammunition secured in a separate location. Please keep your guns in a secure location out of reach of children.\n\u201cThis is a tragedy that is told and retold all across the country and a tragedy that can be avoided.\u201d\nLonaker\u2019s death is at least the 18th accidental shooting by an American child under age 10 this year, according to a Washington Post survey of news reports. Six of those incidents were fatal, and in every other one, the victim was also a child. In three cases, the person killed was the child who accidentally pulled the trigger.\nLast year, at least 265 people were shot by kids under age 18, according to data compiled by the gun-control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.\nEach shooting is simultaneously deeply shocking and heartbreaking its banality. There is the 5-year-old from Missouri who shot herself in the leg with a gun she found underneath her grandmother\u2019s couch; the woman had stashed it there to hide it from her grandchildren when they arrived at her house. There\u2019s the 3-year-old boy who accidentally killed himself with a pistol that his parents didn\u2019t even know was in their home, and the 8-year-old who was trying to unload the semiautomatic pistol his siblings had found in their mother\u2019s purse, when the gun discharged, fatally shooting his 7-year-old brother in the head.\nAnd then there\u2019s Lonaker\u2019s 6-year-old son.\nThe little boy was in the bedroom with both of his parents, Juli Lonaker told the Daily Journal, when he picked up the revolver. Lonaker was changing his clothes, and he had put the gun down on top of a table and mini fridge. Then he turned to do something on his computer.\nHis wife, Jenny Rose Lonaker, heard the \u201cpop\u201d of the weapon firing, but she didn\u2019t register it as a gunshot, the Daily Journal reported. She looked up to see her husband bleeding from a bullet wound to his chest.\nThe 6-year-old told investigators that he didn\u2019t mean to hurt his father and that he didn\u2019t think the gun was loaded when he fired it, Myers said.\nNow, the Lonaker family is left to figure out how to comfort a little boy who lost his father at his own hand.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want this incident to define him or his future,\u201d Juli Lonaker told the Daily Journal.\n\u201cSome of the headlines used the word \u2018killed'; my little brother is not a killer,\u201d she said in an interview with local TV station WISH. \u201cMy little brother is a little boy who likes to play and have fun, and he is a good, good little boy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear how much the 6-year-old can be protected from what happened. For now, when he talks about his father, he tells relatives that \u201chis daddy is in heaven,\u201d she said.\nSpeaking to WISH, Lonaker\u2019s other adult child, James, explained that he and his sister have agreed to interviews for their young half-brother\u2019s well-being. People need to understand what happened, he said.\nThe 6-year-old \u201cshould not have been in a situation where he could\u2019ve got his hands\u201d on a gun, he said.\nThe two adult Lonaker children told WISH that their father had a concealed-carry permit for the revolver.\nSpeaking to WRTV, James \u2014 who also goes by Corky \u2014 said that his father ran a boxing gym in nearby Hope, Ind. He was known for his generosity and for welcoming in anyone who wanted to work out.\n\u201cWhether they had any money to pay for the uniforms, my dad provided shoes, clothes, anything. Roofs over their head. He just could not stand for kids to go without,\u201d he said.\nJames E. Lonaker had grown up poor in Austin, Ind., his son told the Daily Journal. He was one of seven children living in a one-bedroom house, and he was accustomed scarcity.\nThat made him generous, and adventurous, friends and family said. Tony Ault, who once trained with Lonaker, recalled traveling across the country and the world with him for boxing matches.\n\u201cHe was a really good boxing coach,\u201d Ault told the Daily Journal. \u201cHe was just a really good friend. He was always willing to help in the community.\u201d\nLonaker raised his older children in Hope, Ind., about an hour south of Indianapolis, and moved to nearby Hartsville when he remarried. He had plans to build a resort in the Philippines, James Lonaker Jr. told the Daily Journal \u2014 a characteristically ambitious scheme.\n\u201cNo one lived as well, or as hard or as fast as my dad,\u201d his son said. \u201cHe lived life as though he was very rich, even though he wasn\u2019t.\u201d"}
