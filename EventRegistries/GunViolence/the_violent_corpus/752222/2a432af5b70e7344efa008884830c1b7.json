(WSVN) - Police and fire rescue crews are on the scene after eight people were shot during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park.\nAccording to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, three juveniles and three adults were shot, and two other juveniles were grazed by bullets. The two juveniles who were grazed were treated on the scene and released to their parents.\nMiami-Dade Police was among the multiple agencies that responded to the scene of the shooting, at 6011 N.W. 32nd Ave., in Northwest Miami-Dade, Monday, just before 4 p.m.\nThe victims, five children and three adults, ranged in age between 11 to 30 years old.\nMiami-Dade Police searched for the shooters in nearby homes. At around 5:20 p.m., officers confirmed they had detained two people for questioning and recovered two weapons from the scene.\n\u201cI now can report that we have two people detained and are being questioned by our detectives,\u201d Detective Marjoria Eloi said, \u201cand we have two firearms that have been detained.\u201d\nfirst police officers on scene clearing NW 32nd Avenue after the shooting. @wsvn pic.twitter.com/rvZcSVN9dm\n7News reporter Ann Keil and photographers were about 100 feet away from the scene of the shooting, along Northwest 32nd Avenue and Northwest 62nd Street. They heard between four and six shots.\nMoments later, the news crew saw displaced children crying after losing their parents when a stampede of attendees ran away from the scene in search of safety. Many police officers were seen carrying small children away from the scene.\nAs all of this was going on, parade-goers were seen ducking for cover underneath vendor tables and behind walls. \u201cYou also had people who, in the panic of it all, were injured in the stampede,\u201d said Eloi.\nAt one moment, six MDPD officers entered a nearby house with their guns drawn. It is unclear if this is related to the shooting at the park. The officers did not leave the home with anyone.\nAccording to Keil, at least two women looked like they had been shot in the leg. Officers were seen picking up these victims by hand and carrying them away to safety.\nMoments later, a man was seen on the floor in handcuffs.\n\u201c[This happened] too close to home,\u201d said witness Tammy Meeks, who was attending the celebration with her family. \u201cI mean, I had my son out here, my nieces and nephews were here, and my main concern was to make sure they were OK. My main goal was to get down and cover them, so they wouldn\u2019t be harmed. It\u2019s terrible. I mean, this is supposed to be Martin Luther King Day. This should be one of the one days out of the year where whether you\u2019re white, black, Hispanic \u2014 no matter what you are \u2014 we come together and just have fun and care for one another, and it\u2019s senseless that we can\u2019t just do that on one day of the year.\u201d\nBy 4:30 p.m., only a few vendors were left packing up their belongings and tents, visibly disappointed and disheartened after the peaceful day took a violent turn.\n\u201cA day like today, we were not going to tolerate this,\u201d said Eloi, \u201cand we\u2019re gonna continue to investigate and hopefully find some closure for these victims.\u201d\nIn order to clear the area, police officers formed a line to block off anyone from going near the scene.\nGeral Frazier, the aunt of one of the juveniles, described the immediate chaos after the shooting. \u201cThey were still shooting, and the ambulance couldn\u2019t leave, \u201d Frazier said. \u201cEverybody just running and screaming.\u201d\nMLK parade and festival in NW Miami Dade turns into shooting scene. @wsvn pic.twitter.com/eG0lznurPN\nFive of the six hospitalized victims are listed in stable condition, according to MDPD. Another victim, 20-year-old Gerome Battle, had to undergo two surgeries and is listed in critical condition.\nCameron Beacham found out on Facebook that his cousin, Battle, had been shot.\n\u201cRight now they just said he\u2019s in surgery,\u201d Beacham said. \u201cHe was shot in the leg, and I\u2019m hearing it went through the back.\u201d\nThe two younger victims, an 11 and 13 year-old were treated on the scene and released to their parents.\nA day that had started out on a high note, quickly took a terrifying turn, prompting Miami-Dade Police Director to take to Twitter.\n@MiamiDadePD shameful closing to the MLK Parade. Certainly not what the followers of Dr. King Jr. want out of our community.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even get together and stuff on a peaceful day anymore,\u201d said Frazier. \u201cIt\u2019s sad.\u201d\nThe investigation is ongoing.\nIf you have any information on this shooting, call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS.
