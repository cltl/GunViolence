LOUIS, Mo. (KMOV.com) -\nThe family of a girl who was shot in an alleged road rage shooting spoke about the ordeal.\nThe girl, 3, was shot in the leg when her father, who was driving, honked at a black Ford F150 that got too close to his car. Someone inside the F150 then opened fire, the father said.\nOne bullet went through the car\u2019s backdoor as the child held a teddy bear. The child was shot in the leg. The family says she is doing well and only has a bandage on her calf.\n\u201cIt came in the back and came out the front,\u201d said one of the girl\u2019s parents. That bullet, a parent said, grazed the girl in the leg.\nThe girl\u2019s mother was in the front seat.\n\u201cI dropped down to the bottom of the seat and then jumped him to snatch her and pulled her to the front of the car,\u201d said the girl\u2019s mother.\nAnother bullet hit the car\u2019s gas tank.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t doing anything,\u201d the mother said. \"I can see if we were doing something, but we weren\u2019t doing anything.\u201d\nThe family said it will not honk at other drivers anymore.\nCopyright 2016 KMOV (Meredith Corporation).
