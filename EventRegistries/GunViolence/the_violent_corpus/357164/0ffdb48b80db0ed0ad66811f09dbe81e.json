Harrison, age 35, and Tyajah N. Nelson, age 18, that occurred in the basement of Ballour\u2019s house located in the 1600 block of E. Hudson Street in South Linden.\nWade and his co-defendant Robert Lee Adams, age 27 (at the time of the murders) robbed the victims, ordered them to the basement, and Adams then shot the victims, murdering four of them and wounding a fifth individual. After the shooting Adams and Wade fled the scene. One of the five victims survived the shooting and stumbled from the residence where she sought help. Wade was picked up shortly thereafter.\nAdams could face the death penalty if convicted during his trial scheduled for January. Wade wasn\u2019t eligible for the death penalty because he\u2019s a juvenile.\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
