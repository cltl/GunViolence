The Madison County Coroner\u2019s Office plans to release his identity on Tuesday following an autopsy, said Maj. Jeff Connor, deputy commander of the Major Case Squad of St. Louis in Illinois.\nThe boy was a resident of Alton Acres.\n\u201cIt was just kids standing outside, waiting to go to basketball practice,\u201d said Greg Denton, executive director of the Alton Housing Authority shortly after the shooting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sad. They were just standing outside. I\u2019m praying he will be alright,\u201d Denton said shortly after the 5:16 p.m. shooting, prior to the boy being pronounced dead. Denton also is a minister.\nAlton Police Chief Jason \u201cJake\u201d Simmons referred reporters\u2019 questions to Connor.\nDuring a briefing with the media at 9:40 p.m., Connor said the investigation still was early and urged anyone with information on the killing to call Alton police at (618) 463-3505. At that point, Connor said investigators only know the shooter was inside a red car, of unknown make or style. He could not confirm the boy was shot in the arm, as reported on police radio, until after the autopsy.\n\u201cThese kids were not causing any trouble at all,\u201d Connor said of the group at which the gunman fired. He said it is difficult to understand why someone would shoot an 11 year old. \u201cIt shows the disregard for human life. Multiple people could have been hit.\u201d\nConnor said 20 detectives, who had assembled in the Investigations Bureau at the upper level of the Donald E. Sandidge Alton Law Enforcement Center, were ready to go out and interview anyone with information.\n\u201cWe are trying to locate as many witnesses as we can,\u201d he said.\nSeveral people called 911 at 5:16 p.m. to report shots fired from a car near the community center, on the corner of Acorn Street and the 3100 block of Paul Street. Scanner traffic reported an \u201c8-year-old\u201d gunshot wound victim, with numerous people fleeing the area. Police radio said the boy was conscious and breathing, then it said he reportedly lost consciousness and police were performing cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Authorities later revised the victim\u2019s age to 11 years old.\nElijah Harris, 17, of Godfrey, said he was playing basketball on the outdoor court when he heard about three shots fired but did not see where they came from. The youths playing basketball ran off, except for the young victim, who had fallen. Harris said he saw a chest wound, picked up the fatally wounded child and carried him inside the community center.\nParamedics from the Alton Fire Department were nearby on standby until police verified the scene was secure. The paramedics then came to the center and treated the child until an ambulance arrived at 5:30 p.m., taking him to a local hospital emergency room.\nAuthorities called APD detectives and two deputies from the Madison County Sheriff\u2019s Department to assist in interviewing numerous witnesses at the scene before the Major Case Squad was activated.\nAlton police have a live feed from security cameras posted at Alton Acres and Oakwood Estates complexes, both operated and maintained by the Alton Housing Authority, which Connor said investigators are examining.\nAfter detectives interviewed Harris, his mother Tara Wheeler said she is tired of violence and wants the killer to turn himself into police.\n\u201cAll of these killings, it\u2019s terrible,\u201d she said, acknowledging her son could have been the shooting victim. \u201cThe killings need to stop. Alton needs to get together and get something for these kids to do, there\u2019s nothing to do.\u201d\nShe said the shooter may think he got away with his crime, but God knows what he did.\n\u201cYou should come down here,\u201d she said to the killer from inside the police station lobby.\nWheeler, though, is proud her son who tried to help save the wounded child.\n\u201cHe helped the baby out of it, he was marvelous. He got the baby back inside, but he (victim) passed. I\u2019m very grateful he didn\u2019t get shot. It could have been him.\u201d\nReach Linda N. Weller at 618-208-6450 or on Twitter @Linda_Weller"}
