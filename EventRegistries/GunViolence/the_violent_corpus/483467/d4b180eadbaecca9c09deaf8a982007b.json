Ford, 18, of the 400 block of Emerald Avenue in Alton, with two counts of first degree murder in Monday\u2019s shooting of Romell L. Jones, of the 3100 block of Paul Street. The shooting was in front of the Alton Acres public housing complex community center, at Paul and Acorn streets.\nThe charges identify the boy as \u201cRonnell,\u201d which his family said is misspelled on his birth certificate, with his correct and preferred name being, \u201cRomell.\u201d The warrant also says Romell was shot in the back, although the Madison County Coroner\u2019s press release previously said he suffered one gunshot wound to the chest.\nJudge Richard Tognarelli denied bond for Ford, who authorities arrested Thursday morning. He was at Alton City Jail on Thursday afternoon, awaiting transfer to the Madison County Jail in Edwardsville.\nPolice declined to say where they located Ford or the car from which he is suspected of shooting at the crowd of young people. Police had the vehicle towed Wednesday afternoon to the sally port on the upper level of the Donald E. Sandidge Alton Law Enforcement Center for processing.\nMaj. Jeff Connor, deputy commander of the multi-agency Major Case Squad of Greater St. Louis in Illinois, discussed the investigation Thursday afternoon at a press conference at the law enforcement center, 1700 E. Broadway. He called the crime \u201cheart-wrenching.\u201d\nConnor was flanked by more than 25 members of the Case Squad from 15 agencies in Southern Illinois, Madison County State\u2019s Attorney Tom Gibbons and Chief Jason \u201cJake\u201d Simmons of the Alton Police Department.\nJones\u2019s family sat in the rear pews of the satellite courtroom, quietly listening to the officials.\nAfterward, the boy\u2019s father, Robert Jones, 32, of St. Louis, said he is glad the suspect is off the street. \u201cI\u2019m glad justice is served, but it is not going to bring my son back.\u201d He said he is shocked his innocent son was killed over a social media dispute. \u201cIt was very senseless.\u201d\nWhen asked what his favorite memories are of Romell, he didn\u2019t hesitate, quietly answering: \u201cHis heart, his smile and how he was excited to wake up and go to school and play sports. That\u2019s what we talked about all the time.\u201d\nNeither Jones nor mother Sonya Dixon, 29, who lives across from the community center, knows Ford. She has eight other children.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they got him, and we still have a long recovery to go, but this is a start,\u201d Dixon said, but said she is \u201cnot surprised at all\u201d her son senselessly was killed over a social media dispute.\n\u201cI just want to thank everyone, the Major Case Squad detectives and the Alton Police Department, for bringing my son\u2019s killer into custody,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long process but I\u2019m focusing on burying my son and moving forward.\u201d\nConnor said an online dispute between two people, including on Facebook, sparked plans for an \u201canticipated fight,\u201d but not involving guns or young Romell. He declined to describe nature of the dispute.\n\u201cIt is believed that Ford was coming to the scene to confront those individuals involved in the dispute,\u201d Gibbons also said.\nAuthorities said Ford, who was inside a red, 1999 four-door Oldsmobile Alero traveling on Paul Street, fired a 9 mm handgun at 5:16 p.m. from above the car roof. He allegedly aimed toward 20 to 30 young people outside the community center, some playing basketball. Gibbons said Ford\u2019s \u201ctargets,\u201d at least two people, were in the group.\nInstead, one of the bullets hit Romell, who was waiting for a ride to his city recreational league basketball practice, a sport numerous people have said he loved. No one else was injured. The vehicle fled the area and Romell was pronounced dead at 6:02 p.m. in the emergency department at OSF Saint Anthony\u2019s Hospital.\nGibbons said five other people were inside the car at time of the shooting, who have not been charged with an offense, although the investigation continues. \u201cThere may be other charges,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is still under investigation and other things still are being worked on.\nConnor repeatedly praised cooperation of the Major Case Squad and the Alton community for providing numerous tips to investigators that helped lead to Ford. \u201cA little bit of everything \u2014 tips, hard work and luck\u201d helped the Major Case Squad solve the crime within days, he said.\n\u201cI want to give kudos to the citizens,\u201d who kept the phones ringing at the police station with information, he stressed. The security cameras at Alton Acres also assisted in identifying the suspect\u2019s car, he said.\nWhen asked if social media, which reportedly spurred the dispute, also contributed to Ford\u2019s identification, Connor said: \u201cThat\u2019s a fair way of saying it.\u201d He also is chief deputy of the Madison County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible way to start the new year,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cThis is an absolutely heartbreaking tragedy. It leaves me saddened to have to start 2016 off with a young boy losing his life in such a senseless, violent way. I\u2019m also tremendously angry. This defendant\u2019s actions showed that he had a complete disregard for the life of this young boy and everyone else at the (community) center. He made the decision to try and resolve a dispute with a gun, and now my office is going to do everything they can to ensure a lengthy prison sentence to ensure that he will no longer be a threat to our community.\u201d\nGibbons also praised investigators. \u201cOnly through the hard work of rugged individuals\u201d did they solve the killing so quickly. \u201cThey have given everything. Our primary goal was to get the shooter charged and in custody.\u201d\nIf Ford is convicted of 1st degree murder, he would face up to 20-60 years in prison. Gibbons, though, said because a firearm was used, Ford is eligible for an additional 25-year sentence. A judge also could impose a life sentence. If convicted, he will have to serve 100 percent of his sentence, Gibbons said.\n\u201cThere is no easy answer to stop violence, to stop an individual from making such a choice,\u201d Gibbons said. \u201cThe community comes together \u2026 that is the most important take away from this, so we can have justice.\u201d He also praised Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Josh Jones and his office\u2019s Violence Crimes Unit for their part in solving the case.\nSimmons said Ford has a police record, but would not give specifics. Madison County court records show a misdemeanor charge for obstructing identification and an ordinance violation for graffiti.\nPeople still may drop off cash or check donations to help with Romell\u2019s funeral expenses at the Alton Housing Authority main office, 2406 Crawford St., during business hours; and (checks) in Harrison Funeral Home\u2019s drop box outside the office, 1924 Central Ave., both in Alton. Checks should be made out to: \u201cHarrison Funeral Home.\u201d\nThere also is an online, gofundme site soliciting money for the family\u2019s expenses.\nReach Linda N.
