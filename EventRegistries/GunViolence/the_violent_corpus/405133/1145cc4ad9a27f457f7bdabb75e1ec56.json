Based on witness interviews, closed circuit video and other evidence, investigators estimated more than 300 people were involved in the incident and at least four guns of different caliber were fired.\n\u201cJohn Tyler was playing Longview. That\u2019s where each gang is from,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe did get good information that they were going to do something there (at the game) and hopefully our presence there stopped that.\u201d\nThe people Smith named as people of interest played football either at the middle school, junior varsity or varsity level in Longview ISD.\n\u201cMany of these individuals we\u2019re looking for will wind up being suspects as far as being the shooters,\u201d Smith said.\nThey are:\nD\u2019Mio \u201cDuck\u201d Ingram, 24, Longview.\nDeKaylen Kaine Daniels, 20, Longview.\nLamond Demarcus \u201cTuTu\u201d Martin, 21, Longview.\nAaron \u201cFifty\u201d Blankenship, 21, Longview.\nTyson Dixon, 21, Tyler or Longview.\nLobos fans might recall Ingram, a running back who suffered a spinal cord injury during spring practice before his senior year in 2008. Though temporarily paralyzed and unable to breathe, the team captain later regained mobility.\nAt Tuesday\u2019s news conference, Smith said the confrontation began among a large group of people before midnight at the Flamingo Event Center on north FM 14 in Smith County. Private security personnel at the event center broke up the fight, he said, which is when the groups moved to Bunny\u2019s at Loop 323 and FM 14.\n\u201cThere began to be other altercations there, fist fights, which quickly escalated into shots being fired,\u201d Smith said.\nThe shootout resulted in the death of Laprida Shears, 25, of Tyler.\nThe videos, which were from cameras at various locations outside the store, show people running and taking cover as shots are fired. Some shooters can be seen. A video from inside the store includes audio. At least two volleys of rapid gunfire can be heard outside as patrons are seen reacting. Investigators said as many as 70 rounds could have been fired.\nSmith asked anyone involved or with knowledge of the shooting to come forward.\n\u201cWe assure you if you call in these individuals, we\u2019ll do everything we can to keep your anonymity,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any further retaliation in this investigation, which we have heard threats of retaliation, and we don\u2019t need that here in Smith County, Tyler or even in Longview. I think Longview\u2019s been hammered enough with homicides and shootings.\u201d\nAt Tuesday\u2019s news conference, the sheriff\u2019s office made available video and still images Smith said he hoped could help locate participants investigators want to question.\n\u201cJust imagine if your family would have been going to Bunny\u2019s that night, what they would have been hit with,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that get entrenched here in Smith County.\u201d\nSmith said investigators so far had executed 44 search warrants in Tyler and Longview, and interviewed as many as 90 people in Longview, Tyler and Jacksonville. He said he believed officers could make an arrest in the next few days.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact the Smith County Crime Stoppers at 903-597-CUFF, the sheriff\u2019s office at (903) 566-6600, or lead Detective Ron Rathburn at (903) 590-2686."}
