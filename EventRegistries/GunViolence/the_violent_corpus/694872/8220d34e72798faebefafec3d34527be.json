Wendell Raborn, the two men began shooting, wounding an 18-year-old man who was shot in the leg.\n\u201cWe received an anonymous call at 11:25 a.m. saying there had been shots fired,\u201d Raborn said. \u201cA second anonymous caller said someone had been hit.\u201d\nRaborn said Acadian Ambulance took the shooting victim to a local hospital, where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.\nThe IPSO spokesperson declined to release the victim\u2019s name because of the ongoing investigation into the shooting.\n\u201cAfter the shooting, the two men in hoodies ran away from the scene on foot,\u201d Raborn said.\nWhen asked about the close approach and relatively light injuries, Raborn said that, rather than having bad aim, some shooters purposely aim for the legs.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be charged with attempted murder if you hit them in the leg,\u201d Raborn said. \u201cWhen they are intent on staying out of jail, they will aim lower so if it goes to a district attorney, they can try to plea bargain down.\u201d\nThe shooting is the latest of several in the West End neighborhood. Aaron Francisco, 24, was killed on Oct. 27 on Field Street, within sight of Monday\u2019s shooting.\nRaborn said there was no known motive for Monday\u2019s shooting at this time. He also said the intersection of Hopkins and Lombard is a central location for known gangs in the area.\n\u201cYou have the Hill Gang, the guys on Anderson Street, the one over on Mississippi Street, then Ann Street,\u201d Raborn said, pointing in various directions as he rattled off the names. \u201cThis is a common area, along the border of their territories.\u201d\nInvestigators were questioning someone in the shooting, Raborn said, but they have no suspects at this time.\n\u201cThere was a lot of confusion, with some witnesses said the two men approached this way, and others saying they came that way,\u201d Raborn said."}
