As he was walking across the street to look for signs of deer activity the butt end of the rifle struck the pavement, causing it to fire.\nThe bullet passed through several fingers on Gilliam\u2019s right hand and his left forearm. He was taken to Maine Medical Center where he was listed in stable condition.\nThe 12-year-old boy was transported to Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor after accidentally shooting himself in the foot while hunting in Springfield on Thursday, according to Corporal John MacDonald of the Maine Warden Service in a news release.\nMacDonald identified the 12-year-old as Ashton Crowther of New Port Richey, Florida. He was hunting with his father when the boy inadvertently placed the rifle against his left foot and pulled the trigger. The wounds to the man and boy are not considered life threatening."}
