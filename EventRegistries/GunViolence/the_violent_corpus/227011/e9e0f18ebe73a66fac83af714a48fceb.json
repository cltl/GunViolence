LOUIS \u2022 A former city police officer who shot a robber at a south St. Louis bar in 2008 did it again late Tuesday night in a gunfight that wounded him and four others, and killed a woman.\nTwo of the wounded were trying to rob Pooh\u2019s Corner, police said. The other victims \u2014 including the former officer, 65 \u2014 were customers.\nOn Wednesday, Diana Lawrence, 63, of the 3400 block of Dunnica Avenue, who was shot in the back of her head, died after being removed from life support, authorities said.\nProsecutors charged Derreaun Davis, 20, of the 5700 block of Goodfellow Boulevard, and Corey R. Wade, 29, of the 4500 block of Davison Avenue, each with 32 counts of first-degree assault, first-degree robbery, attempted robbery and armed criminal action. Charges were expected to be upgraded to murder. A judge ordered them held without bail.\nDavis was in jail. Wade was in critical condition at a hospital.\nThe bar at 6023 Virginia Avenue in the city\u2019s Carondelet neighborhood has been a popular hangout for off-duty and retired police for more than two decades and has twice before been targeted by robbers who were met with gunfire.\nPolice said three gunmen entered the bar about 10:55 p.m. Tuesday \u2014 one of them shooting into the ceiling as they came in \u2014 and ordered everyone to the floor. Wade ran toward the former police officer and shot him in the thigh.\nThe ex-officer, who worked for the department for several years in the 1970s and has a concealed-carry permit, fired back, shooting Wade in the eye and Davis in the shoulder, police said.\nAnother male customer, 73, was shot in the ankle and was in critical condition; a fourth male victim, 66, was released from the hospital after receiving treatment for two shots to his buttocks.\nDavis and a third gunman, whose identity was unknown, fled in a stolen Mazda, investigators said. Police found the wounded Davis at a hospital; he claimed he had been shot at a different place. A manhunt continued for the third man.\nIn late November 1995, an off-duty St. Louis narcotics detective wrestled with a robber at Pooh\u2019s and was struck in the forehead with the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun. The detective then pulled a pistol from his jacket and fatally shot the robber, Anthony Bickell, 18.\nOn Sept. 15, 2008, the former officer in Tuesday night\u2019s shootout was working as a bartender at Pooh\u2019s when he stopped two would-be robbers. Those men, in their 20s, walked in about midnight and announced a holdup. The bartender, then 59, pulled a gun and fired, hitting one of the robbers twice in the buttocks. The wounded man was arrested; the other escaped.\nPooh\u2019s was open for business Wednesday, with a couple dozen regulars, many smoking cigarettes, drinking light beer, playing bartop video games or buying scratch-off lottery tickets. The front door has a \u201cNO FIREARMS ALLOWED\u201d sign, although customers know not everyone complies.\nOld friends shared hugs and tears. A buddy of one of the owners delivered several pizzas. Some expressed surprise that a known cop bar would become a target of robbers a third time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that it happened the first time,\u201d said Phil \u201cWard Cleaver\u201d Scharf, 65, of St. Louis, a retired accountant who has been the 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. bartender since the 1990s.\nThe bar opened in 1990 and is named after a former owner who went by \u201cPooh,\u201d as in the Disney character. Years ago, a customer turned the name into an acronym for \u201cPolice Officers Official Hiding Spot.\u201d The bar sells T-shirts with that slogan.\nRams and Mizzou memorabilia and flat-screen TVs adorn nearly every wall, but this is no sports bar. Cigarette smoke clouds the air. A sign reminds customers \u201cTHIS ISN\u2019T BURGER KING\u201d and that food is prepared any way the cook wants. Charity collection jugs include one for the BackStoppers, which supports families of fallen public servants.\nOne of Pooh\u2019s owners, who declined to be identified, said she doesn\u2019t think the robbers realized it\u2019s a cop hangout. More likely, she said, they see a corner bar near Interstate 55 as an opportunity.\nClosing the bar Wednesday was not an option, she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let them win,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re like Cheers here. Everybody knows each other.\u201d\nKim Bell and Christine Byers of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report."}
