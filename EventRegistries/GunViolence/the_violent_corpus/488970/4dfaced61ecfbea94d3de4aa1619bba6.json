They were the latest victims in a series of shootings in the city.\nThe police said they arrived at about 9:30 to find victims in the driveway and the back yard at 55 Curtis, a trail of blood up the driveway, shell casings and one live round on the sidewalk and an unhelpful crowd of 30 to 40 persons.\nThe others victims were Sombun Chet, 39, of 278 Manton Ave., Providence, who was shot in the back, and Oeun Sak, 26, shot in the left arm. All were taken to Rhode Island Hospital for treatment, in four ambulances, three from Providence and the other from North Providence.\nPolice from several units canvassed the crowd but said they found people \"generally uncooperative\" and unable to supply specific information about the shootings.\nThe trail of blood at 55 Curtis led up the driveway into the rear yard. The police said that it wasn't clear where the blood came from.\nOn Friday, meanwhile, a 16-year-old city youth was shot through the leg on Violet Street, police said. Responding to a report of shots fired at at Violet and Chalkstone Ave. they learned that someone had driven the victim to the hospital. He told the police that he was shot after a fight with a man he did not know, near the 7-Eleven on Smith Street. The police said the victim was uncooperative.\nThat followed the killing of 12-year-old Aynis Vargas, at the Hartford Park public housing project on the night of June 15. Three women were injured in the shooting."}
