He was treated at a local hospital and released and could return to work when he is cleared by a doctor next week, Chief Deputy Mark Karner said.\nThe deputy was bitten when the dog apparently broke free of a cage as police searched the residence. The deputy called for help and other officers opened fire, killing the animal.\nThe names of the deputies involved were not released.\nDetectives investigated the incident and in consultation with police commanders determined that the officers followed department policy in the use of their firearms, Karner said.\nThey were returned to work immediately.\nSignificant amounts of heroin, cocaine and marijuana were seized, along with $5,000 in cash, Karner said.\nThe investigation is ongoing, he said."}
