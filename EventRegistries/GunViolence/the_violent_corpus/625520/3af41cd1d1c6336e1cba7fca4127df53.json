She was later transferred to St. Christopher's Hospital for Children.\nDon Tucker, who lives on the block, said he was inside when he heard gunshots. He rushed outside to check on his 8-year-old daughter.\nThat's when the 51-year-old saw the 6-year-old victim motionless in a pool of blood.\n\"I just went down there to comfort her, keep her calm,\" until help arrived, Tucker said.\n\"She was conscious. She just said, 'Somebody shot me.' \"\nPolice arrived and took the girl and a distraught woman to the hospital, Tucker said.\nHis daughter was safe, but he was still shaken.\n\"It's not just about my daughter. It's about all the kids,\" he said.\nInvestigators found 21 shell casings from two firearms at the corner of Woodstock and Chelten Avenue, Small said.\nThe casings were grouped closely together, possibly indicating two guns were being fired in the same direction down Woodstock, Small said.\nPolice said Wednesday that investigators believed the shooter was firing at another unknown man who was running south on Woodstock Street.
