In the Labor Day shooting, police arrested Marion Daughton, who investigators said is a known gang member.\nDavis said one of the shooters came from an alley and two others came from up the street, shooting at a group of people.\n\"They emerged from three different directions, they planned it, it was premeditated,\" Davis said. \"One came from an alley two came from up the street and they shot at a group of people that were standing just over my left shoulder.\"\n\"That's premeditated. Those are the people who not only need to be in jail but underneath the jail, and we need to do the best we can to identify them,\" Davis said.\nPolice said the victims -- six men ranging in age from 26 to 39, a 36-year-old woman and a toddler -- are expected to survive their injuries. Among the victims is a 3-year-old girl and her father who were near the group of people.\nT.J. Smith, chief of media relations for the Baltimore Police Department, said at least a dozen shots were fired.\n\"This was an intended shooting at victims. The 3-year-old and the father were in a different location from the group, but these guys who committed this act really didn't care and they shot a 3-year-old girl,\" Smith said. \"These people wanted to be killers tonight but weren't successful in that.\"\nPolice believe three suspects are responsible for the shootings, one person armed with a shotgun and two people armed with handguns. Police believe the intended targets know who attempted to kill them.\n\"We have gotten anonymous tips in and we're very appreciative of that and we're hopeful that we'll get additional tips in,\" Smith said.\nAnyone with information is asked to call police at 410-396-2221, or Metro Crime Stoppers at 866-7LOCKUP, or text a tip to 443-902-4824."}
