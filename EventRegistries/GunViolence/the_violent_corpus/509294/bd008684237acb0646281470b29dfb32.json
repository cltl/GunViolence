Jonathan Howard, a Phoenix police spokesman.\nAccording to court documents, Chavez told officers he thought the gun was unloaded before pulling the trigger. The bullet hit his nephew in the chest.\nChavez is a prohibited possessor who is restricted from possessing a firearm, Howard said.\nHe admitted to officers that he bought the gun a week ago even though he knew he was not allowed to have one, according to court documents.\nPolice and paramedics responded to the call at a home in the 1700 block of West Tonto Street in Phoenix.\nAt last check, the boy's condition was improving, Howard said.\nChavez's bond was set at $50,000. His next court appearance was scheduled for Feb. 29."}
