You very seldom had anybody down there before then.\"\n\"I could see this coming,\u201d sheriff Chuck Smith said. \u201cI could see it happening.\"\nSmith says the Hill Haven Event Center, once known as Club CJ, has seen more than its share of trouble.\n\"There have been fights, incidents where people were seriously injured by stabbings, there has been damage to vehicles in the parking lot, and reports of shots fired,\" Smith said.\nAccording to Smith, there was gambling around a pool table that led to an argument.\nThe sheriff says the place is currently used to host parties with another coming up this weekend.\nThe county issued a permit to allow it but the sheriff says enough is enough.\n\"I have recommended to our county officials that they close this establishment,\" Smith said.\nSome neighbors think that would be very popular with most of the folks who live nearby.\nThe sheriff says all 10 shooting victims were treated and released from area hospitals.\nMeantime, the search is on for two trigger men."}
