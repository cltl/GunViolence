By Monday morning, all 10 had been released from their respective hospitals.\n\u201cInjuries sustained ranged from gunshot wounds to their arms, legs, feet, shoulder and one that was grazed in the head,\u201d Smith said.\nHe said investigators determined that, before the gunfire erupted, \u201can altercation occurred involving several subjects over illegal gambling that was taking place in the back portion of the building.\u201d Several people, none of whom have been identified or apprehended, pulled handguns and fired \u201cindiscriminate\u201d shots, Smith said.\nThe sheriff also said it was \u201cevident\u201d the bar \u2014 formerly known as Club CJ\u2019s Sports Bar & Grill \u2014 was not operating \u201cwithin the confines of its operational license,\u201d which prompted him to ask the Meriwether County government to shut it down.\nA sheriff\u2019s office spokesman declined to provide specifics on the alleged licensing violations. A woman who answered the phone at Hill Haven Event Center early Monday afternoon declined to comment but said a message would be passed along to the owner.\n\u201cNo community should be subject to this type of violence,\u201d Smith said, \u201cand my agency is going to [do] all that we can under the law to prevent this from occurring in this community again.\u201d\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the Meriwether County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 706-672-4489."}
