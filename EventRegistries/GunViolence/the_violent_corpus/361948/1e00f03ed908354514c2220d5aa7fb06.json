The other victims suffered from graze wounds and all are in stable condition.\nThree of the victims are children, according to police; a three-year-old and two ten-year-olds. The other four victims range in age from 24-46.\nNeighbors say the gunshots sounded like fireworks, but they did not suspect an assault like this had just taken place. Orlando Garcia lives on the block and called 9-1-1:\n\u201cI saw one of the guys I walk my dog every day he was in the ground bleeding real real bad.\u201d\nPolice say a shotgun was used by the gunman, who they say fled on foot. He is described as a black male, 5\u20197\u2033, between the ages of 25-30 years old, stocky built, wearing a red/white tank top, and a black handkerchief on his face. The weapon was recovered.\nInspector Michael McCarrick says the scene looks like the gunman was shooting at random:\n\u201c We don\u2019t have anything from a police stand point that we can say A led to B. The investigators are trying to find that out. We are hoping that we can get some community involvement here.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no word on a motive at this time as an investigation continues.\nThis is the second time in the last three days multiple people were shot in Philadelphia. On Saturday, ten people, including three children, were wounded when a gunman opened fire at a block party in the Mantua section.\n\u201cIt just makes absolutely no sense,\u201d says Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey.\nPolice are trying to determine if the two shootings are related, but say that does not appear to be the case at this time."}
