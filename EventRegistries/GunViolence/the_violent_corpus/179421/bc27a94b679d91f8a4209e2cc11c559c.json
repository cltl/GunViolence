Officers found no gunpowder residue on him, leading them to believe it may have been the recoil of the gun, not a bullet, that injured him.\nThe boy's mother was at home at the time of the shooting, along with another child.\nHis mother called 911, and her son was taken to Cooks Children\u2019s Medical Center in Fort Worth. The boy's injuries were not life-threatening.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s sad,\u201d said Gail Buerkle, a neighbor who also has children and guns in her home. \u201cI don't exactly know what happened. I\u2019m sure the parents got a good scare. I think they will think twice about where they store their guns.\"\nNo arrests have been made or charges filed in the shooting, officers told NBC 5.\nNBC 5's Holley Ford contributed to this story."}
