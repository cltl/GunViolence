She says not only is Sales raising two of her own kids, but also took on the added responsibility of another for a mom who needed help.\nFamily members say Sales was out school shopping when the shooting happened.\n\u201cSchool starts next week, she was out doing what she needed to do to take care of them,\u201d Sales\u2019 niece, Sherrise Brown said.\nPolice also found drug paraphernalia, pot and unmarked pills inside the home. But family members are adamant Sales do not use drugs and does not belong behind bars.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t belong in there and we\u2019re trying to get her out,\u201d Hunter said.\nPolice say the teen was unable to spell his name, give his mother\u2019s full name or her whereabouts but family members say he is Autistic, a developmental disability that can impact communication.\n\u201cHis actions shouldn\u2019t defy the mother that she is. She\u2019s a loving mother,\u201d Brown added.\nNow family members worry Sales will lose her public housing because of the charges against her.\nAs of Wednesday night, Sales is still behind bars on a $50,000 bond.\nA mother is facing a charge of aggravated child neglect after her 13-year-old mentally handicap son shot himself Tuesday with a .22 caliber handgun.\nShallon Sales, 36, remained in jail on a $50,000 bond Wednesday.\nThe child initially told Chattanooga police that an ice cream man shot him. The officer was suspicious of the story because the call was dispatched as gunman wearing a black ski mask.\nThe child eventually told the officer he accidentally shot himself. He told police he made up the story about the ice cream man because he didn't want anyone to get in trouble.\nAs officers spoke with the child, they realized the child could not spell his own name, did not know his mother's full name, phone number or where she was.\nSales later showed up at the residence distraught. She gave police consent to search her Hughes Avenue residence, according to an affidavit of complaint.\nPolice found a total of three handguns including a 9mm handgun and a .22 caliber gun which were loaded. One of the guns was stolen.\nSales also told police she was unaware that her boyfriend keeps a .22 caliber Lorcin gun inside the residence. Police noticed it was unloaded.\nThey also found drug paraphernalia, marijuana and unmarked pills. The items were in plain view, according to the report.\n\"Due to the presence of narcotics, paraphernalia, and loaded weapons in the house, coupled with the child's diminished mental state and lack of supervision and Ms. Sales' statement about unknown persons coming and going from her home, I believe there is probable cause to charge the defendant with aggravated child neglect, which led to the child's serious injury,\" an affidavit of complaint reads.\nSales is expected to appear before Hamilton County General Sessions Court Judge Gary Starnes on Aug. 20."}
