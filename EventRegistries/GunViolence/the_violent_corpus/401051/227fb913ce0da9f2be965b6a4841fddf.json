Hornsby K-8 School.\nParents rushed to the school just a around lunch time only knowing that there was a gun at school.\nOne big sister can breathe a sigh of relief after an unexpected day for Maequoia. \u201cWell, you need to go pick her up because they had a shooting. That\u2019s the only way I found out,\u201d Martika Jackson told WJBF News Channel 6.\nHer second grade sister told us she heard crying and saw people running out of classrooms. \u201cWe were taking a test. I was about to get up, but she said, \u2018stay down and put your head down\u2019, so I put my head down,\u201d Maequoia Reeves said.\nWe found out from the Richmond County School System\u2019s Communications director that a boy brought a gun to class against state and school policies. \u201cA student was playing with a weapon inside his desk. The weapon discharged and grazed a student in her side,\u201d Kaden Jacobs said.\nTasha Williams picked her child up from the middle school side of the building. \u201cI had to rush up here to get my son out of school. When I got here, the lady told me, \u2018you know it was at the elementary school?\u2019 I said, \u2018well ma\u2019am, I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry,\u201d Williams said.\nWhile some parents took precautions, others remained emotional until a Richmond County Board of Education Police Department ID check guaranteed them access to their kids.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a comfortable feeling. It\u2019s something we see on the news and we don\u2019t expect it to happen so close and then, when it is close, you don\u2019t know what to really think,\u201d Joe\u2019Micah Thurmond told us before he picked up his little brother. \u201cA lot of stuff goes on around here, but one bad apple makes the whole bunch look bad. So, it\u2019s not most of the kids. Every now and again, you get one that gets out of line and gets a little crazy. Whose ever weapon was found should have done better as to having it put up. Child should not have had access to it,\u201d he added.\nBut inside, kids were prepared. Cheyenne Ellison was one of them. \u201cI would have got in the cabinet and acted like I was a cleaning substance,\u201d she told us.\nIndia Ferrell was another one of them. \u201cIt was right around the corner from my classroom\u201d she said. \u201cHow did you feel inside?\u201d we asked India. \u201cI was scared. Yeah, I was scared,\u201d Ferrell replied.\nThat fear has parents planning what should be next\u2026\nShon Green said parents have a job to do. \u201cCheck the book bags and make sure your children aren\u2019t taking things to school,\u201d Green said.\n\u201cMaybe we can get metal detectors, or something like that. That would work,\u201d said Sonya Logan.\nThe 3rd grade girl who was grazed by the bullet is \u201cresting comfortably at home\u201d, according to Richmond County Schools\u2019 superintendent, Dr. Angela Pringle. The 3rd grade boy who brought the gun to school was taken into police custody.\nAll of the other students are safe.
