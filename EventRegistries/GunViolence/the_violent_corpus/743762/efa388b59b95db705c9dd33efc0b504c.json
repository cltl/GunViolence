The mother was not injured in the shooting, police said.\nThe toddler was rushed to a hospital and was listed in stable condition, said Officer Johnna Watson, a spokeswoman for the Oakland Police Department. No arrests were reported following the shooting, and a motive remained under investigation, she said.\nOutside UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland, where the girl was taken, Daryle Allums, a representative of Adamika Village, an Oakland antiviolence group, said he was acting as a spokesman for the family after speaking to her mother and praying for the \u201cpretty little princess.\u201d\nThe occupants of two other cars exchanged gunfire, and the girl and her mother\u2019s car got caught up in the crossfire, Allums said. Outside the hospital, Watson said police are investigating that possibility.\nWatson said investigators are probing whether the shooting is \u201cpossible retaliation\u201d to the slaying of a man Wednesday on Myrtle Street near 16th Street, the first homicide of the year in Oakland.\n\u201cWe are looking to see who the target was,\u201d Watson said, adding that Oakland\u2019s incoming police chief, Anne Kirkpatrick, has been briefed on the shooting. \u201cIt was a stray bullet that hit the little girl.\u201d\nThe child was in the backseat of the vehicle in a car seat when the shots rang out, Allums said, at least one bullet piercing the car and hitting her. The girl\u2019s \u201cwhole family,\u201d grandmother included, was waiting at the hospital for news of her condition, he said.\nWatson said members of the Police Department visited the girl\u2019s mother at the hospital to assure her they\u2019d provide every possible resource, emphasizing they were investigating \u201caggressively.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s fighting for her life right now,\u201d Allums said of the girl.\nAn elderly woman who lives in the East Oakland neighborhood and declined to give her name said she heard four distinct rounds of gunfire just before noon, followed by a pause, then another four gunshots.\nStanding with her 3-year-old son, Tao, not far from the blocked-off crime scene, Clare Stanley, who also lives nearby, described the shooting of the child as \u201cthe most kind of awful you can imagine.\u201d\nStanley said she also heard \u201cfour or five\u201d gunshots, and then a brief pause, followed by another four or so shots in quick succession. She was inside her home when the shots rang out, she said, and heard a car peeling away right after.\nBurbank Preschool is just one block away on 65th and Outlook avenues, Stanley noted, making the danger gun violence poses to children in the neighborhood all the more real. A representative for the preschool said the school briefly locked down after the shooting, but soon reopened.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a problem that it\u2019s hard to know what the answer is because so many people own guns around here.\u201d\nAnother man who lives nearby, David Dill, said he arrived home after the shooting to find a heavy police presence swirling around his typically \u201cquiet neighborhood.\u201d\nHe described the gun violence that all too often envelops parts of Oakland \u2014 including the 85 homicides recorded throughout the city in 2016 \u2014 as \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201ccrazy.\u201d\nAlready in 2017, Dill said, the shootings were hitting too close to his doorstep, \u201cin my neighborhood.\u201d\n\u201cMy heart goes out to her, you know,\u201d Dill said of the wounded child. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. It makes no sense. There\u2019s no reason for it.\u201d\nKimberly Veklerov, Sarah Ravani and Michael Bodley are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.
