He was taken to the Hamilton County Juvenile Detention Center for processing.\nMonday's arrest by Hamilton County Sheriff's Office deputies comes nearly two weeks after an initial arrest in the killings put 19-year-old Derek Morse behind bars on the same four charges.\nMorse and the 15-year-old are accused of killing John Lang, Caleb Boozer and Jon Morris outside Lang's RV on Kellys Ferry Place.\nA fourth victim, 16-year-old Michael Callen, survived to tell police there had been more than one shooter who emerged from the woods at dusk to ambush the four.\nThough police arrested Morse in the early hours of April 10 at a home off Elder Mountain Road, the search remained active for at least one more shooter. The news release announcing Monday's second arrest said the investigation is continuing.\nBrandon Jackson, brother-in-law and neighbor of Morris, told the Times Free Press after the shooting that he saw three shooters.\nA sketch released April 13 indicates an older man, more than 6 feet tall and weighing 220-230 pounds with a full beard, as a suspect in the case, but Sheriff Jim Hammond said Monday evening that he could not comment on the case.\nMorse is scheduled to appear May 8 for a preliminary hearing in Hamilton County General Sessions Court.\nContact staff writer David Cobb at dcobb@timesfreepress.com or 423-757-6731.\nPhoto by Dan Henry /Times Free Press."}
