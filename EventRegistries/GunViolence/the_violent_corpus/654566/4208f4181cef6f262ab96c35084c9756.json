Investigators have not determined how Leroy Roger Friedel, 41, died yet.\nAccording to the Bastrop sheriff, the investigator's \"working theory is that Leroy Friedel shot his wife, Jennifer Friedel, multiple times while outside the home following what appears to be a domestic disturbance.\" One of the shots that were fired entered the home and struck his son in the head.\nThe investigators' working theory is that Leroy then turned the gun on himself.\nThey were initially called to the home to perform a welfare check for a possible disturbance call. Authorities would not elaborate if they believe Leroy Friedel meant to shoot LJ, or was aware that he had shot him.\nAccording to the Bastrop Sheriff's Office, deputies went to a home on the 600 block of Oak Hill Cemetery Road in Bastrop around 1 p.m. Saturday. Once they were inside, they found the bodies in the home. They believe the incident also took place that day.\nAuthorities say they had no knowledge of past calls to that home, and added there were no signs of previous abuse. They do not believe drugs or alcohol played a role in the shooting.\nAutopsy results are still pending for Leroy Friedel pending further testing on the gun.\nThey believe a pistol was used in the shooting, and added other weapons were discovered inside the home.\nThis is an ongoing investigation.\n(\u00a9 2017 KVUE)"}
