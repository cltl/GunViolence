(WTNH) \u2014 Nine people were shot, one fatally, at a Bridgeport apartment complex on Trumbull Avenue early Thursday morning.\n\u201cThey were all just hanging out, having a good time talking to each other when all of a sudden, hell broke loose,\u201d said Bridgeport Police Captain A.J. Perez.\nPolice say 37-year-old Savonnie McNeil of Shelton, a father of four, was killed when at least two gunmen opened fire on a group of people in the Trumbull Gardens affordable housing complex parking lot around 1 a.m.\n\u201cThey waited for a while and then they said he was pronounced dead,\u201d said a woman who had a child with McNeil. She and their 18-year-old daughter went straight to the hospital when they heard about the shooting.\n\u201cShe was sad,\u201d said the woman said. \u201cShe loved her dad.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d she continued. \u201cCaring, loving.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you take my first born child?\u201d said McNeil\u2019s mother, Beilinda McNeil. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to anyone. He was a very gentle soul.\u201d\nThey say eight other victims, five men and three women ranging from 27- to 59-years old, were also shot. All of them were described as being in serious \u201cbut guarded\u201d condition earlier Thursday. Most needed surgery.\nOne of the victims, an elderly woman, wasn\u2019t out in the parking lot, but still was shot by a stray bullet.\n\u201c(She) was in her home taking a bath and the bullet went right through the wall and hit her in her back area,\u201d said Capt. Perez.\nShe\u2019s the only one expected to be released from the hospital Thursday.\n\u201cThis is the worst single act of violence in our city in recent memory,\u201d former Bridgeport mayor and current mayoral candidate Joseph P. Ganim said.\nPolice are still looking for the suspects in the act of violence, who were last seen running behind the complex.\n\u201cLiterally dozens of detectives are following leads, interviewing witnesses and visiting area businesses to determine if security video exists that will bring us closer to finding these gunmen,\u201d said Bridgeport Police Chief Joseph Gaudett said in a release. \u201cInvestigators are working non-stop and won\u2019t rest until we identify these gunmen and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\u201cWe have developed leads that we are pursuing, but we need the community\u2019s assistance,\u201d he added.\nAnyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Detective Ada Curet at (203) 581-5236.\nWinfrey will be teaming up with the brand, Kraft-Heintz to sell her own\u2026\nPlay Video\nPlay\nLoaded: 0%\nProgress: 0%\nRemaining Time -0:00\nThis is a modal window.\nForeground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque\nBackground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nWindow --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent\nFont Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400%\nText Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow\nFont Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps\nDefaults Done"}
