A handgun was recovered at the scene.\n\u201cAfter meeting with injured @LAPDSoutheast Officer, I'm in awe of courage displayed. Expected to make a full recovery and in good spirits,\u201d Police Chief Charlie Beck said on Twitter. \u201cInitial accounts in @LAPDSoutheast suggest that our brave #LAPD officers endured a fierce gun battle requiring unwavering courage.\u201d\nThe Los Angeles Police Department officer was taken to a hospital and released early Tuesday, spokeswoman Officer Norma Eisenman said.\nThe shooting occurred about 11 p.m. near 111th and Antwerp streets at the Nickerson Gardens public housing project, where police were conducting extra patrols, Eisenman said.\nAt the housing project, the officers saw a group of people who began dispersing and running away, she said. As police chased them, the suspect produced a handgun, Eisenman said.\n\u201cShots were exchanged between the suspect and officers,\u201d she said.\nDuring the gun battle, an officer was struck in the left arm and the suspect was struck by police gunfire, Eisenman said.\nBased on preliminary information, Beck said the gunman fired at least ten rounds.\nThe suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. The officer was taken to the hospital.\nKTLA reported that the suspect\u2019s mother, Lisa Simpson, said he was running across the street when he was shot and killed by police.\n\u201cThe police killed my son,\u201d the sobbing mother told the news station. \u201cHe was running across the street and they killed my son. They killed my son.\u201d\nAfter the gunfire, police swarmed the area and established a perimeter as they searched for other possible suspects. LAPD Sgt. James Linder said an \u201cagitated\u201d crowd initially gathered after the shooting, but the group dispersed.\nPolice were checking buildings and \u201cmethodically conducting a search,\u201d Linder said.\nThe incident comes as officers in Los Angeles \u2014 and throughout the country \u2014 are on high alert following the killing of officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, La., earlier this month.\nCiting his concerns over copycat violence, Beck last week announced he was taking extra precautions to better protect officers.\nImmediately after the shooting in Baton Rouge, the department deployed more police helicopters to fly and provide information to the officers on the ground. The department\u2019s entire Metropolitan Division \u2014 about 500 officers known for their elite training \u2014 was pulled off crime suppression detail to protect officers responding to calls.\nBeck sent a video to his officers about a week ago, saying he wanted to make sure that officers were \u201cas safe as we can be.\u201d \u201cWatch your back,\u201d he said. \u201cWatch each other.\u201d\nrichard.winton@latimes.com\nFor more Southern California news, follow us on Twitter: VeronicaRochaLA, @MattHjourno and @lacrimes\nALSO\nAt Nickerson Gardens, 'the wall' of names is sacred ground\nSix O.C. residents charged in a stabbing death over a love triangle\nDr. Dre is handcuffed and cited after a man claims he pointed a gun; deputies find no proof\nUPDATES:\n5:59 a.m.: This article was updated with details about the shooting, comments from Police Chief Charlie Beck and the man\u2019s mother.\n1:05 a.m.: This article was updated to say a suspect was dead and a gun recovered at the scene.\n12:40 a.m.: This article was updated with additional details on what led to the shooting and the condition of the officer.\nJuly 26, 12:05 a.m.: This article was updated with more details about the shooting.\n11:45 p.m.: This article was updated with comments from Deputy Chief Bill Scott.\nThis article was originally published at 11:15 p.m. on July 25."}
