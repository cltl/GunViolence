Three men went to the complex to continue an argument that had started earlier in the day at a separate location with another man. Afterward, the suspects, who were in two vehicles, pulled to the edge of the parking lot and fired back into a crowd that was standing outside.\nTymon Rayshun Sanders, 17, of Vivian, was visiting family at the apartment complex and was in the parking lot. He was hit in his thigh and was driven to North Caddo Memorial Hospital for treatment. Sanders, a junior at North Caddo High School, is the quarterback on the Rebels' football team and was recently named to the District 1-2A All-District team.\nPortia Ashley, 30, was getting into her vehicle when she was grazed by a bullet. She was treated at the scene by Caddo Fire District #8.\nAfter an investigation by the Caddo Sheriff's Office and Vivian Police Department, all three suspects turned themselves in. Darius Owens, 24, and Demetrius Owens, 23, both of Rodessa, were booked into the Caddo Correctional Center for two counts of attempted first-degree murder. Joshua Martin, 19, of Ida, was arrested for being a principal to attempted first-degree murder."}
