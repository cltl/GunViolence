Gen. Mark Milley, III Corps and Fort Hood commander, said Spc. Ivan Lopez, who killed three people and himself Wednesday, recently purchased the .45-caliber Smith & Wesson pistol at Guns Galore in Killeen. The gun was never registered with Fort Hood officials.\nWhen asked if he could confirm that Lopez purchased the weapon there, Richard Stultz, an employee at Guns Galore, said, \u201cI\u2019m not in the confirming business today, and we\u2019re not going to muddy the waters of the investigation.\u201d\nFBI spokeswoman Michelle Lee would not comment Thursday on where the weapon was purchased.\nGuns Galore is the same store where Hasan bought a gun and high-capacity magazines used to kill 12 soldiers and one civilian in 2009 at Fort Hood. Hasan is imprisoned in Fort Leavenworth, Kan., after receiving a death sentence in August.\nAnother former soldier, Naser Jason Abdo, in 2011 ventured to Guns Galore, where he purchased gunpowder and other items police said he planned to use in a pressure cooker he was trying to make into a bomb. He planned to detonate the bomb at a local restaurant packed with soldiers and shoot any survivors. Authorities were alerted after Abdo\u2019s purchase and he was arrested before carrying out an attack. Abdo is serving two life sentences plus 60 years at a penitentiary. He appealed in August to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans and claimed his arrest wasn\u2019t lawful, he\u2019d been denied access to an expert witness and was unfairly charged twice for the same offense. The court threw out his claims and upheld his sentence."}
