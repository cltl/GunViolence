A jury convicted him of second-degree murder and gang participation in February after a three-week trial before Judge Ronald W. Hansen. Hernandez was 17 at the time of the attack, but he was charged as an adult.\nThe Merced County District Attorney\u2019s Office said Hernandez intended to attack rival gang members but killed Moore, who was not involved in gangs, and injured three others. Hernandez fired at least 10 rounds from a Ruger P89 pistol with an extended magazine into a crowd of about a dozen people, according to trial testimony.\nAn appeal is planned.\nCo-defendant Christopher Aguayo pleaded guilty on Oct. 2, 2013, to being an accessory in the killing and was sentenced to seven years in the state Division of Juvenile Justice. Aguayo, 16, also was charged as an adult.\nProsecutors sought a first-degree murder conviction, but the jury found Hernandez innocent of that charge.\nDefense attorney Chris Loethen said jurors believed Hernandez shot into a crowd of people but did not intend to kill anyone. Loethen also noted the three other victims were all shot below the waist, which he said was further evidence Hernandez did not intend to kill.\nMoore\u2019s family rejected the argument and said the jury should have convicted Hernandez of first-degree murder.\n\u201cThe intent (to kill) was there,\u201d Brewer said outside the courtroom Friday. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a good marksman or not.\u201d\nIn his ruling Friday, the judge considered Hernandez\u2019s youth, maturity, and high school records when determining parole eligibility. Hansen said Hernandez\u2019s high school grades showed \u201csome hope,\u201d but were \u201cinconsistent\u201d and noted a history of suspensions.\n\u201cI cannot overlook the lifestyle he chose. I can\u2019t ignore the fact he killed an innocent person, a person he did not know, a person who did not know him,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cMr. Hernandez, you have a steep price to pay.\u201d\nHansen said Hernandez would not be eligible for his first parole hearing for 25 years, the maximum time allowed for a juvenile by law.\nLoethen said he respectfully disagreed with the characterization of Hernandez made by both the judge and the victim\u2019s mother. He said he empathized with Brewer\u2019s grief, but said the realities of the case were more complex than labeling his client as \u201ca monster.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a monster,\u201d Loethen said. \u201cHe was himself victimized (by gangs) and he tried to avoid killing anyone. That\u2019s not a monster. There are reasons why he ended up in that situation.\u201d\nHe described Hernandez as a \u201cshy kid,\u201d with a \u201cwarm, nice personality\u201d who got involved with street gangs for protection after he was assaulted by a gang member in San Jose. Loethen described Moore\u2019s death as \u201ca terrible tragedy\u201d for the victim\u2019s family, as well as Hernandez\u2019s family.\nDuring the trial, Loethen criticized tactics used by Los Banos police investigators during their interview with Hernandez. Loethen said police exploited Hernandez\u2019s youth and his ignorance of the law and crime scene investigation methods to convince him that he would never see his family again unless he confessed to killing Moore.\nProsecutors countered the argument saying detectives used legal, commonly practiced methods of interrogation in their interview and that falsely confessing to a murder \u201cmade no sense.\u201d"}
