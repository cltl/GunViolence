That victim was identified by authorities on Sunday as 40-year-old Dwayne Reid.\n\u201cThey found four individuals that were met by gunshot. At this point, it looks like one person has passed. The other three victims have been taken to area hospitals where they are being treated for their wounds,\u201d said Darryl Desousa, Baltimore Police Department.\nCollecting physical evidence is the easy part, determining what sparked the violence will take digging.\n\u201cWe have no indication what it may be about. We know the one victim that is deceased is not from this area,\u201d said Rich Worley, Northeast Commander, Baltimore City Police Dept.\nConnecting the four victims to each other, and then to a motive and possible suspects, is still complicated by more questions than answers:\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to fit the pieces to the puzzle together at this time. It\u2019s way too early for any descriptions of persons or vehicles,\u201d Desousa said.\nWhen police cleared the crime scene, one patrol car was left, just in case someone might know something. But Welbourne Road sat mostly deserted, and neighbors kept to themselves.\nThe identity and condition of the three victims\u2019 hospitalized remains unknown at this time.\nAlex DeMetrick has been a general assignment reporter with WJZ Eyewitness News since September 1984.
