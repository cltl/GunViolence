Corley lives at the home, police said.\nThe toddler was taken to WakeMed but later transferred to Duke Hospital, where he was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said.\nIn a 911 call released by authorities Saturday afternoon, a woman can be heard screaming as she tells dispatchers that the child shot himself.\n\"I heard a pop and ran upstairs and he was bleeding from the mouth,\" the woman said.\nAfter telling authorities that the child shot himself in the chin, the woman said the boy was starting to go to sleep.\n\"His eyes are getting weak. He's breathing and gurgling,\" she said.\nShortly after law enforcement officials arrived at the home, the caller said that the boy was awake and talking.\nDanny Royale lives in the neighborhood. He said the child was quickly rushed out of the home.\n\"The infant was only wearing diapers and they rushed out of here so fast. We didn't know what was happening,\" Royale said.\nIt was not immediately clear if Corley was related to the toddler. Corley was being held in the Wake County Detention Center.\nAn investigation of the incident is ongoing."}
