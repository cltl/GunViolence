Upon arriving, officers found a 16-year-old male and 15-year-old male, who had received an apparent \"grazing-type wound\" to the leg. Thomason says the victims told officers they had been approached by two armed males, one with a knife and the other with a gun, who demanded one of the victims' cell phone. Police say the phone was taken and shots were fired, resulting in the 15-year-old being injured.\nDanville police say the second incident happened in the 400 block of Robinson at about 8:45 p.m. According to Director Thomason, a 26-year-old man was sitting on his porch when he was approached by an individual, who demanded items. Thomason adds at some point, shots appeared to have been fired, and officers arrived on scene. Officers were soon dispatched to the 500 block of West Harrison, where they found a 17-year-old male who had sustained an apparent gunshot wound.\nAuthorities say an 18-year-old male in the area was also found, and taken into custody. The 17-year-old was taken to a local hospital for treatment, and was taken into custody upon release. Danville police believe both incidents to be connected at this time.\nThe investigation into these incidents are ongoing. We will provide more information as it becomes available."}
