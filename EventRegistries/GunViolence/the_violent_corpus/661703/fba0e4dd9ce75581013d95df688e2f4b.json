Mike Hawley of the Island County Sheriff's Office.\nThe suspect, who was not armed at the time of his arrest, said nothing, \"kind of zombie-like,\" Hawley said.\nCetin immigrated from Turkey and is a legal permanent resident of the United States, authorities said. It's unclear when he moved to the US.\nThe shooting stunned the small town as authorities warned residents to stay indoors and be on alert Friday night. The gunman vanished into the night along Interstate 5 after the attack, according to state patrol Sgt. Mark Francis\nFor much of Saturday, authorities searched the mall for evidence. A blurry surveillance photo of a rifle-toting man inside the mall offered a big lead in the hunt for the shooter.\n\"The city of Burlington has probably changed forever,\" Mayor Steve Sexton said. \"This is a senseless act. It was the world knocking on our doorstep, and it came to our little community here.\"\nCNN Map\nThe grainy security camera footage showed the suspect initially appearing to enter the mall unarmed and -- about 10 minutes later -- walking into Macy's carrying a rifle.\nThe suspect \"fired multiple times, struck four females ranging in age from a teenager to seniors,\" said Mount Vernon police Lt. Chris Cammock.\n\"I don't know what his motivation was,\" Cammock said. \"I don't know what his motivation was to continue, I don't know what his motivation was to stop, but I certainly intend to find out.\"\nHe said police recovered a rifle at the mall but would not disclose the type or caliber.\nThe FBI office in Seattle is helping with a review of intelligence. There's no information to suggest additional attacks were planned in the state, it tweeted.\n\"I didn't know anything,\" she said. \"The theater attendant came in and apologized for stopping the movie and said they were asked to have everyone leave immediately.\"\n\"But you immediately think about what happened in Aurora, Colorado, so you start moving faster,\" she said, referring to the 2012 shooting at a movie theater that left 12 dead.\nWhen they got outside, they saw police vehicles but no officers in sight, Montreuil said.\n\"We didn't know if it was a fire so we were looking for smoke of some kind. Then a few officers started canvassing through the crowds, asking if anybody saw anything.\"\nArmando Patino said he was working at a T-Mobile store near Macy's when he heard the commotion.\n\"Out of nowhere I just hear somebody yell and then after that, I turn around and just look at the Macy's and I just hear shots,\" Patino told CNN affiliate KOMO-TV in Seattle.\n\"I hear one shot and then stand kinda still and like two, three other people start running out saying, 'gun.' \"\n\"We went in the back where we have a door ... and we just stayed there until they told us to evacuate.\"\nOfficers using K-9 units searched the 434,000-square feet mall throughout the night, including in secure rooms, authorities said.\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee sent his condolences to the families of the victims and prayers to those injured.\nThe bodies were removed from the mall Saturday and are in the possession of the Skagit County Coroner's Office.\nThe coroner's office is identifying the victims and notifying their families before the names are released publicly.\nCNN's Sheena Jones, Shanna Pavlak, Joe Sutton, Salim Essaid, Dave Alsup and Steve Almasy contributed to this report."}
