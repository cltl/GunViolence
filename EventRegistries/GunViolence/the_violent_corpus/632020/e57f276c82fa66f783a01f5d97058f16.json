On his page, Rabior lists his occupation as \u201cPolice Officer at Detroit Police Department.\u201d\n\u201cJust prior to what should have been the end of my shift, I found myself lifting the nearly lifeless body of a seven year old boy from the back of our scout car and onto a stretcher for staff waiting on his arrival,\u201d Rabior said. \u201cMy partner expertly drove at ludicrous speeds to get him there while I gave his mother instructions on how to control the bleeding between giving updates to dispatch on our ETA and location.\u201d\nUnder Rabior\u2019s status, he posted a link to a story about the little boy, who was shot around 10:45 p.m. Tuesday on the 3600 block of Fairview.\nA man, identified by police as Torrey Craft, had argued with the boy\u2019s mother a day earlier, before returning to try and visit a child they have together. But the woman\u2019s brother blocked him and \u201cthe suspect attempted to shoot him and struck the child,\u201d Officer Nicole Kirkwood said.\nCraft turned himself in around 2 p.m. Wednesday at the department\u2019s 5th precinct.\n\u201cMy hands should have been busy tapping away at a keyboard, writing a report about the four guns we got off the street earlier in the shift,\u201d Rabior said of the hectic moments after the shooting. \u201cInstead my hands were covered past my elbows in the blood of a child.\u201d\nIt remained unclear if the victim is the child the suspect was attempting to visit, police said. He was outside with several other people when he was shot.\nThe gunman fled the scene following the shooting in a Chevrolet TrailBlazer. Prior to his surrender, police said an extensive search was underway.\nThe investigation is ongoing and police expect to submit a warrant packet to the Wayne County Prosecutor\u2019s Office for review, according to Officer Jennifer Moreno.\n\u201cI know a lot of people wonder why the hell I would ever want to work as a police officer in Detroit,\u201d Rabior said at the beginning of his post. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely crazy place to work. I\u2019ve been shot at. I\u2019ve been assaulted. Pretty good odds my nose has been broken once or twice.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen terrible things. I know the smell of gunfire, the smell of death, the smell of decomp. I\u2019ve had to listen to firsthand accounts, and see the results first hand, of how horrible people can be to one another.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been the focus of hatred directed towards me solely based on the uniform I chose to wear. I\u2019ve been threatened by gang members. I\u2019ve been promised shootings by people we\u2019ve caught on felonies that \u2018next time, we\u2019re gonna bang it out.\u2019 \u201d\nBut Rabior used Tuesday\u2019s night\u2019s rescue as proof his job is worth all that risk.\n\u201c(The boy) made it through surgery. He\u2019s listed critical due to his age and the amount of blood he lost. But he\u2019s alive,\u201d Rabior said. \u201cI don\u2019t know his name, but I\u2019ll never forget his face. He\u2019s why we do what we do.\u201d\nHFournier@detroitnews.com\n(313) 223-4616\n@HollyPFournier"}
