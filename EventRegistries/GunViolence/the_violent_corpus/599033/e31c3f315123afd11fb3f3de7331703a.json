The two were laughing and joking while leaving the store Friday night, he said.\nThe gunman, who remained at large Saturday, waited outside the store for the victims before opening fire and killing all three, the release states. One of the men died at the scene, while the other man and boy were taken to Loma Linda University Medical Center where they later died, Lt. Brian Harris said Friday.\n\u201cIt was a big gun, like a .45,\u201d Baji said of the silver handgun used in the slayings.\nBaji said that Travon Lamar Williams \u201calmost got away\u201d after the shooting began. According to Baji, the gunman shot the boy in the head first, then Mahan and ran after Travon Lamar Williams and shot him several times.\n\u201cI watched him die right before my eyes,\u201d Baji said of Travon Williams. \u201cIt was terrible.\u201d\nThroughout the shooting, there was no cry for help \u2014 or any words \u2014 from the victims or the shooter, Baji said.\nTravon Williams is the youngest homicide victim of 2016 and the deaths bring the total homicide deaths this year in San Bernardino to 38. Twelve-year-old Jason Spears who killed earlier this year near the corner of North Orange Street and East Love Lane was previously the youngest victim.\nAll of last year there were 44 homicides in the city, including the 14 people killed in the Dec. 2 attack.\nThe boy who was killed Friday night was initially reported as a 10-year-old by Chief Jarrod Burguan. It was determined that he was still 9 years old once a date of birth was given for Travon Williams, Sgt. Vicki Cervantes said Saturday.\nPolice believe that Mahan, a documented gang member and a recently paroled felon, may have been the intended target, according to the release.\nTravon Lamar Williams was not into gangs and worked to bring people together, said Aguadia Brown 27, of San Bernardino who attended San Gorgonio High School with him.\n1\n2\nNext Page"}
