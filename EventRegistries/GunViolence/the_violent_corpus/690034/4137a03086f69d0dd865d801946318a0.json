When they got to the house, police say they found Amos Rudd, 57, of Portsmouth, sitting on a couching. He was holding his chest, saying he had been shot.\nPolice say the homeowner told them he dropped a gun and when it hit the floor it discharged a bullet, hitting Rudd. Rudd was taken to the hospital where he died Sunday afternoon.\nAnother man who was in the house when the shooting happened told police he kicked the gun out of the way after the shooting. Police say they found it under a refrigerator.\nDetective Steve Timberlake with the Portsmouth Police Department told WSAZ what happened isn\u2019t a common scenario, but it isn\u2019t unlikely.\nTimberlake says the investigation is ongoing and an official statement on what happened won\u2019t be released until an autopsy is performed.\nNo arrests have been made."}
