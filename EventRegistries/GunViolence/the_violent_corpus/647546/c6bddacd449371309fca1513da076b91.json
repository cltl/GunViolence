This could have been your grandmother. These could have been your children,\" Baltimore police Detective Donny Moses said.\nAll three of the victims were taken to a hospital, where they are expected to be OK.\nWhat happened is still fresh on the minds of many, like Rochelle Smith, who got a call the Sunday morning from a family member in the area telling her what happened.\n\"I was like, 'Oh my goodness. What are they doing?'\" resident Rochelle Smith said.\n\"Whatever beef he had, he knew who he was shooting at. He just couldn't shoot, and we're fortunate that these people didn't suffer a more catastrophic injury,\" Moses said.\nThe shooting happened here at Latrobe Homes in the set of residences just behind me, and then the police believe the suspect took off running west.\nDetectives are now doing what they can to find the shooter. Police said the gunman is probably in his early teens and is from the Latrobe Homes area.\n\"They were knocking on doors, combing through grass as you guys saw, and from what I saw and from what I understand they've reviewed some video footage that was taken in the area,\" Moses said.\nFor some, it's a violent reminder of how quickly things can change.\n\"It's horrible and it's scary, but we just keep on living,\" Smith said. \"Regardless of what happens, we just got to keep caring about each other and keep checking on each other.\"\nAnyone with information is asked to call police at 410-396-2221 or Metro Crime Stoppers at 866-7-LOCKUP."}
