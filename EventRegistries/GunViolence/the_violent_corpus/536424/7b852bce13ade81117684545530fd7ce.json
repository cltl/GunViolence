(WWLP) \u2013 A 17 year-old pleaded not guilty to a second degree murder charge in connection with the shooting death of his 15 year-old girlfriend back in April.\nAnthony Diaz was held without the right to bail following his arraignment at Hampden Superior Court in Springfield Monday. A grand jury indicted Diaz for the murder of Daneyshkalis Davila, and also charged him with assault and battery with intent to murder.\nDavila\u2019s 13 year-old brother told investigators that he witnessed the shooting. He said Diaz was spinning the loaded chamber of a revolver when the cylinder snapped shut and the gun went off- striking Davila.\nDiaz ran away following the incident, but was later arrested on weapons charges, which were handled out of juvenile court.\nDiaz has no parents or legal guardian, so an attorney has been appointed as his guardian. He will turn 18 in August.\nThe next court date in the case is set for July 13."}
