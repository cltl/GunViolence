Officials said Harewood went inside the home, grabbed a gun and shot his 1-year-old daughter while she was sleeping. He then went outside to where his girlfriend -- the child\u2019s mother -- was sitting with family members and attempted to shoot her, officials said.\nWitnesses said the gun misfired, and Harewood turned the gun on himself.\n\"It's really devastating to the officers because a lot of the officers that responded to the scene tonight have children of the same age,\u201d Barrera said.\nNeighbors who knew Harewood are shocked, saying it\u2019s out of character for the 35-year-old father.\n\u201cThey (were) always out in the yard playing,\u201d neighbor Lawrence Turner said. \u201cHe just built a swing-set and she just started walking about a couple weeks ago. They seemed to be getting along pretty good but now you hear all kinds of stories.\"\nBarrera said the Harewood\u2019s girlfriend was struck on the side of the face during the incident. She was taken to Highland District Hospital for treatment. She has since been released.\nHarewood had a conceal carry permit and was an instructor for conceal carry permits, Barrera said.\nThe incident remains under investigation."}
