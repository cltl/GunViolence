The department later posted on social media that the women and children were all taken to the hospital.\nAlthough the Journal has heard reports from multiple sources that at least one child was killed, police wouldn\u2019t confirm that information.\n\u201cThere are children involved, there is an adult involved. However, the status is unknown at this time,\u201d Duran said.\nNeither Duran nor Police Chief Gorden Eden, who briefly answered questions outside the crime tape earlier in the night, would say what condition the victims are in, their ages or how they know each other.\n\u201cWe do not have a clear understanding of their relationships (to one another),\u201d Eden said. \u201cWe depend on UNMH to treat patients before we start asking them questions.\u201d\nHe said detectives were investigating to gather more information.\n\u201cWe have detectives currently at the hospital trying to interview victims as well as detectives that have arrived at the scene and are now interviewing people in the neighborhood,\u201d he said.\nEden wouldn\u2019t clarify whether the suspect had been shot, was dead or was in custody. He told reporters no suspects were at large. Officers were called to the area near Stagecoach and Sagebrush Trail SE around 6:30 p.m. Duran said more than one home on Stagecoach SE had been designated as a crime scene, but he didn\u2019t detail what happened where.\n\u201cThere are a couple of houses involved, and we\u2019re trying to figure out everything that is going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe field investigators are investigating the scene right now.\u201d\nMultiple ambulances could be seen leaving the scene around 7 p.m., and shortly after, rescue workers were seen rushing another person into an ambulance that sped away with its lights on. The mobile crime van arrived around 9 p.m. and marked units were posted, blocking the wide curvy streets for hours.\nThe incident appeared to have taken place at a two-story house with a three-car garage on Stagecoach Lane. A black SUV could be seen parked in the house\u2019s driveway with all of its doors open.\nOfficers and detectives were seen going in and out of the garage next door as well.\nPreston Rel, who lives in the area, said he heard several gunshots before police arrived.\n\u201cI heard between 15 to 25 gunshots,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounded like a high-powered rifle.\u201d\nHe said after he heard the shots, he turned on the police scanner and went to check on a friend who lives in the neighborhood.\nSeveral other neighbors milled about the streets and in front of houses decked out with Christmas lights. They asked questions and watched investigators going in and out of the crime scene Monday night, but many said they did not know the family that lives in the house."}
