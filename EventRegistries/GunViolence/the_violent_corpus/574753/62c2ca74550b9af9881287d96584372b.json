Burke High School. Today, officers located and arrested Jaden Waiters, 20, of Boston and charged him with Murder. Waiters is expected to be arraigned tomorrow (July 26, 2016) in Dorchester Municipal Court.\nAt about 1:16pm, on Wednesday, June 8, 2016, officers from District B-2 (Roxbury) responded to a call for a person or persons shot in the area of 46 Washington Street in Dorchester. On arrival, officers learned of four victims suffering from gunshot wounds. One of the victims, 17 year-old Raekwon Brown, a student at Burke High School, was pronounced deceased at the scene. Three other victims were transported to area hospitals where they were treated for non-life threatening injuries.\nSaid Commissioner William Evans: \u201cWhen a young man with his whole life ahead of him gets gunned down in broad daylight, finding those responsible is of the highest priority to the men and women of the Boston Police Department. Clearly, in the case of Raekwon Brown, those responsible cared little about who they hurt or what lives were ruined on that fateful day. To the Raekwon\u2019s family, again, I can only hope that the news of today\u2019s third arrest brings with it some small measure of comfort and solace. To my detectives, I want to commend them for the around-the-clock efforts that lead to today\u2019s arrest. Thanks to their perseverance and determination, the suspect arrested today is no longer in a position to hurt or harm in anyone else in our community.\u201d\nSaid District Attorney Dan Conley: \u201cMr. Brown\u2019s family, friends, and community can count on our best and strongest efforts to find justice on his behalf. But this is still an extremely active investigation, and we must strictly limit our public statements on the case. Our goal is not just an arrest, not just an indictment, but the best and strongest case we can build, based on the most reliable evidence we can put to a jury. So if you know something \u2013 if you know someone who knows something \u2013 the time to step forward is now.\u201d\nThe Boston Police Department continues to actively review the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident. Anyone with information is strongly urged to contact Boston Police Homicide Detectives at (617) 343-4470.\nCommunity members wishing to assist this investigation anonymously can do so by calling the CrimeStoppers Tip Line at 1 (800) 494-TIPS or by texting the word \u2018TIP\u2019 to CRIME (27463). The Boston Police Department will stringently guard and protect the identities of all those who wish to help this investigation in an anonymous manner."}
