Burrell\u2019s defense said hospital staff reported a general improvement in Burrell\u2019s state of mind during that time.\nBurrell\u2019s defense also called his sister, Sophia Johnson, to the stand. She said Burrell would have a support network of family ready to take him into their Florida home if Gauntt would grant Burrell probation.\nThe prosecution asked for a five-year prison sentence, but the defense asked for probation, calling the shooting accidental.\nAfter a short deliberation, Gauntt ordered Burell placed under 10 years of adjudicated probation and transferred his case to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he will be living with family.\nBurrell also must pay $550 in restitution and a $1,500 fine."}
