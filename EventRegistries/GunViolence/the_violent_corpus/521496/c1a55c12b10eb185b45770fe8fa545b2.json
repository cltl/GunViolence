The boy then went to his mom, Shannita Harrington, who called police.\nPolice spoke with the resident of the Caboose Court home who she and her family were having a backyard party and Easter Egg hunt. She reportedly told police she didn't see or hear anything unusual.\nMeanwhile, paramedics treated Ni-Shawn for his injuries and released him back to his mom. Later, Harrington took her son to Gwinnett Medical Center where doctors determined the wound was not from a bb gun but from a .22 caliber weapon. His injury was much more serious than paramedics initially thought and he was transported to Eggleston Children's Hospital in a helicopter in critical condition.\nPolice do not have a suspect and are looking for more information.\n\"We don't know if he was shot point blank. We don't know if he was targeted,\" Cpl. Michele Pihera of the Gwinnett Police Department said. She said the only description the victim was able to give is that the shooter was a man.\nDetectives are requesting that anyone with information contact police at 770-513-5300 or Crime Stoppers at 404-577-8477 to remain anonymous."}
