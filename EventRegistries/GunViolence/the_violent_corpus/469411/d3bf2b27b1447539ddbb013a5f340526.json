St. Louis County Police were looking for a teenager in connection with the tragedy. The 15-year-old turned himself in to police late Monday afternoon after a four hour search.\nSt. Louis County Police received a call about a shooting around 11:45am Monday. When they arrived at a house in the 1600 block of Emerald Creek Drive, they found that Xzavier 'Zae' Robinson, 3, had been shot. The toddler was rushed to St. Louis Children's Hospital where he was pronounced dead.\nInvestigators say there were several witnesses in the house at the time of the shooting. The child's father, Shawmane Robinson, did not want to talk on camera, but says he was asleep when his son was shot, allegedly by a 15-year-old boy who is family friend. Robinson says he did not hear any gunfire, and didn't know what happened, until relatives came into his bedroom and told him his son had been shot.\n\"The three-year-old boy was shot at least once, it appears in the abdomen. He was declared from the gunshot wound.\" said Officer Sean McGuire. \"It's tragic no matter when a life is taken, but to be three years old with Christmas this week. A lot of detectives, a lot of police officers, a lot of people in this neighborhood all have kids. So our biggest thing is trying to get this person into custody as soon as possible.\"\nPolice have not recovered the weapon used to kill the toddler. A family member says he doesn't believe the teen meant to shoot the child and believes it was a tragic accident."}
