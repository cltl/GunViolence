Like a swarm of bees, volunteers invaded the area clearing out blight and eliminating hiding places near Corning Avenue and Steele Street.\n\"It looks different. So if it looks different, it feels different. And if it feels different, it must be different,\" said one person who lives in the area.\nThe shootings of five men Wednesday night at the nearby Corning Village Apartments actually brought people together for this positive event quickly organized by the nonprofit LifeLine 2 Success.\nThe group's executive director, DeAndre Brown, told WMC Action News Five, \"It made me angry. Then it made me sad. Our children need to know our neighborhood is safe. They need to know adults will be adults and do the right thing and life is valuable\"\nThe Blight Patrol, which contracts with the city, provided services for free. The event ended with block party and cookout.\nMeanwhile, police have released no new information on what sparked the shooting that left five people injured.\nFour of the five victims have been released from the hospital, but one remains in critical condition.\nCopyright 2014 WMC Action News 5.
