I get a lot of relief from it but it still doesn\u2019t bring my son back.\u201d\nAccording to the probable cause filed against 15 members and associates of the \"Gett Money Gang,\" a trail of violence dating back to the shooting on the downtown canal on St. Patrick\u2019s Day of 2012 left death and mayhem for more than three years and led up to a fight on the midway at the Indiana State Fair last August 8.\nAn Indiana State Trooper was injured breaking up the brawl between GMG and KG, a gang from the south Butler/Tarkington community.\nGMG was headquartered several miles north in the 6400 block of Scenic Court and the Creekwood Apartments.\nOn August 26, Havvard was fatally wounded as he stood in the yard of a relative of Nicko Hutchins, a member of KG.\nOn September 9, Bryant Jackson was shot to death on Scenic Court.\nCourt documents indicate Jackson, \u201cwas considered a brother\u201d to GMG members Chuckie and Tarell Davis.\nThe next day, near 40th and Boulevard Place, \u201cA female\u2026was shot as she drove from her residence.\u201d\nInvestigators found \u201cthe .40 caliber casings matched casings from the (Havvard) homicide.\u201d\nTen days later, at the home of Hutchins in the 3900 block of Graceland Avenue, gunmen sprayed bullets at family members gathered for a wake after the passing of an elderly relative.\nDeshaun Swanson, 10, was killed as police searched the crime scene and found \u201ccasings matching casings recovered from aggravated assault\u2026on September 10.\u201d\nEarlier in the evening, a relative of the Davis brothers shot a video as he rolled down Graceland Avenue, past the Hutchins\u2019 house, while lyrics of background music warned of \u201cretaliation.\u201d\nThat video was posted on Facebook as a source told FOX59 News that within hours the relative called homicide detectives to claim that despite the warning, he had nothing to do with the killing on Graceland.\nThe murder of Deshaun galvanized the neighborhood, police and media as attention and investigators flooded the community but not before two more people were killed and eventually drug dealing and violence disappeared from the streets.\nPrayer vigils and peace marches became commonplace as residents began their own neighborhood patrol and made contact with neighbors from the northern side of the community.\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joe Hogsett walked the neighborhood weeks before his election as Indianpolis mayor last fall.\nOn November 13, Chuckie Davis, a purported leader of GMG, was identified as the shooter in an unsuccessful drug robbery on Lake Nora Drive.\n\u201cDavis\u2026fired a Glock handgun with an extended magazine,\u201d reads the GMG probable cause. \u201cShell casings\u2026match those recovered from\u2026homicide of Clarence Havvard.\u201d\nIn December, a weapon matching the description of Davis\u2019 gun showed up for sale on the Instagram account of gang member Daitwon Williams, the accused triggerman of the unsolved canal shootings in 2012.\nMore shootings followed on Scenic Court but throughout the investigations, detectives reported, \u201cAll involved refused any further cooperation and nobody has been charged.\u201d\nIn December a federal judge signed off on wiretaps of gang member cell phones to record conversations. That evidence matched with tapes of phone calls from inside the Marion County Jail, along with social media postings, police reports and surveillance videos that led to the gang conspiracy, drugs and weapons charges against GMG.\nClarence Havvard admitted it was frustrating to wait eight months for answers to the murder of Wade.\n\u201cI guess I was a little rushy just trying to make sure we find the killer of my son and the little guy, 10-year-old Deshaun,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just praying on it and eventually things start clearing up and coming to the light.\u201d\nAs tragic as his loss, Havvard is grateful his neighborhood stood up to the violence and banded together to welcome police and outsiders in to help bring the suspects to justice even though they may never be charged with his son\u2019s death.\n\u201cI feel more confident that it will be bringing a lot of peace to the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cThe community will be more safer because of the people who will not be out here doing all this shooting and so forth.\u201d"}
