They used to play soccer right in front of my apartment every night. I can't imagine how it's going to be for the other kids when they find out.\"\nClearwater police are still investigating how the gun was stored and why they boy was able to access it so easily.\nThe chief says the tragedy is a stark reminder to gun owners to keep their weapons out of reach to children\n\"There are rules and restrictions on making sure you keep a gun in a safe manner that's not accessible to a child, and I think that's just the responsible thing to do as a gun owner,\" Slaughter stated. \"I'm not here to debate the Second Amendment or anything, but with certain rights in the Constitution come great, great responsibility. And if a person owns a firearm, there is a responsibility to keep it in a safe location.\"\nThe boy's mother, 49-year-old Olga Grusetskaja, was the only other people home at the time of the incident."}
