One, 33, was shot in the neck and the other, 25, suffered gunshot wounds to the arm, side and back. A 45-year-old woman shot in the arm was taken to Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park, along with a 54-year-old woman with wounds to the leg and foot, police said. They were in fair-to-serious condition, according to the Chicago Fire Department.\nForeman\u2019s family members gathered outside Holy Cross early Friday morning as they learned the news of her death. Some cried and others were dazed and said they couldn\u2019t believe what they were being told.\nForeman was inside her car with another woman when two groups of people opened fire on each other from either end of the block and they both were shot, her mother, Cathy Geralds said. The three others were shot on the front porch of Foreman\u2019s aunt\u2019s home, Geralds said.\nGeralds heard about the shooting from her cousin, whose wife was among the victims, Geralds said. When she arrived at the crime scene, she was told she didn\u2019t want to see her daughter in the condition she was in.\n\u201cAnd I knew she was gone,\u201d Geralds said. \u201cShe was gone.\u201d\nGeralds remembered her daughter as a responsible woman who had worked at her job for 10 years. Foreman\u2019s 6-year-old daughter will likely live with her now. Geralds said her daughter had been shot in a previous incident near 79th Street and King Drive.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get to talk to her today,\u201d Geralds said. \u201cI sent her a text and wished her a happy birthday.\u201d\nOne of her cousins, who asked not to be named, said she was with Foreman earlier in the day.\n\u201cShe was a great person,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were just saying earlier, we were afraid of these streets.\u201d"}
