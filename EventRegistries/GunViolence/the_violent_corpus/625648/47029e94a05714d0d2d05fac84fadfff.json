(KOIN) \u2013 Jeffrey Giddings, the man accused of trying to kill 2 law enforcement officers and taking a woman hostage at a Gladstone Subway, was officially charged with 6 major crimes on Wednesday.\nProsecutors in Clackamas County charged the 45-year-old Giddings with 2 counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count each of first-degree kidnapping, unlawful use of a weapon, first-degree criminal mischief and being a felon in possession of a firearm.\nOn Monday, the Gladstone Police Department confirmed Giddings shot Sgt. Lee Jundt after an attempted traffic stop. One of the attempted aggravated murder charges is for that specific shooting.\nNew court documents filed Wednesday revealed Giddings also attempted to kill Clackamas County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Benjamin Frazier.\nIt remains unknown if Giddings fired multiple times while fleeing into a Subway restaurant where he took a woman hostage and kept law enforcement at bay for more than an hour.\nCourt documents also say Giddings used the woman \u201cas a shield or hostage\u201d and that he caused damage to a patrol vehicle, telephones, and other property of Subway, the Gladstone Police Department and the hostage\u2019s.\nThe federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 confirmed Giddings had absconded from a regional facility that helps transition inmates back into society following the incarceration.
