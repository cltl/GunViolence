Chief Puckett said witnesses were present but no one else was participating in the game. The gun did not belong to the victim but he was in possession of it. Puckett said it is not illegal for an 18-year-old to have possession of a gun but must be 21 to purchase and register a handgun. Puckett said there is no suspicion of a crime involving the handgun.\nThe victim\u2019s body was transported to the western lab of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Roanoke for autopsy. Asst. Chief Puckett said there was no information available on the presence of drugs or alcohol, but blood tests would be done as part of the autopsy. The investigation is continuing.\nThe Saltville Police Department was assisted by the Chilhowie Police Department, Smyth County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Virginia State Police. The Saltville Rescue Squad also responded."}
