While he was playing with it, he accidentally shot himself in the head.\nHe was pronounced dead at the scene after an EMS crew arrived.\nFlint Police Chief James Tolbert told ABC12 News the homeowners may not have known the gun was in their home.\n\"It's uncalled for. It shouldn't of happened and some simple common sense could of prevented this,\" Tolbert said.\nNow the question remains - will anyone face charges in this child's death?\nWe talked with Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton about the case. He said it's still under investigation, and went on to say, \"No matter how the facts turn out, I implore our citizens to keep weapons out of the reach of children. To not do so can result in this kind of tragedy.\"\nTolbert says his investigators are working to figure out who the gun belongs to and how it got there."}
