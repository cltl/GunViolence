The teen, who sources said is about 16 years old, lived in the neighborhood.\nHe refused to drop the butcher knife, and began banging it against a shed behind the house, Monterey County Deputy District Attorney Ed Hazel said. Two people were inside the shed.\nPolice called in the Salinas Fire Department to use a fire hose as a tactic to subdue the \"irrational\" boy, Hazel said.\n\"They brought in the fire hose to try and knock him down,\" he said.\nThree officers deployed Tasers and non-lethal rounds.\nThe fire hose, Tasers, and non-lethal rounds were all ineffective in disarming the boy, Hazel said.\nWhen the boy walked inside a house, officers decided to follow him because they were concerned that the teen may make people inside hostages, Hazel said.\nOnce inside the house, the boy turned toward the officers; he was still wielding his knife, Hazel said.\nOne officer shot the boy six times with an AR-15 rifle, while a second officer shot the boy twice with a handgun.\nTwo people came out of the backyard shed following the officer-involved shooting. The shed had been converted into a makeshift bedroom.\nA total of 14 officers were deployed for the incident, and most, if not all, of the officers had their body cameras activated. The Monterey County District Attorney's Office is investigating to determine if officers committed a crime, and Hazel said the body camera footage is a \"big part\" of the investigation.\nTwo officers were placed on administrative leave. Police have not released the teen's name or age, but Hazel said the boy is less than 18 years old.\nSalinas' new police chief, Adele Frese, declined to comment to KSBW about whether she would release names of officers involved in the shooting.\n\"The Police Department will not be commenting on the case in order to protect the integrity of the investigation,\" Frese wrote on the SPD's website.\nA coroner will perform an autopsy on the boy Thursday, and toxicology tests will take weeks to complete."}
