She remained friends with Lee, who was known as Arie Edward in school, the rest of Lee\u2019s life.\nByerly last talked to Lee, 37, on May 25, less than two weeks before Lee and her three children were shot dead by Michael Augustine \u201cAugust\u201d Bournes, 59, her companion and the kids\u2019 father.\nBournes then set fire to their southwestern Montana log cabin, laid down next to the children\u2019s bodies and shot himself with a .45-caliber pistol.\nFriends say there were signs of trouble with Bournes, who had recently had an argument with the closest thing to neighbors in the remote wilderness area they lived in.\n\u201cAt the end, you could only talk to her for a little bit before she would have to go,\u201d said Byerly, who has lived off-and-on in the Tri-Cities for years.\nThat was a change from the woman her friends knew.\n\u201cShe exuded confidence, was strong, spoke her mind and had a great sense of humor,\u201d Byerly said. \u201cShe was also kind, loyal, smart and the most loving person I\u2019ve ever met. She was and always will be a beautiful soul.\u201d\nLee was born in Spokane and moved to the Tri-Cities at a young age, said her brother, Phil High-Edward.\nTashia Flieger of Pasco took her children to visit Lee and her family at their Montana cabin in 2013, when they were in the area for her son\u2019s baseball tournament. Her son helped Bournes get firewood for the long winter, while she watched Lee cook on a propane stove.\n\u201cEverything she did was homemade,\u201d Flieger said. \u201cI must have a million pictures on my phone of something she would bake.\u201d\nFlieger and Lee last saw each other a year later, when Lee visited them in Kalispel when Flieger returned for another tournament. Flieger cried for hours after they said goodbye, only to talk to Lee and learn that she did the same.\nAfter Lee\u2019s youngest child, Arie, who was 1 when she was killed, was born, Flieger noticed a change.\n\u201cI sent her a picture of the kids back in November and it took her a week to respond,\u201d she said. \u201cShe said she was too busy.\u201d\nFlieger feels bad because she did not try harder to find out what was going on with her friend.\n\u201cI let her phase out,\u201d she said. \u201cArie was not the kind of person who would share if she was going through hard times.\u201d\nLee hadn\u2019t lived in the Tri-Cities since graduating from Kamiakin in 1995, but her friends continued to keep up with her. They have scheduled a celebration of life service at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at Calvary Chapel Tri-Cities, 10611 W. Clearwater Ave. in Kennewick.\n\u201cThere is an outpouring of people here who knew her and loved her,\u201d Flieger said. \u201cShe was a huge part of the community, and her mother was a huge part of the community.\u201d\nHigh-Edward, who lives in Spokane, will return to the Tri-Cities for the event.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a perfect time to come together and remember Arie for the very sweet, nice, kind person she was,\u201d he said."}
