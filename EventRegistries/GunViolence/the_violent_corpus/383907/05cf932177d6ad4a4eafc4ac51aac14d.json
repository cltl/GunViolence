The girl was transported to a hospital.\nPolice Cmdr. Robert Alder said the victim was found shot inside the housing complex.\nTwo police sources said early Thursday that the girl was apparently shot by a 7-year-old boy who had found a gun in the apartment. The two sources said they think the weapon was fired twice, but they were not sure where it came from.\nDozens of police were in the area, and they initially said they were looking for a black male with dreadlocks. That person was believed to be wearing a green hat and a blue T-shirt. But as of about 10:30 p.m., police said they did not have a lookout for a suspect.\n\u201cAt this time, we don\u2019t have any lookouts to provide,\u201d Cmdr. Robert Alder said at a news conference.\nThe shooting happened about 8:18 p.m. at the Benning Terrace housing complex in the 600 block of 46th Place SE, near Benning Road SE.
