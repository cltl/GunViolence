On May 3, 2011, the bodies of teens Fernando Felix Solano, 16, and Sandra Salgado, 14, were found shot to death near the park.\nToday, the Oceanside community continues rebuild after the tragic violence, promoting a better life for youth through mentoring programs such as the Vista Community Clinic\u2019s Project REACH.\nOn Friday, two years to the date of the deadly shooting, the City of Oceanside and Project REACH hosted THE 2nd annual \u201cCelebration of Life\u201d event at the park, bringing residents together to remember those who died and encourage the bright futures of teens who still live in the area.\nNowadays Libby Lake Park is starkly different from the one people feared just two years ago. Instead of darkness hanging over the park, there is hope.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the peacekeepers here \u2013 we really are,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cWe can strive for more.\u201d\nGarcia was shot six times that fateful night \u2013 twice in the head. He said the shooting not only changed his life, but his community.\nNow a student at Mira Costa College, Garcia said the shooting made him realize that making his community a safer and better place is possible.\nProject REACH helped him and now, in turn, he helps mentor youth through the program.\nJimmy Figueroa with Project REACH said the program and events like Friday\u2019s celebration are living proof of the change that has transpired in the community.\n\u201cYou live in this community where, yes, tragedy has happened, but you\u2019re saying, \u2018That might have been the past but it\u2019s not going to be my reality. It\u2019s not my expectations that I have for my community and myself,\u2019\u201d he explained.\nOver the past couple of years, Figueroa said he\u2019s seen local youth go from being sad and frustrated to channeling their emotions into creating positive change through the common goal of inspiring and influencing younger generations.\nNow, Libby Lake Park is packed with kids and teens playing instead of living in fear.\n\u201cIt\u2019s their park now, and they\u2019re enjoying it,\u201d said Figueroa.\nMany teens like Garcia have rallied together through the Project REACH after-school program. They've done Public Service Announcements aimed at keeping teens away from drugs and violence.\nOceanside Police Department Lt. Leonard Cosby said the youth should be extremely proud of the work they\u2019re doing and the difference they are making in the area.\n\u201cOur crime rate this year is down over 9 percent and our gang-related crime rate is down over 30 percent,\u201d said Lt. Cosby. \u201cFor the community, it\u2019s a great thing.\u201d\nSo, on a day that could\u2019ve been full of grief, the community and Garcia chose to focus on just how far they've come and what lies ahead in the future \u2013 a future Garcia is so grateful to have.\n\u201cI want for my future to be successful. Every day that you live you have to do something new, otherwise you\u2019re not living,\u201d he said.\nEventually, Garcia plans to transfer from Mira Costa College to UC Los Angeles, UC Berkeley or Pepperdine University. He said he wants to become a lawyer so he can help people in his community."}
