He later died at the hospital. Police say he was a juvenile.\nTwo others were also transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\nPolice are not identifying the victims but a resident in the area, Ricky Aiken, who just recently founded the Inner City Innovators program, says the man who died on scene was his 18-year-old friend.\nHe says the four men were walking down the road when a car pulled up, whipped out a weapon that looked like an assault rifle, and fired several rounds.\n\"People are doing the best they can,\" he said. \"You know, people are here for a reason. If everyone could get up and leave to a safer environment they would, but they can't. This is life for us. This is life for them.\"\nAiken is urging the community to come together and use this as fuel for change.\nPolice say they do not have a suspect in custody at this time and they are still working to find a motive."}
