Police say store surveillance video of the Friday shooting shows Sunna wasn't endangered by the slain boy, Fabriccio Patti, or two other teens, ages 14 and 15.\nProsecutor Frank Coumou says Patti was shot in the back.\nIn separate comments, Gentile and Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson called the case a tragedy for the families involved."}
