The friend said that she immediately took the baby to the hospital. The friend told officers that she did not hear a gunshot.\nThe 17-year-old said that he was outside of the apartment on the porch when he heard a loud pop. He said he entered the apartment and saw the baby sitting on the floor in front of a couch bleeding.\nThe teen said that he saw a small caliber handgun in the hands of a 3-year-old, who is the brother of the 13-month-old.\nThe teen said he did not remember who took the handgun from the 3-year-old or where the handgun came from.\nDavis said she did not have a handgun in the apartment.\nDetectives determined that 17-year-old was outside with possibly three friends when the shooting happened.\nThe detectives were unable to recover the handgun as it had been moved and no one has any knowledge of what happened to it.\nThere are several inconsistencies in the statements that detectives obtained from witnesses at the scene, authorities said.\nThe 13-month-old is in the custody of the Department of Children and Families, along with her 3-year-old brother.\nNo criminal charges have been filed.\nThe circumstances surrounding the shooting are suspicious and the investigation is ongoing, police said.\nAnyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-226-8477.
