The victim, Saul Bermudez, 17, said thought he had been struck by a firework.\n\"I had my back to my friend and I thought he shot me with a Roman candle,\" said Bermudez.\nIt turns out, he had been shot.\n\"My little brother touched, like, the bullet,\" Saul said. \"He said that I had gotten shot and I didn't believe him until I touched it for myself.\"\nDoctors said the bullet struck the victim at a downward angle and appeared to have resulted from a bullet returning to the ground from celebratory gunfire.\n\"They laid him down and he had blood coming out and so he had been shot and actually it was not a firework,\" Saul's grandmother, Noemi Meji, said through an interpreter.\nSaul was treated at a hospital and released. Everyone said they know how fortunate they are.\nPeople living in the neighborhood said they heard gunfire in the area along with the sounds of people shooting firecrackers.\n\"We knew it was a gunshot because it has that pow-pow-pow-pow-pow sound, versus the fireworks,\" said neighbor Jeanette Woods. \"It just has a different sound. If you're used to doing fireworks, you know the difference.\"\nJimmilia Johnson, a mother who lives in the area, said she's disturbed by the shooting.\n\"You don't want it to happen to anyone's child, but I have three and my sister has two and my nieces were outside and it's just, like, so close, you know? And it could be anybody,\" she said.\nShe said her son was injured by a wayward rocket last year. After this year's gunfire, she said the family gave up and went inside.\nPolice said they're working to find out which gun fired the bullet.\nFive years ago, Blair Shanahan Lane, 11, was struck by celebratory gunfire while attending a Fourth of July event with her family. Lane's family and police visited areas last week where gunfire is common to caution people not to celebrate by shooting guns into the air.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Crime Stoppers TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477."}
