They were taken to the Ryder Trauma Center where they were pronounced dead.\nPolice have identified them as 18-year old Tiarra Ashonda Grant and 22-year old Shalaunda Williams. Grant left behind a 1-month old baby.\nA 23-year old with multiple gunshot wounds to the leg was also taken to the Ryder Trauma Center.\nThe fourth woman, who was shot in the arm, was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital.\nPolice have withheld the names of the two survivors.\n\u201cI just think that it\u2019s crazy because it\u2019s women and stuff, like it\u2019s crazy, the community is crazy, they killing women it don\u2019t matter,\u201d said China Black who lives in the area.\nNeighbors with children said they are on edge about the whole situation.\n\u201cAs a father this is one reason why I keep my children inside. I don\u2019t allow them to come out and play because a lot of times some of these things just pop off unexpectedly, in broad daylight. There\u2019s no time for violence. When it happens it happens,\u201d said Al Barley.\nAnyone with information on the shooting is urged to call Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS."}
