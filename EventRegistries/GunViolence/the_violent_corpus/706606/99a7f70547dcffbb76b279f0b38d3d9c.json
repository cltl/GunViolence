The bullet went through the home and struck the teen girl in the leg, who was sitting in the kitchen.\nThe girl was taken to the hospital where she is currently in stable condition. No arrests have been made.\nPolice say there was also a double shooting nearby hours earlier. They are investigating whether the two shootings are related.\n\"She's still very fortunate that she was only hit in the leg and she's in stable condition because the spent shell casings we found in ballistic evidence are .45 caliber which are very large,\" said Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Scott Small.\nIf you have any information on the shooting, please call Philadelphia Police."}
