Riccardi-O'Connor and Atherton - childhood friends - began passing a gun back-and-forth and pointing it at each other.\n\"It appears the fatal shooting may have been an unintended consequence of this behavior,\" Ryan and Stoneham Police Chief James McIntyre said in a statement.\nPolice said Riccardi-O'Connor originally told them Atherton had shot himself but later admitted shooting Atherton while the two were \"fooling around with the gun.\" Riccardi-O'Connor told police he didn't think the gun was loaded.\nRiccardi-O'Connor's attorney didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.\nAtherton received a single gunshot wound to the chest. The gun was registered to Riccardi-O'Brien. Both men were military police officers in the Massachusetts Army National Guard.\nJudge Michael Brooks set bail at $25,000 cash.
