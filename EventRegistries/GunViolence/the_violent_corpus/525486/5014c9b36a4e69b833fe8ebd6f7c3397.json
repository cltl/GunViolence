He was taken to University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children\u2019s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 4:36 p.m.\nDevon\u2019s brother brought the .22-caliber gun into the house, although investigators are still trying to determine how he got the gun in the first place, according to Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.\nAn autopsy Monday did not rule on Devon\u2019s cause or manner of death, with final results pending further investigation, according to the Cook County medical examiner\u2019s office.\nRELATED:\nTears and pain at vigil for 7-year-old Englewood boy\nClaudia Harris, a next-door neighbor and close friend of the family, said she was in her home when one of Devon\u2019s brothers ran in and yelled for her to call police.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on at first, but I knew it was bad,\u201d Harris said. Devon, a first-grader, lived in the home along with his mother, grandmother and several siblings, Harris said.\nBernard Warfield, another next-door neighbor to the south, said he saw Devon and greeted him when the boy rolled up to his home on his red bicycle just a few hours before the shooting.\n\u201cHe said \u2018See you later,\u2019 the last words. . . . It\u2019s traumatizing,\u201d Warfield said, who recalled seeing the boy outside playing football on the block regularly.\n\u201cHe was a great kid. It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Warfield said.\nHolmes said he had spoken with some of Devon\u2019s family members, including the boy\u2019s mother, who was taken to a hospital after going into shock.\nAccording to the preliminary investigation, Holmes said Devon and at least one other child were playing with a gun, which they might have mistaken for a toy.\nHolmes said Devon accidentally shot himself in the chest, though police have said he suffered a head wound. Investigators were performing gunshot residue tests on the boy\u2019s hands to confirm it was self-inflicted, Holmes said.\nThe boy\u2019s grandmother was home at the time, Holmes said. Investigators are trying to figure out whose gun it was.\n\u201cNo matter if they thought that was a BB gun or a toy, that weapon should not have been inside that home,\u201d Holmes said."}
