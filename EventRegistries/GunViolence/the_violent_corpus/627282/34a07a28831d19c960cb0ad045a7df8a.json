The wreck caused an officer to accidentally shoot himself.\nAntwon Baldwin, 19, is facing 10 charges including assault on a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest, receiving stolen property and tampering with a motor vehicle.\nTyrone Hendrix. 21, is charged with tampering with a motor vehicle.\nPolice believe the two allegedly broke into homes and took keys in order to steal cars.

Hendrix was arrested as he walked out, while Baldwin got into a stolen Mazda and hit two other cars that were blocking him in.\nAn officer outside the home pointed a gun at him but didn\u2019t shoot, police say.\nBaldwin then got away and led officers on a chase. Near the intersection of Lucas and Hunt and West Florissant, police say he pointed a gun at officers and lost control of his car, hitting a silver Dodger Neon head on. Three people were inside.
