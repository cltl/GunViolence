(WZTV) - A child was accidentally shot by a toddler in Donelson on Sunday morning.\nMetro Nashville Police responded to the shooting on Blue Hills Drive at 9:30 a.m. They say a 2-year-old boy who doesn't live at the residence grabbed a gun from a door pocket of his aunt's vehicle that had just driven to the location and fired the gun, hitting his 12-year-old relative in the hip.\nThe victim, identified by police as Tyson Lucas, went to Vanderbilt Medical Center by ambulance with non-life threatening injuries. He is expected to be released from the hospital today.\nThe driver of the vehicle, according to police, can legally carry the firearm in her vehicle, but does not have a permit to carry a gun.\nSafe Tennessee Project says this is the 69th unintentional shooting so far this year, the 26th unintentional shooting involving a child under 18, and the 18th incident related to an irresponsibly stored, loaded gun.\nNo charges are filed at this time.
