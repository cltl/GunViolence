According to Rushing, the family has been evasive about details on the gun.\n\"The family has been somewhat uncooperative with investigators about where the gun may have come from or what happened to the gun after the shooting,\" he said. \"Those are things we try to determine is how did the child come into possession of a gun. Those are all things you want to try and look at during your investigation.\"\nAt this point, it's unclear if any charges will be pressed since the case is still under investigation, Rushing said. He said he's glad the child isn't badly hurt, however.\n\"We're always glad anytime someone isn't hurt real bad when something like this occurs,\" he said."}
