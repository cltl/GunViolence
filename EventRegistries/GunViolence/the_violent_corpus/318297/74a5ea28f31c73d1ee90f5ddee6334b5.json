(April 5, 2015) -- An infant is among five people shot inside a northwest side apartment around 9:30 p.m. Sunday.\nDetectives with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) were called to the 5000 block of Wildflower Court, which is near West 59th Street and Georgetown Road. Police say two women and three children ages six, four and an infant, are hospitalized in serious condition. One of the women is 24-years-old. A source says the infant was shot several times in the leg and hand.\nDetectives say there are three suspects involved and the crime is not random. Police say the suspects know the victims and they were inside the apartment when the shooting happened. There was no forced entry. Police haven't said what led up to this and are looking for either a white or grey sedan seen speeding away right after the shooting.\n\"We do know the suspects were inside the residence and there is no forced entry that we believe occurred to get into the residence,\" said IMPD Lt. Richard Riddle. \"So they were obviously inside the residence prior to the shooting. We do not have any runs to this location previously. And that\u2019s where we stand at this point.\"\nThe two adults were taken to IU Health Methodist Hospital while the three children were taken in serious condition to Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health.\nAnyone with information should call the IMPD Homicide Office at (317) 327-3475 or Crime Stoppers of Indiana at (317) 262-TIPS (8477)."}
