Cretella said Tuesday morning\u2019s testimony by New Haven Police Detective Marcin Podsiad identifying Bennett as the man in the white pompom hat opening fire in the club\u2019s surveillance videotape \u201cput it over the top.\u201d\nBut Cretella said Bennett also decided to plead guilty because \u201che didn\u2019t want the (Robinson\u2019s) family to have to watch the video again. The video showed their daughter\u2019s death.\u201d\nDuring the hearing in which Bennett pleaded guilty, Robinson\u2019s father, Gregory Fulcher, said he is still angry at Bennett. Looking straight at Bennett, Fulcher added, \u201cBut I thank you for not putting us through any more agony.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBennett pleaded guilty to the most serious charge of murder and to five of the 10 assault counts. He originally also was charged with first-degree manslaughter with a firearm and two weapons counts. The original assault charges carried two counts for each of the five wounded victims: one each for first-degree assault/discharging a firearm and first-degree assault/extreme indifference to life. The \u201cextreme indifference to life\u201d assault counts were dropped, along with the manslaughter and weapons charges, in the agreement Cretella worked out with Senior Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Michael Pepper and Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Lisa D\u2019Angelo.\nBut Superior Court Judge Patrick J. Clifford told Bennett he still faces a maximum prison sentence of up to 193\u00bd years when he returns to court Feb. 4, 2016. That\u2019s because Bennett could get up to 60 years for murder, up to 20 years for each of the assault counts and was exposed to 33\u00bd years for violating probation connected to a previous conviction.\nOne month before the club shootings, he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of narcotics with intent to sell, for which he received a five-year prison sentence, and he then violated probation by committing the crimes at the club. At that point he had not begun serving the five-year sentence.\nClifford told Bennett, who was stoic as he acknowledged all this information, that he must serve a minimum of 25 years. Bennett apparently believes he still will receive a lesser sentence than if he had continued with the trial and been convicted.\nThe trial had opened Monday with jurors repeatedly viewing surveillance videotape showing the shooting at the club on St. John Street at 3:30 a.m. Oct. 26, 2013. Some members of Robinson\u2019s family were so upset by the tape that they quickly left the courtroom.\nBennett, now 30, of Howard Avenue, had shown no emotion as he watched the videotape.\nThe other victims were Jahad Brumsey, Nijia Ward, Albert Dickerson, Amanda John and Ivette Sterling. They ranged in age from 19 to 34. Robinson, who lived in West Haven, was 26.\nAccording to the police warrant, a source quoted Bennett as saying he intended just to shoot Brumsey and nobody else. Brumsey, shot repeatedly in his abdomen, probably was the most seriously injured after Robinson. She was shot once and pronounced dead shortly after she arrived at Yale-New Haven Hospital.\nTuesday morning\u2019s testimony was provided by Podsiad, a plainclothes detective who said he knows Bennett as someone in the Newhallville neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ve been in his presence on more than one occasion.\u201d\nWhile Pepper screened a videotape of patrons being checked by security guards at the Lazy Lizard on Crown Street in the hours before the Key Club shooting, Podsiad identified Bennett as one of the men leaving and entering. That club closed at 2 a.m.\nPepper then showed a videotape of a man Podsiad identified as Bennett entering the Key Club. He said Bennett was the figure wearing a white pompom hat.\nOther surveillance cameras showed that man\u2019s appearances in other rooms of the club in the ensuing minutes. But before Pepper reached the point of the shooting, during which Podsiad was expected to identify Bennett as the gunman, Superior Court Judge Brian T. Fischer suspended testimony for the mid-morning recess.\nThe jury never heard another moment of testimony. During the recess, Cretella approached the two prosecutors to inform them Bennett wanted to plead guilty to some of the charges. Fischer then dismissed the jury and everybody else went upstairs to Clifford\u2019s courtroom for the plea hearing.\nWhen Bennett entered that courtroom, he was still wearing a red tie and dark suit but handcuffs had been put on him.\nBennett quietly answered \u201cguilty\u201d to the murder charge and five assault counts.\nClifford told Bennett that when he imposes the sentence, its length \u201cwill be up to me, after listening to the attorneys and other people\u2019s comments.\u201d This will include the relatives of the victims.\nWhen Clifford asked whether any family members wanted to speak right away in addition to on the sentencing date, Gregory Fulcher approached the podium. After thanking Clifford and the prosecution team, Fulcher also thanked \u201cthe Lord Jesus, that helped us through this from day one.\u201d\nFulcher said he remains angry at Bennett because \u201che took a great piece of us.\u201d But he thanked him for pleading guilty and told him that in prison \u201cyou\u2019ll have to get yourself together through Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nAfter court adjourned and Bennett was taken back to lock-up, Robinson\u2019s mother, Celeste Fulcher, said she, too, was thankful Bennett had admitted his guilt. \u201cThat video, it was horrifying.\u201d\nGregory Fulcher then said, \u201cThere is no justice; it\u2019s just us, standing, with anguish for the rest of our lives.\u201d\nHe praised Bennett because he came forward \u201cto man up and say: \u2018Enough.\u2019\u201d\nFulcher remarked Bennett will not be able to apologize to Robinson on earth but that if he accepts Jesus in his life, one day he will be able to see her in heaven \u201cand tell her in person that he\u2019s sorry.\u201d\nCall Randall Beach at 203-680-9345."}
