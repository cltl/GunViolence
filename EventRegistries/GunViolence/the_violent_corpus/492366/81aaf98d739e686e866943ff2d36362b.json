Three of the injured victims are female and two are male, according to police.\nAuthorities said one victim was as young as 19.

Witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots coming from the front of the club and seeing both men and women taken away on stretchers.\nThe incident was followed by a stampede as hundreds of people inside rushed for the club's main doorway, according to police.\nSurveillance video captured the whole thing, according to police.\nDuring the investigation, police discovered drug paraphernalia and packing inside the club and said the venue reeked of marijuana. The club has a BYOB policy.\nPolice said the club owners were not present at the time of the incident.\nHamilton Street was closed for several hours on Saturday morning while detectives interviewed witnesses. Police are working to identify a suspect.\nGov. Dannel Malloy and Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman together released a statement expressing their condolences to the victims' families.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the woman who died as a result of her injuries, the victims who are fighting for their lives and all who are impacted by this senseless violence,\" the statement reads. \"This is a tragic reminder that despite progress in recent years, Connecticut cities still suffer too often from the plague of gun violence. On the state, municipal and community levels, Connecticut must continue to work together to make all our communities safer.\"\nAlong with Malloy and New Haven Mayor John DeStefano, police addressed the shooting at a press conference at 2 p.m. at the New Haven Police Department Headquarters on Union Avenue.\nDeStefano proposed fees for nightclubs located in areas that require a heavy police presence and suggested police licensing and training for club security personnel.
