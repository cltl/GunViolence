Feet away, another marker sat next to the 20th bullet officers found. But neighbors said they heard way more than that.\n\u201cI heard rounds of bullets,\" said one neighbor, who did not want to be identified. \"Thirty to 40 shots, like assault rifle sounds.\u201d\nFive people were shot and one was killed at the Richmond Place Apartments early Sunday morning. Bullets flew as children slept in their beds.\n\u201cMy son's window got shot out upstairs,\u201d neighbor Ladesa Millbrooks said.\nLuckily her son was not in his room that night; Millbrooks said she is thankful he was at his grandmother's house.\nBut that\u2019s the only thing that made Millbrooks smile.\nWhile police scoured her neighborhood, Millbrooks fought back tears. She told WREG the victim killed was sleeping in a car, waiting on friends when he was struck by a bullet.\n\u201cHe will never wake up again,\" Millbrooks said. \"That\u2019s what\u2019s got my heart. That could have been my son.\"\n\u201cI\u2019m confused, I worked so hard,\u201d said Frank Gottie, who grew up in the neighborhood.\nMemphians normally see Gottie at anti-violence events. But this weekend, his message of peace hit hard when he received a call that two of his cousins were shot at the apartment complex.\n\u201cIt makes me feel like I got to push harder and harder. I got to get out here with this bullhorn,\u201d Gottie said.\nNeighbors said the complex\u2019s security gate hasn\u2019t worked in quite some time. They said they are hoping something is done soon to keep families living here a little more protected.\nOne victim remains in extremely critical condition; three others are expected to be okay.\nPolice have not released any suspect information or said what led up to the shooting."}
