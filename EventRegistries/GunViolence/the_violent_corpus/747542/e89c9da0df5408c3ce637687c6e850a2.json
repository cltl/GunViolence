Santos, of the 800 block of Atlantic Street, is facing weapons charges after police found a handful of guns in her vehicle while investigating the shooting. As a convicted felon, the 24-year-old is prohibited from possessing any firearms.\nShe was taken into custody on a parole violation. She was arraigned Thursday afternoon by District Judge Barner, who set bail at $25,000.\nBethlehem police were called to St. Luke\u2019s University Hospital in Fountain Hill shortly after 3 p.m. Monday to investigate a report of a gunshot victim. The victim told authorities that he was shot in the leg in the area of Atlantic and East Fifth streets by a man he knows only as \u201cT,\u201d according to court records.\nThe man told police he was shot accidentally by a revolver-style handgun and driven to the hospital by his girlfriend\u2019s relative.\nWhen police responded to the area of the reported shooting to locate a crime scene, officers spotted a woman later identified as Santos standing at a car parked in the 800 block of Laufer Street, according to records. Santos ran from the scene and was eventually caught after a foot chase through backyards in the neighborhood, according to records.\nA resident in the 800 block of East Fifth Street reported finding a revolver in his backyard, one of the yards through which police chased Santos.

A records check revealed she was convicted of a felony count of criminal trespass and a misdemeanor count of false imprisonment.\nPolice also learned that the silver Hyundai belonged to Santos\u2019s sister and that Santos put her own license plate on the vehicle and routinely had been driving it.\nSantos faces five counts each of prohibited possession of a firearm and carrying a firearm without a license, all felonies. Her next court date is a preliminary hearing tentatively scheduled for Jan. 30.\nCourt records make no mention of the man who allegedly fired the shot."}
