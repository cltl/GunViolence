LOUIS \u2022 Fear gripped a St. Louis neighborhood Wednesday, the night after a 15-year-old girl was fatally shot by two masked men \u2014 or boys \u2014 with assault rifles.\nThe death of Toni Stevenson came less than two months after the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old boy who attended the same school as Toni. Neighbors pointed to other shooting scenes nearby, and classmates left school Wednesday afternoon with the shootings on their minds. But few felt safe talking. Anyone could be watching, anyone could find out.\n\u201cShe was nice, funny and determined,\u201d one girl said of Toni, but even that simple statement drew warnings from her friends to shut her mouth. The girl wanted to talk, though, about the sadness she felt, and how she saw teachers crying Wednesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsafe now,\u201d the girl added as she waited for a bus. \u201cI don\u2019t trust nobody out here.\u201d\nPolice say Toni was shot just before 7 p.m. Tuesday. Toni had just driven to her home in the 6000 block of Thekla Avenue shortly after leaving a basketball game and had pulled over to park when the two gunmen ran up and opened fire. The shooters ran off.\nToni died at the scene of multiple gunshot wounds. She was the only person in the car and the only person hit by gunfire.\nLt. John Green said detectives did not believe the shooting was random. \u201cWe think they were looking for a target and they found it,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know a motive.\nToni was a sophomore at Northwest Academy of Law, a magnet high school in the St. Louis Public School District that\u2019s just a few blocks from the home on Thekla. She was on the school\u2019s basketball, volleyball and soccer teams.\nPatrick Wallace, a school district spokesman, said she was returning from a basketball game she had played in when she was killed. Northwest Academy of Law was playing at Gateway STEM High School in St. Louis.\n\u201cShe was a very academically bright child,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cVery popular, civic-minded.\u201d\nWallace said students and staff were taking her death hard. It was the second murder of a Northwest Academy student in two months, after Damani Aitch, 17, was slain in December. A spokeswoman said Wednesday that police did not believe the two shootings were related.\nDebra Jones, 50, moved to the area a few months ago and regrets it. From her bus stop, she pointed out where Toni and Damani had been killed, and said she worried for her teenage granddaughter and a young grandson.\n\u201cI want to get them out of this neighborhood,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you scared to come outside.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this. All this killing, and they are all babies.\u201d\nMotive unknown\nGreen, the police lieutenant, said he had no theories about why the girl might have been targeted.\n\u201cI kind of find it hard to believe that a 15-year-old girl would be doing something to cause this to happen,\u201d he said.\nDetectives were on the scene late Tuesday interviewing potential witnesses. Police have not released a description of the gunmen.\nToni lived on Thekla in a brick home with her 28-year-old brother, said her aunt, Jada Jenkins. Jenkins became the girl\u2019s legal guardian after Toni\u2019s mother died of cancer in 2015. She said the girl\u2019s father died several years ago.\nJenkins said she had no idea why Toni might have been targeted. She said Toni was a spirited student who got good grades and was very active at school.\n\u201cShe was life,\u201d Jenkins said through tears. \u201cNothing could get her down.\u201d\nDominique Patterson, one of Toni\u2019s cousins in Atlanta, said Toni had just gotten her driver\u2019s permit. \u201cShe was so excited. Her brother let her have her mom\u2019s car,\u201d said Patterson, 26.\nPatterson said Toni\u2019s brother wanted the best for Toni. \u201cWe all did, because she didn\u2019t have a mother or a father anymore,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cWe wanted her to move to Atlanta, with her three aunts and grandmother. But she wanted to finish her school.\u201d\nPatterson described Toni as \u201cvery quiet, never any drama.\u201d\n\u201cI know St. Louis is a rough city, I\u2019m from St. Louis, but I don\u2019t know who would want to do something like that,\u201d Patterson said.\nVideo cameras are mounted on the home where Toni lived and appear to be pointed in the direction where the shooting happened. The police spokeswoman, Schron Jackson, said investigators were reviewing surveillance video from the shooting. She did not say it came from the home.\nEthel Walker, 65, lives across the street from Toni, where she runs a day care.\nWalker saw Toni get in the car to go to school Tuesday morning, she said. That night, she heard gunshots \u201clike big shotguns.\u201d\n\u201cThe gunshots were so loud,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI never heard gunshots like that.\u201d\nWalker said she went outside and saw Toni. She ran out to the passenger seat of the car and held Toni\u2019s hand as she took her last breath, she said.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Toni, hold on,\u2019\u201d Walker said. \u201cShe looked at me like, \u2018Granny, I can\u2019t.\u2019 She still had her backpack on her back.\u201d\nThe scene is just west of Riverview Boulevard in the Walnut Park West neighborhood.\nThe night after\nAbout a dozen women and young children gathered around Toni\u2019s home Wednesday night, where they placed stuffed animals around a framed picture of Toni and lit candles in the shape of a heart around a cross.\nSome of the visitors were relatives, neighbors and Toni\u2019s childhood friends who had known her all her life; others were strangers who came by to pay their respects.\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to the walk?\u201d one person said, referring to a vigil planned for 8 a.m. Saturday where attendees plan to meet at Northwest Academy and walk to Toni\u2019s home.\n\u201cAll of us,\u201d another person responded.\nJolonda Barnes stood on the porch of Walker\u2019s home and watched the small crowd gather. She and her daughter, Sherricka Robinson, 16, had stood at the same spot Tuesday night just after the shooting.\nWalker, who is Barnes\u2019 mother and Sherricka\u2019s grandmother, had called them to the house, Barnes said. Sherricka had grown up with Toni, and the pair had been friends since they were toddlers.\n\u201cShe just stood there and watched it all,\u201d Barnes said about her daughter. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t broken down yet. We\u2019re still in shock.\u201d\nThe shooting shocked the neighborhood, said Keisha Whitney, who is also a daughter of Walker\u2019s. Many of the houses on the block have been occupied by the same families for years.\n\u201cToni wasn\u2019t just a neighborhood kid, she\u2019s family,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cWe see a lot of crime everywhere in this area, but we\u2019ve never seen something so bad happen to someone so young. People don\u2019t value life anymore.\u201d\nDenise Hollinshed and David Carson of the Post-Dispatch staff contributed to this report."}
