He did not have a concealed-carry license or an FOID card.\nSantiago\u2019s 6-year-old son got his hands on the gun in the family\u2019s apartment in the 1000 block of North Francisco just after 9 p.m. on Oct. 17, 2015, and accidentally shot his 3-year-old brother as the toddler ate a bowl of macaroni and cheese, authorities said.\nThe boys were under the supervision of their grandfather, who was in an upstairs apartment when he heard the shot.\nThe grandfather carried Eian H. Santiago from the family\u2019s apartment in the 1000 block of North Francisco about a block to Norwegian American Hospital. Eian died shortly thereafter.\nSantiago warned his elder son that the Smith & Wesson .32-caliber revolver \u2014 bundled in a pair of pajama pants atop the refrigerator in the family\u2019s garden apartment in Humboldt Park \u2014 was to be handled \u201conly by adults,\u201d prosecutors said.\nPolice said the boy was playing cops and robbers with the gun.\nThe toddler\u2019s death is hardly an anomaly: A joint investigation by USA Today and The Associated Press published earlier this month found that during the first six months of this year, minors died from accidental shootings \u2014 at their own hands, or at the hands of other children or adults \u2014 at a pace of one every other day, far more than limited federal statistics indicate.\nIn Illinois, there were 42 such accidental shootings during a 2\u00bd-year span,from Jan. 1, 2014, through June 30 of this year, the investigation found. Thirty of those shootings were in Chicago.\nEarlier this month, a 3-year-old boy fatally shot himself in the head while playing with his father\u2019s gun in north suburban Waukegan, police said."}
