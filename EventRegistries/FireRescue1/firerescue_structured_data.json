The man, a janitor at a nearby office building, stated he heard a baby crying as he approached a dumpster in the office complex.  The other witness verified that she also heard the crying and thought there might be a baby in the dumpster. The Rescue crew of three firefighter/paramedics immediately commenced a search. One firefighter climbed into the dumpster and quickly located the crying baby, a newborn boy with the placenta and umbilical cord still attached.  The crew began an immediate assessment and warming of the newborn, who appeared to be cold but otherwise healthy. The infant was transported in good condition to a nearby hospital for further evaluation and treatment. No note about the baby was found on scene. Miami-Dade Police Department is investigating the incident and urges anyone who may have information pertaining to this incident to contact them at 305-471-TIPS (8477).  In 2000, the Florida Safe Haven for Newborns statute was enacted. This statute provides that a parent can drop off an infant less than 3 days old at any Fire or EMS station or hospital without being questioned or charged with abandonment, as long as there is no evidence the baby has been abused. It is assumed that a parent taking advantage of the Safe Haven law is willing to give up all parental rights; however, the parent can reclaim the newborn without fear of reprisal at any time before parental rights are formally terminated. Prior to the passage of similar laws across the United States, approximately half of all abandoned newborns died as a result of being deserted by their parents. The Gloria M. Silverio Foundation states that 117 newborns have been saved in Florida since the law took effect. The dumpster where the baby boy was found in Kendall is within a few miles of Safe Havens at a hospital and several Fire-Rescue stations. Fortunately, the concern and willingness of two Good Samaritans to get involved helped to assure this newborn's safety.

Chattanooga fire officials have estimated the dollar loss from Monday's fire at the Airport Inn at around $750,000. Lieutenant Anthony Moore with the Fire Investigation Division said 8 to 10 rooms were damaged by fire or water. Some adjacent rooms sustained smoke damage. Fortunately, Chattanooga firefighters were able to save most of the two-story, 80-room building. No injuries were reported.\u00a0 The cause of the fire appears to be accidental in nature. Lt. Moore believes the fire actually started outside, next to the building. The burn patterns indicate that the fire started in the mulch and traveled up a wooden column into the attic. From there, the flames spread quickly through the attic until the firefighters gained access to extinguish the fire.\u00a0 As to what sparked the blaze, the exact cause may never be confirmed. However, Lt. Moore said that many cigarette butts were found in the area where the fire started. Meantime, representatives with the fire marshal's office will be checking into reports from some of the residents that the fire alarm system did not work.

Because the fire had spread to a second building, a second alarm was dispatched to the fire which brought a total of 20 fire units with 60 fire personnel to the scene. Las Vegas Metro Police also had several units on scene including three officers who arrived on scene before the fire department arrived and evacuated approximately 30 people from the two buildings. Metro then called for a CAT bus to respond to the scene so the evacuees could stay somewhere out of the cold while firefighters put the fire out. In the process, all three officers took in some smoke and were checked out by paramedics on scene. One officer was taken to UMC to be checked out as a precaution. One security officer had singed hair; he refused to be taken to the hospital. Fire investigators have ruled the fire accidental, but could not determine an exact source of ignition.

An LAFD Helicopter served the key role of aerial reconnaissance and command support as a full closure of nearby Sherman Way was ordered between Vineland and Tujunga Avenues. Los Angeles Police and Transportation officials took charge of bystander and traffic control before meeting at the Fire Department Command Post to prepare for the possible evacuation of an adjacent residential neighborhood.  The detailed yet quickly prepared plans of the three agencies however, proved unnecessary, as LAFD Hazardous Materials experts were soon joined by the firm's Chemist and Plant Manager at the scene. Together, they identified the product in the cask as being \"Manganese Dioxide\", which had apparently become contaminated, spurring the exothermic reaction and vapor production at Flamemaster Corporation, a manufacturer of sealants, adhesives, heat-resistant and fire retardant coatings.  LAFD Haz-Mat trained Firefighters used sophisticated instruments, including thermal imaging cameras, to closely monitor the temperature of the cask as water-based cooling measures were undertaken for more than two hours to lessen the reaction and vapor production, ultimately stabilizing the situation without Firefighter or civilian injury, and allowing for the reopening of Sherman Way.  The County of Los Angeles Fire Department's Health Hazardous Materials Division remained at the scene and will be working with Flamemaster staff to fully resolve matters related to the event."}]}, "FR243916": {"estimated_incident_date": "2006-11-28", "estimated_location": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "articles": [{"dct": "November 30, 2006", "title": "Major Emergency Structure Fire", "body": "On Tuesday, November 28, 2006 at 4:56 PM, twenty-eight Companies of Los Angeles Firefighters, seven LAFD Rescue Ambulances, two Arson Units, one Urban Search and Rescue Unit, one Rehab Unit, one Hazardous Materials Team, three EMS Battalion Captains, five Battalion Chief Officer Command Teams, and one Division Chief Officer Command Team, all under the direction of Assistant Chief Patrick Engel responded to a Major Emergency Structure Fire at 20800 Dearborn St. in Chatsworth.

Dispatchers reported that calls were received from tenants stating they were trapped and could not escape. The first fire company arrived within 4-minutes (0457) and reported heavy smoke and flames visible from the basement of the building and that it appeared to be extending to multiple floors. According to witnesses and Fire Officers, multiple tenants were visible through the smoke hanging out of their windows screaming for help. At least two vic tims had jumped from their apartment prior to the Fire Department's arrival. As companies began arriving, the incident commander (IC), Battalion Chief Ken Kirsch, reported a working fire due to the fire's progress and need for resources. This action resulted in the addition of an additional senior ladder, one pumper/ladder and multiple chief officers. Battalion Chief Bruce Moline was also on scene directing the tactics and individual efforts of the companies. Engine companies were immediately utilized to attack the fire and provide safety for the remaining tenants while allowing a tenable area to facilitate a search for victims. Ladder companies were directed to facilitate rescues from victims visible in windows.  Two senior ladder companies were directly responsible for six (6) documented rescues with ground ladders and aerial devices. An engine company was also responsible for rescuing one resident located in the basement apartment near to what was believed to be the fire's origin. Due to the incident's geographic location and copious amount of dense smoke throughout the neighborhood, many tenants walked to different areas after they had been evacuated. This proved to be very challenging for the on-scene personnel and resources. Paramedic Engine Companies had to be sent to identify and treat those tenants in multiple locations (sometimes blocks from the incident).

Callers were reporting black smoke and flames coming from the rear of the business. The following units were dispatched on the initial alarm; Kirwin Heights (Station 124), Kirwin Heights EMS (Station 770) and Collier Township police. Lieutenant Joseph Wissel, who was responding from the station and Lieutenant Howard Halle, who was responding from home, could see a thick plume of black smoke in the distance and immediately requested a 2nd alarm assignment. The following units were dispatched on the 2nd alarm; Bower Hill (Station 255), Glendale (Station 257), Bridgeville (Station 117) and Mount Lebanon R.I.T. (Station 198). EMS command requested that Southbridge EMS (Station 815) respond to the scene for standby. Lieutenant Wissel arrived on the scene within minutes and established Crazy Horse command. Lieutenant Wissel reported heavy smoke and fire showing from side \"C\" of the two-story concrete and wood structure. The Crazy Horse bar and restaurant was flanked by several store fronts, which became an immediate exposure threat. Command requested an immediate 3rd alarm assignment. The following units were dispatched on the 3rd alarm; Fairview (Station 268), Oakdale (Station 215) and Heidelberg (Station 170). Several employees, who were working in nearby stores at the time of the fire had safely evacuated. Engine 124-1 arrived on the scene and laid a 5\" supply line from the hydrant on the \"C-D\" corner of the shopping plaza. Crew from Engine 124-1, led by Lieutenant Halle advanced an attack line into the doorway leading to the kitchen restaurant. Lieutenant Halle made it approximately 150-feet from the door and encountered very intense heat conditions. Lieutenant Halle and his crew retreated from the structure to obtain a thermal imaging camera, to assist them in locating the main body of fire. Lieutenant Halle and crew attempted to re-enter the structure to locate the fire and initiate an aggressive attack. The thermal imaging camera revealed heavy fire conditions above the interior crew, in the ceiling area. Due to the heavy volume of fire and intense heat conditions, the interior crew again backed out of the building. Due to rapidly deteriorating interior conditions, and the fact that the outside walls had developed large cracks from the intense heat, command switched operations to a defensive mode and established a collapse zone. Truck 257 was positioned on side \"D\" of the structure and set up for aerial operations. Additional crews placed several large caliber attack lines and portable deck guns in operation on the \"C\" side of the structure, where heavy fire was visible inside two large windows. Approximately 30 minutes into the incident, the crew operating in the basket of Truck 257, reported that the rubber roof gave way and collapsed, leaving several large air conditioning units dangling from the collapsed roof. Command requested a 4th alarm assignment for additional manpower as well as three additional rapid intervention teams at approximately 7:35 a.m. The following units were dispatched to fulfill the assignment; Rennerdale (Station 126), Presto (Station 125), Upper St. Clair R.I.T.

Command requested that one additional R.I.T. can set up on the \"D\" side of the structure wit h Mt. Lebanon and that the other two can set up on the \"B\" side of the structure. Truck 117 was set up for aerial operations on the \"B\" si de of the structure and 198 Truck was set up to assist 257 Truck on the \"D\" side of the structure.  Command requested two additional aerial apparatus at approximately 7:40 a.m. Bethel Park (Station 110) and Carnegie (Station 118) were dispatched for their Trucks. Command requested that when Truck 110 and Truck 118 arrive on the scene, they are to set up on the \"B\" side of the structure and assist Truck 117 with operations. Command requested that Washington Pike (Route 50), which is the main roadway leading to Interstate 79, be shut down in both directions as large diameter hose needed to be laid from hydrants across Washington Pike to supply the additional aerial apparatus. Truck 257 crew reported heavy fire in the roof area extending the length of the roof from the \"D\" side to the \"C\" side. The crew from 117 Truck removed the facade above the vacant Casual Big and Tall store on the \"B\" side of the structure, to access the fire that was running along the voids b etween the false ceilings and roof area. Truck 110 crew removed the facade above the Dollar Tree on the \"B\" side of the structure to access the fire.  With five aerial master streams, numerous large caliber attack lines and several portable deck guns operating, crews poured copious amounts of water onto the collapsed roof, through open doors, windows and holes in the facade, for several hours before the bulk of the fire was extinguished. Command declared the fire under control at 12:30 p.m. Command advised that units would be on the scene for an extended period of time, performing extensive overhaul operations and dousing hot spots. Command requested a special alarm assignment for additional manpower to assist with overhaul and extinguishment at approximately 2:15 p.m. Whitehall (Station 301), Broughton (Station 270) and Cecil #3 (Washington County Station #10) were notified to respond to the scene.

On arrival, there was smoke showing from the basement window wells and from the rear of the building. Fire Chief Michael Kuryla called for a box alarm that brought in an additional engine, truck and ambulance, as well as a fire investigator, a rapid intervention team and a change of quarters ambulance and engine.  The fire eventually went to a 4-11 alarm, mostly because of manpower needs. Right off the bat, a water main blew. The incident was on the south end of the department\u2019s area where the water supply situation is not great. Chief Kuryla had concerns that they would lose their water, which would be especially problematic considering the potential exposure problems. As such, Kuryla had an engine establish a water supply that was delivered to the rear of the building from another community on the block behind the fire building.  According to Kuryla, upon his arrival, there was fire and pressurized smoke blowing out of three basement window wells on the east side. This home had an open-type stairwell from the basement to the second floor, and fire was blowing out of the basement 6 feet from the front door. Two lines had no effect on the fire. They were going to cut a hole in the living room floor for ventilation, but the floor was already starting to sag. Kuryla ordered all companies out, and the floor collapsed in about 5 minutes. He then announced to dispatch and over fireground that this was a defensive fire. Shortly thereafter, the entire first floor collapsed.  The fire soon spread to the second floor and the roof. Firefighters chased the fire for about 3 hours. They used a combination of handlines, master streams and a ladder pipe. They even attempted a CAFS attack early into the fire right after the floor first collapsed. Additionally, a firefighter working in the rear who was attempting to remove a door with a fire stream fell into the burning basement.

This information, relayed to firefighters/dispatchers at LAFD's operations control dispatch section, brought the well-coordinated response of an additional 149 Los Angeles Fire Department personnel on the ground and in the air. In accordance with LAFD's high rise incident command system, firefighters established firm control of key building systems, including a recall of elevators to the lobby level of the 17-year-old building, as firefighters, carrying as much as 100 pounds of equipment each, commenced a steady climb up more than 40 flights of stairs to do battle with fire in the upper reaches of the third-tallest building in Warner Center. With detailed knowledge of the structure gained during fire prevention and annual fire department high-rise drills proudly hosted by building management, firefighters made strong headway to the 17th floor, where they found fire in an electrical room and smoke charging the 17th through 20th floors as well as machine rooms above. As an LAFD helicopter cross-staffed with an airborne engine company circled overhead, fire attack and support teams established staging on the floor below the fire, optimizing a strategic assault that confined the fire to the electrical room and fully abolished flames in little more than an hour. There were no injuries related to the fire. Subsequent to firefighting operations, firefighters systematically searched the buildings many elevators and associated systems to discover a woman trapped in a 'blind' segment of a split-bank elevator that served only floors 12 and above from the lobby. Finding the one elevator car stuck at the 'fourth floor' level of the sealed shaft, firefighters established verbal contact with the woman, who was uninjured and not exposed to smoke. After redundantly securing the elevator, firefighters used power tools to breach the elevator shaft wall from a fifth floor storage room, and then used a 12-foot fire department ladder within the shaft to access the woman. Following a cursory evaluation of her condition and affirming her capabilities, she was gently assisted in climbing the ladder, and exited safely to decline further treatment or transportation.

Despite warm weather and a lack of appreciable rain for weeks, several local flood control channels remained swollen with retained water runoff. In response to a 9-1-1 call reporting a teenage male in distress within the Pacoima Wash, 40 LAFD personnel on the ground and in the air responded quickly to strategic positions along the concrete lined tributary, which had nearly three feet of cold water traveling at a brisk 15 miles-per-hour. As firefighters deployed to pre-planned rescue points, it was soon determined that the young man was in a fixed but precarious position, clinging to the base of a 24 foot vertical channel wall adjacent to Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Aware that the victim was a short distance from the churning waters of a dangerous dam, LAFD personnel from Fire Station 98 shouted words of encouragement while throwing a tethered flotation device to the youth, who had articles of clothing ripped from his body by the force of the water during his more than three-mile downstream journey. A member of Fire Station 98's crew, already clad in swift water rescue gear, placed himself into a rescue harness as an LAFD aerial ladder was extended over the channel. Secured by ropes and suspended from the ladder being used in a \"crane-like\" fashion, the firefighter was carefully lowered into the rushing water in front of the boy, and while shielding him from the elements, secured the 15-year-old Sylmar resident to his harness. Then, with both gentleness and precision, the two were raised to the dry and warm street level above - and the arms of waiting LAFD paramedics. The entire operation, from receipt of the first 9-1-1 call to the boy's release from the harness at ground level, took less than 22 minutes. There were no other victims and no firefighter injuries were reported. The mildly hypothermic boy, who also suffered numerous lacerations and abrasions, was quickly wrapped in warm blankets and taken to an awaiting ambulance, where his cold, damp clothes were removed and his wounds cleaned and dressed. Warming measures were instituted during his transport to nearby Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. Paramedics, who declared the boy to be in good condition, described him as polite, contrite and genuinely thankful for their efforts.

Guided by the LAFD Computer-Aided Dispatch system and firefighter/dispatcher's expertise, Pacoima-based Engine Company 98 was sent downstream to a pre-planned rescue point near the intersection of Del Sur Street and Haddon Avenue. Traveling rapidly and unimpaired to the scene as they donned flotation vests, sneakers and water rescue headgear, they alighted from the engine at lightning speed with bolt cutters to rapidly breach a locked gate and then position their apparatus swiftly as a hard-point to anchor rescue - or recovery - operations from alongside the trapezoidal channel.

The Los Angeles Fire Department was informed that A Jet Blue Air Bus, with one hundred and forty-five passengers and crew-members had departed Bob Hope Airport in Burbank en route to JFK Airport in New York had discovered a problem with its landing gear. The pilot was directed to divert to Long Beach Airport for an emergency landing. On a low altitude fly-by at Long Beach Air Port, it was quickly ascertained by the tower that the nose gear of the aircraft was not properly in place for a routine landing.  Due to the position of the nose gear at a 90-degree angle and the problem that may ensue upon landing, the aircraft was directed to land at LAX on Runway 25Left, the southern most runway. At approximately 6:17 p.m. PDT, with LAFD resources strategically place along the runway and staged at a near by fire station, Jet Blue Flight 292 landed safely on runway 25 left amid sparks, smoke, and flames from the burning tires.

The first Company arrived quickly to discover heavy fire showing from the garage attached to a one-story single family home.  According to witnesses, the home\u2019s sole resident had been in the garage using a bench grinder when sparks ignited nearby ordinary combustible items. The adult male was able to escape unharmed, but the flames soon spread in the heavy storage of the garage and extended rapidly through the attic and flammable wood shake roof to threaten a pair of single-family homes adjacent to 1,400 square-foot wood-frame structure. Firefighters mounted a fierce interior assault on the swift-moving flames, but were hampered to gain access in much of the fifty-five year-old structure due to pack-rat conditions throughout the dwelling. During fire attack, one Los Angeles Firefighter sustained first-degree burns to his ear. In fair condition, he was transported to Sherman Oaks Community Hospital. Despite the stubborn flames that consumed the attic and much of the excessive storage throughout the home, Firefighters spared the northwest portion of the structure from serious damage, and extinguished the flames in just forty minutes.  No other injuries were reported. Loss from the fire, which took nearly four and one-half hours to overhaul due to the pack-rat conditions, is estimated at $350,000 ($250,000 structure & $100,000 contents).
